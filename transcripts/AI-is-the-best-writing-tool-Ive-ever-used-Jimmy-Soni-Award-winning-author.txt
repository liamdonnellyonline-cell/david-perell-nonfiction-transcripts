What makes you so excited about what's happening with AI? >> I think of it as the most unbelievable tool I've ever seen to improve every single part of the work I do. Like I am I have been blown away. I've been a power user now for a year and a half, right? Like just aggressively using every tool that comes out, trying to understand the intricacies of the tools, like stay trying to stay ahead of a field that's rapid rapidly developing. My interest in this is purely at the level of like tooling like what tools are being developed for people like me to do our work better. And honestly there there's been one other moment when I've been this blown away and it was the first time I connected to the internet. Like the first time I connected to the internet, I was like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm connected to literally everything and everyone if I want to be the the great challenge for any kind of writer is one of the great challenges is like simply like getting stuff on the page that you think reflects the thing in your head. You have an image in your head >> and in your head it's perfect. It's like every pixel is exactly where it needs to be. Now you need to describe that image to somebody else. And that's where the challenge is. M >> AI helps you do that better and faster. How does it do that? Well, I'll give you an example actually from just a couple days ago. I am I'm working to edit in my role as a as a publisher. I'm working to edit a book about grief. And the woman who wrote the book lost her daughter uh two years ago. There's a section in the book where she talks about how Judaism emphasizes the need for the body to be buried and in the ground very very quickly. Yes. >> You're supposed to wait a maximum of 3 days. That's the outer limit or something. >> Yeah. Basically, I think the the soul or the spirit leaves the body after 3 days. >> Yeah. And she talks about how there's actually a decent amount of writing in like Jewish liturgy about the importance of the speed, like why the speed matters, where does that come from? >> And there's sort of two like abiding explanations, right? And and one is that the spirit needs to to be back to God as quickly as possible or back to this back to you know the heavens as quickly as possible. The other is that bodies if they were left out could become decayed. They would start to like the the the flesh itself would would start to smell and rot and all these other things. And so there was a there was a reason that was spirit and there was a reason that was flesh. I wanted to understand that better and to understand what the rabbitical sources said about that better so that I could confirm that one she was telling me like she was speaking the truth. I'm not Jewish. I don't come from this tradition. But also if in case I missed anything like did we miss any quotes or ideas or something from the Talmud that should be in here. Could I like go and spend a month like really getting you know understanding Judaism? Sure. But instead, I could use AI to like take the paragraph and and ask AI to really give me sources and quotes and texture and nuance and please explain, you know, what this word means and what this word means, like is this the actual explanation? And it gave me really incredible thoughts so that I could verify the information. I could share some things with her that I learned that might make for better editing, right? like it actually enhanced that paragraph taking it and putting it in AI and just asking it a series of questions. There are people who could say that's unfair and I would say well all I did was just Google on steroids, right? Like all I did was just like Google what I what would have taken me 10 Google searches took me one query with Claude. The the point is that I think what it does is it one it enhances your ability to research and it allows you to pull sources together that you wouldn't have otherwise thought about. Right? There's a second thing. Psychologically, having an editor that's always on call is new and super powerful. I It used to be, and it still is, that you have editors and they help you punch up your work, right? No writer works alone. They have people who work with them. I now have the world's greatest editor, the world's smartest editor who never complains, who never gets tired, who never turns off. So, if I'm working at 4:00 in the morning and I need my editor, I've got it. It's right there. So, if I have a paragraph that feels flabby or if I have a word that doesn't quite sit right, I can put it in and say, "What are some other options for this?" or "What's wrong about this?" Right? So, that's like the editorial function. There's another important function that I use it for. Sometimes, particularly with opeds, when I have an oped I've finished or something I've written where there's an argument, like a real argument, I will have Claude argue the opposite position for me. I will have it write take write a takedown of this oped. That's a great >> please criticize in 700 words this op-ed and I tell it I said and do not hold back. I'll like add personality to it. >> Once I see how it's criticized the piece, I can then go back to my piece and strengthen it against those criticisms because everybody's got blind spots. And so I have to actually be able to like unearth those blind spots so that I can address them. And I would say nine times out of 10 the arguments that it makes really force me to stop and think. Everything I've just described obviously has hazards. There are hallucinations. There are problems. There are times when it gets source material wrong. But that's the whole point of human operators running these these, you know, these LLMs and using them judiciously. I'm not substituting for the work of getting up every day and doing writing. I'm using the tools in the places where it matters. And I cannot emphasize enough how much better and faster my work is as a result.
