hi everyone welcome back to the broadcast so in this episode we have with us David Pharrell and David Burrell is one of my writing idols and thank you so much Dave for taking the time to do this he has done a lot of stuff in writing he has his right of passage which is a course that teaches a lot of students how to write better he's the host of the North Star broadcast where he hosts brilliant educators learners and has a strong community which is driven by the passion for their own creative expressions and his essays are some of the most fantastic ones some of the ones that really struck me were you know the coolest things I learned in 2019 the annual review 2019 learn like an athlete and the never ending now and he's also as I said the creator of the writing course rite of passage and yeah I guess that is pretty much it thank you so much for taking the time to come today yeah thanks for having me I'm happy to be here yes so I guess in this episode I'm not going to ask you or at least I'll try not to ask you a lot of the basic questions I'm assuming that the listeners who would be listening to this particular episode already know a lot about you so I guess I'll dive right in and so anyway get to the point about you know how I got introduced to you and then ask you a few questions some of which I've already talked about briefly in terms of consuming content producing content writing and thinking and just in the end about some life advice and skill sets so in terms of how I got introduced to you so that's a really an interesting story I met a software engineer at uber and her name is shravanti yeah and she actually told me oh you know her boyfriend's one of my best friends oh that's that's super cool and she told me about you know just getting onto Twitter and she introduced me to you so then I read these a few of your essays and went through your tweets that just gotten SuperDuper excited because for the first time I had witnessed like pure originality and just a form of genuine voice something that I had not witnessed earlier in terms of you know my other search for self-improvement and other kinds of advice and then I recently also interacted with Salman and with whom he also had a video yeah exactly so I found that this community of learners that I guess you know more or less is ranging in the same area so that's why I thought it'd be great to reach out and do this podcast so diving right in my first question is about consuming content and I know that Twitter is one of the you know platforms that you use very often and you and you're very bullish on Twitter given that we live in an age of sort of content abundance and limited time how do you pick and choose books articles podcasts and how do you essentially consume so much content yeah I actually don't consume as much as you think but I also consume a lot so part of it is it's my whole job to consume content that was always my goal so when I was in college I remember reading certain people like Alex Danko and Ben Thompson and Kevin similar and I remember saying the way that these people think is how I want to think and I enjoyed consuming content so much because what I found was when you could learn on the Internet you could dive so much deeper into ideas and by learning from generally specific individuals instead of publications you were getting much more raw and unfiltered perspective into the world and that was really interesting to me so I guess the first thing I would say is yeah it's my job to consume content but in terms of then how I do consume a lot and actually managing information abundance I think that there's way too much emphasis placed on how to choose what you consume and there's not enough emphasis placed on the filters that you have and what you want to do is basically climb up the funnel so that the things that get filtered to you or a very high quality and that's where I would begin this process I'm pretty ruthless about making sure that from the things I'm consuming there are at least recommended sources from different places so I guess I could give you a couple buckets here so the first you could just say is email newsletters I subscribe to a great newsletter called the browser browser I read Tyler Cowens blog marginal revolution I subscribe to a number of creators and I just look for little signals so it's so in the flow of things that I almost can't even remember but like I'm just looking for things that resonate a little bit more from places that are generally obscure so for example I found one today from newsletter from Justin Murphy who's a writer who's exploring sort of indie writers and creators on the internet and he was recommended a newsletter about an article about Max Weber who sociologist and early as 20th century and I'd been studying Weber and I saw okay this looks interesting I had been studying wave Weber by auditing a class at Columbia and therefore the synthesis of the two from a person who I trust I've now basically gone through so much filtering there that now when I sit down to read that article I know that it's going to be of high quality but then what I do is I never come across an article and read it right away and this is pretty important I always save it to Instapaper or I save it to pocket and that way what ends up happening is when I actually sit down to read which isn't a lot of time maybe an hour a day what ends up happening is all the articles all the books they have to compete for my attention and then I just read what I feel like reading okay so I guess at that time you're so in the moment that it's the decision that you make is sort of intuitive it's not it's not based on certain predefined filters that you know if this article is from X friend in Y magazine only then but I read it yeah very intuitive I'm extremely intuitive about most things I do set up rules and systems on the back because they really help other people but I very rarely set up a system beforehand so what I do is I just follow and this has to do with how I think about business opportunities it has to do with how I think about writing it has to do with how I think about information consumption I'm very intuitive and then I look back on things in retrospect and I say okay what am I actually doing here what is the 90 percent that I can put into a series of systems and then begin to share that with other people got it and and and that's how you sort of you know produce content also like once you've consumed it you begin sharing and that's that also helps you internalize the content better and also share it with the world yeah exactly I mean for me it's just like what am i excited about so if I sit down and I have an epiphany okay just send that tweet on Wednesday you know I try to move pretty fast so on Wednesday I had an idea because I'd been talking to different college students and I'd actually be curious on your take here is don't go back to college in the fall don't go back to class so I put that out on Twitter it obviously struck a chord and I'm just looking for things that resonate so things that are charged in the right way I don't like charged things that are politically charged and stuff like that that doesn't really interest me but things that are interesting ideas it's very hard to know which of your ideas are interesting and which ones art so I just throw out a lot of tweets probably 3035 tweets a week and then I'm just paying attention okay what's resonating and then so I published that tweet on Wednesday 21 hours later I had a article published and so then twelve hours after the article was published I got in touch somebody through the Chan Zuckerberg Institute introduced me to somebody at the Harvard School of Education and that's just 48 hours from idea to introduction and I think that really gets into how I think about writing where a lot of people think about writing as an end in itself okay we're gonna learn grammar we're gonna learn sentence structure we're gonna learn paragraphs and it's just not very interesting to me first of all and second of all a lot of that stuff's actually getting automated so you can use Hemingway you can use grammerly and it takes care of these things for you and like it my spelling is terrible and then what ends up happening the reason why writing is interesting to me in the way that I think about writing fundamentally differently from other people is that writing is just a way to create opportunities and a way to beat people in the same way that for you that's what podcasting is got it I think I think that that makes a lot of sense thank you so much for for how you you know consume content and substructure it in your own mind and intuitively approach different pieces of information especially during this age my second question was about you know more on the side of producing content and at the same time of which you consume so much how is it possible or what frameworks do you use in order to condense the information in to 40 characters as well as write in long form articles yeah I mean they're very different so when it comes to Twitter the way that I think about things is how can I provide as much information and as much novelty or interestingness in a very short number of characters so I think that my style on Twitter is like here is an entire semester of what you would learn as your bullet points in a writing syllabus okay that's just one tweet and so somebody will read that and I have what I call the screenshot test then the screenshot test is I like writing tweets that make somebody say oh my goodness that's really insightful I need to screenshot that so I can save it for the future and so today I have quite a high bar for Twitter and I think that one of the things that people get wrong is people think of Twitter is such a menial platform where it's like oh it's just the tweet it doesn't really matter but Twitter's also the most important Media company in the world like it is where the influencers are influenced if you're the President of the United States if you're a major journalist if you're the CEO of a company like stripe like Shopify like like Twitter itself all those people are on Twitter and so everybody's thinking of Twitter is like oh you know it's just this this this little business no Twitter is where the world leaders get their information and so rather than taking Twitter as the least serious we should take Twitter extremely seriously knowing that those people can actually read our stuff if we have a really good tweet so that's what I would say first don't think about going viral mmm don't think about much except will this make if I saw this tweet would it make my feed way better and if that's the case then tweet it like all you're trying to do is like improve the experience for other people help them learn faster give them a laugh give them a surprise if you are taking responsibility for actually making the feed of your users who are smart who are busy who are curious who have a high bar for information quality if you can take that release seriously and you can say everything I publish is gonna be of ultra high quality then you're gonna begin to attract an audience that really appreciates that got it and and in terms of long-form writing I was wondering about your research process and you know again huh what are the frameworks do you use in order to sort of you know write those long-form articles that you've already written yeah so I think that I would start by saying school teaches us to research first and write second I write first and research second so I don't do much research at all for those essays but there's a lot of research in it so how does that make sense let me Elena so one of the biggest issues with the way that we're taught to write is nobody has a note-taking system I mean it's just absolutely ridiculous that you would go through college and you would learn all these things and I don't know where my notes are from college I guess I learned all these things I don't know what I learned in media history because the semester ends and you just throw away your notes you do the same thing with same things with your essay you just sophomore years over let's throw them away okay our master's program is over let's throw them away it's ridiculous okay so what you should be doing is aggregating a really good knowledge management system day by day week by week month by month and what you find is you write long form essays once you just have enough information already compiled to just write the essay so like I probably wrote one of if not the go-to essay on Peter Till's philosophy and framework yes by the time I wrote that I'd already read zero to one his his core book I'd already had a book club on it I'd already read many of his essays I'd already read much analysis of his I'd already rewatched all of his lectures from Stanford University the class that he gave and then I began to see I'd already studied Rene Girard who influenced he'll and I just began to see oh I already learned something from just having fun now I know exactly what to write about and I think that the problem is when you don't have a note-taking system you have to go back and do all that research over and over and so I basically have this ridiculous superpower which is because my note-taking system is so good and I teach this and write a passage the exact one I use because my note-taking system is so good I can look like I'm spending all this time breeding I can look like I'm spending all this time consuming but as I told you at the beginning of the podcast I mean I spend a lot of time consuming but not nearly as much as you think and I'm a very slow reader so I just do research just to fill in some gaps at the end but you could almost think of it like like bricks and mortar like I already have the bricks I just need to do a little research to have the mortar so the bricks stick together got it so like each time you read an article you know which which could be just out of interest or you know for any long-form article in the future do you always take notes right up to your breath that article I take notes while I read the article so what I do is I save everything into Instapaper and then I highlight all the important parts and then I do the same thing in Kindle so like if I find something that resonates and once again it's very intuitive process then I'll just write a note in in Instapaper or in Kindle and I'll say this is what I'm thinking so very often what I'll do is I'll even start producing as I'm consuming so say I read something like colleges it's 27 percent of colleges say that they are in a financially difficult spot for the fall semester then I'll say oh do two like I will write this in my note I will say oh this just sparked an idea due to the macro-environment situation right now if students don't go back for the Fall if 27 percent are already in a fund in a position of financial stress at least five percent of them will go out of business then what I'll say is I'll keep reading and as I read an article I'm now thinking about this idea of these colleges might go out of business they are gonna need students they're in a really tough economic place I could literally finish an article and just buy my notes as I read have everything I need for so the thing is I think of production and consumption as almost two of the same things like when I consume things I'm always thinking of what am I gonna produce because I just care about production whereas the way that most people think about this stuff is like I mean it baffles me right like your attention is so scarce why would you ever spend all these hours reading a book then never have a conversation with somebody about that book so then you forget it I try to do a book club for the vast majority of books I read then not even take notes on the book so then by the time you have to go do research you have to go back and read the thing and then when you're reading those things you're just consuming again and your research process is very slow and very manual and then you finish the essay and you throw away the notes every single chain of that system which is exactly how we're taught to things is wrong every single one and so that they could actually flip these things it's not that hard it's just that we're thinking of writing in a pre-internet pre digital pre information abundance paradigm I see I see a point over there but I think my question also like as a follow-up question comes to the point that if you say that production and consumption are two sides of the same coin and you think of them as interlinked and you start producing as you're consuming I I worry if it's possible for say the writer to engage at a very deep level with the content that they're producing and not at a shallow level which just picks random snippets or facts or ideas and summarizes them and repackages them and you know dentally verse and the reason i ask this question is because I find myself also in the same field in the sense that I try to produce as I consume because otherwise I don't see you know it doesn't feel productive to me but I also at times think to myself whether I'm just repackaging Andrey summarizing the content and not producing anything new so how do you sort of navigate that yeah it's a great question um great question well okay let me just take there's two questions in there so the first thing is you don't always have to produce as you consume and I just gave you a very intense example of what this looks like at the very least you should be reading digitally and saving your highlights like just at the very least base level right because there's actually times where it's really nice to just consume stuff and you can just sort of sit back and just chill like I get it right you don't always need to do this but to get to your second question about are you just repackaging insights well the way that ideas work generally is I would say there's two kinds of ideas so the first is it's fine to repackage ideas like if you can actually summarize somebody else's ideas say that you read an eighty thousand page book and you need to write a six thousand page essay on it you have now like my partner did this Thiago my business partner he runs a course called building a second brain and he's an excellent summarizer so he summarized a book called how to take smart notes and wrote like a six thousand word summary on it that for many people is actually better than the book like he is adding stuff to it and when you do that kind of summary that's when you really understand a book like information is like food you can't just put food through your mouth and get nutrients you have to actually digest information and in food we digest in our stomach and our stomach needs to process that with information we need to play with it like you know like play-doh we need to actually grapple with it see how things stretch see how things contract see how things move when we combine them in new ways and we take these existing ideas we flip them a couple times just like a Rubik's Cube and then we have the same basic format but a whole new set of colors on the Rubik's Cube and we're now seeing the same thing through new lens so let me just say that questioning the premise of what you're saying you don't need to be original in anything and like that process of deep digestion through summary really helps you learn things that's the first thing the second thing is there's an idea in complexity science called emergence and what emergence is is that the sum is greater than its parts just don't you end up getting into these things that are called phase transitions so if you take something like water going into ice you have the exact same general molecules and then as they go from 35 degrees to 34 to 33 to 32 to 31 to 32 degrees that water becomes ice and so what you have is a fundamentally the same basic the same basic elements but now it they're displaying themselves in a different format and my point in saying this is once you do a really good summary you begin to see opportunities for your own intellectual phase transitions where you're building off of other people of course but as you actually engage with ideas and they begin to turn in your brain you begin to see them with this tremendous depth and then you can apply them to new fields so let me give you an example ideas what they do is they start in one place and then they work their way up to other places often over hundreds of years so if you start with the Bible the first and the Ten Commandment Commandments are are are about not copying others and not idolizing false gods don't covet your neighbor's goods and what you see is those two are arguably the two most important Commandments and even going back to the Cain and Abel story that is a story of rivalry it's a story of conflict and a lot of stories and myths throughout human history they go back to twins and siblings and how much conflict and tension there is among people who are kind of the same and then you have Rene Girard who comes out and he says that same that we get into conflict not because we're different but because we're the same right like you see this in Romeo and Juliet the at the very beginning of the play it is two houses both alike in dignity meaning the two homes of Romeo and Juliet they are the same and how does the play end with tremendous tragedy from a conflict right so we fight with people not who were the same but who are different and that is one of the fundamental tenants of mimetic theory and then what you have is Peter teal when he goes and he starts PayPal he doesn't want any mimetic conflict yes in PayPal so what does he do he has every single person be responsible for one thing and one thing only and that's to reduce mimetic conflict that's to reduce the Cain and Abel syndrome that's to reduce and to go against the warnings of the 1st and the 10th commandments and so what you see is even in the company structure of PayPal it goes back to the Bible and you can actually trace the lineage of that idea and you can say oh that's interesting and it gets back into Rubik's cubes it gets back into emergence and it gets back into all the themes that I've been discussing Wow I think that was definitely a really full answer I think I'll have to we watch this entire segment just to sort of truly internalize what you've what you've said because I know that there is a lot of depth over there and the way you've summarized and the way you have said that as a first step summarizing ideas is okay because as you continue doing that over a period of time and you continue engaging with them even though at a cordon code shallow level because you're producing and consuming at the same time eventually you would be able to notice this pattern and obviously supplemented by a good note-taking system you would be able to notice this pattern basis which you can stand on the shoulders of chance and produce something that is incredibly valuable and something that did not exist before but the step to reach that is definitely followed by is preceded by all of these steps in which you have to first produce and consume at the same time I think I think that definitely makes a lot of sense to me and does clarify my my reservation about producing and consuming you know the whole idea of originality is just it's kind of crazy and it comes I think there's a lot of pressure that we get in school like what's the worst thing that you can do in school English class plagiarize plagiarize right yeah like it's it's it's like oh the the holy grail of plagiarism right it's like oh yeah what's gonna happen yes you know something's gonna happen if you plagiarize you get kicked out of school you're gonna lose it's the worst thing you could ever do yeah so what ends up happening is that we're running away from like the Grim Reaper of plagiarism that's the word I was looking for the Grim Reaper of plagiarism I like that term and so what is happening is the Grim Reaper's chasing us and we're just like this is the worst thing so then we don't go anywhere close to it and then what ends up happening is because we're so obsessed with being original we don't actually build on top of everyone's ideas and it's just not the way that things work at all I mean I spent a lot of time studying different people and studying different writers and like go look at the the the bibliography for a book from Nassim Taleb it is like 15 pages an 8-point font of all the books that he's cited and then you know one of my favorite things to do with people is say that you find someone that you really liked you asked about information consumption at the beginning best way to find book recommendations find one person that you like and read all their favorite books and so I did this for example with Thiago Forte so when I found Thiago like his build a a second brain course changed my life so deeply and I just said this guy is a literal genius and then I started reading all of his favorite books like principles of product development flow braking smart and then I was like oh wait yeah tacos really smart but he's got all these other people's ideas and then rubik's cube dome and then turn them into a fundamentally new output and i've done this with so many different people and what you just realize is that ideas aren't original and there's a very wide canyon very wide and school just brushes over this with no nuance between plagiarism which is obviously awful and borrowing other people's ideas to build off of them with due credit which is like what the intellectual project of humanity is i think that's a wonderful it but i think that's one of people i guess moving on because i know that you know you're you're short on time i wanted to talk a little bit about skill sets and skills i read your tweet a few days ago in which he said you know learn to code write sell and what was the poor thing code right sell and speak speak yeah and you said polite I was just wondering more about two things one it seems to me from your writing and tweets and in general that you value writing much more than any other skill yet you know at the senior levels of any company everyone is a corporate writer and you know every remote worker is a writer and so on and so far then you extrapolated it to a lot of fields so the first question is whether you think that Ewing things in general in life from the prism of writing is a safe or a useful lens and the context I ask this question is in the aphorism of you know when you have only one hammer do you begin everything starts to look like a name so that's the first question and the second question is it seems to me as a non quantitative skills like writing and I may be wrong even on the premise of saying that like in general being in the tech ecosystem of Silicon Valley are not as valued or marketable by other people as current quote quantitative skills like coding math and you know like those kinds of things in general so I wonder what your thoughts are on these two particular scenarios yeah so let's put it this way I mean if I were to add a fifth to that I would say what I could teach my kids which was really the context of this I would say learn to code so that you can talk to computers then learn to write learn to speak and learn design so that you can talk to humans and learn to sell so that you can make money that's yeah how I would think about this and when it comes to writing and having the hammer in the nail I don't think I'm saying at all that the other skills aren't valued but I do think that there's something fundamental about writing which then helps you think better for all the other skills so let's just take those five skills design code selling speaking and writing so yeah I I think of writing underneath the other ones because if you can write well about something writing isn't us isn't only the skill of writing it is the skill of thinking it is the skill of taking the world and organizing it in such a way that it's men Chabal and that what used to be abstract becomes clear yeah and when you can write you can actually take like the Constitution you can have something that stands the test of time without entropy really that then now 350 million Americans or whatever it is can actually treat that document as something that is of importance of value and we place that document above any individual person the rule of law in America at least in theory stands above any individual person over the course of human history that's a major achievement right many feudal systems for example it was what the King said was the rule of law and you see that in many parts of the world that's part of what makes America attractive to people provided that that's true and my point in saying this is that once you could actually write well about a topic which is basically synonymous with thinking well you can't like write well about something without thinking well about it well then it actually becomes easier to speak so if I talk about writing the reason I can talk about writing better than I can talk about most other subjects is I've already worked out these ideas on paper like when I sit down to write for 90 minutes a day I'm actually thinking for 90 minutes a day but thinking there's a famous Rodin statue that's that's that's a Columbia University it's also very famous so see it everywhere it's called the thinker and it is just thinking like that statue is thinking and the the right knuckle is pointed at the bottom of the chin as as as the statue is hunched over and that's how we think about thinking and I just beg to differ I think that you think about thinking by writing and so what you do when you write is you write and rewrite but really what you're doing is you're thinking Andrey thinking and what's great about writing is all your ideas are there and so then you can rethink through them so then what happens is now when you start selling well you've already written out the arguments that you're gonna make both emotional Zoar pathos ethos and logos to use the Greek system of this you're you've already put that out there and said this is how I'm going to sell the product and you've done it writing so it's way easier then when you go to code you've already thought through okay what are the parameters for this and how as an individual or as a team how are we thinking about this product this piece of software that we're building when you go to design you're ready thinking maybe this is more symbiotic with design but you can communicate an idea with writing and by design but also like for any design project you want to write out a scope and and and stuff like that and then very clearly for speaking like what you're doing when you're speaking eloquently is your Reese Aang some of the things that you've already written so when I interviewed Neil deGrasse Tyson arguably the most famous astrophysicist in the world he told me that he almost never says anything in public that he hasn't written down before and I don't do that but I took that to heart in that the reason that he's so famous is because he's so eloquent and the reason he's so eloquent is because he is speaking what he's already written got it got it I think I think that really answers that the hammer nail analogy is probably not the perfect one because there are these host of other skills that also surround writing and writing is sort of like the bedrock of all these skills which allows you to do better in speaking in writing that design talk and essentially just being an eloquent speaker as far as the second part of the question about the quantitative and not quantitative I was wondering if you had any thoughts on that yeah do you want to just reframe the question I want to make sure that I answer it properly yes I was wondering do you feel that non quantitative skills like writing are actually more or equally valuable as quantitative ones like coding because in Silicon Valley coding is I mean in the market me it's valued more than say writing yeah so actually there was a really interesting study that came out that said that what you see with coding and this is just one study it was from the New York Times so it's a fairly credible publication but do you take it with a grain of salt but it looks like the plateau on pure coding is actually like what ends up happening is you make a very high salary early in your career but then it begins to to siphon off later on so say that you're graduating college and you want to get a good first paying job something that's respected of enough something that makes makes $200,000 a year yeah you want to probably go studied math and statistics and machine learning and coding like absolutely that's a great place to be and I don't want to say that any of these skills were like better or worse the others like I can't I would never be able to do those things like it's just not how I brain works like for me I'm best when I can go be creative and stuff like that and but then what happens is later in your career you're not coding like Patrick Collison the CEO of stripe isn't coding Mark Zuckerberg the CEO and recent IPO Netscape he wasn't coding and all of them benefit from knowing how to code don't get me wrong I actually think it's part of our soul for the job but what you see is that to like just be banging your fingers on the keyboard broadly I think has a smaller upside than writing itself but there's plenty exceptions to this and knowing how to do both is really what's great but Mark Zuckerberg spends a lot more time typing words for prose than he does typing letters for code got it I think I think need to be Mark Zuckerberg like my point is yeah they're either yeah they're both super helpful yeah absolutely and just last question before we sort of wrap up really cool real quick what is a skill or habit that you wish you would have started earlier knowing that you know looking back at life you think would have benefited you in terms of writing life style or just general on your learning journey workout seriously I why do you say that because it's your body like I think that if I have one criticism of of Silicon Valley culture is it places the mind way above the body and I'm much more interested in a symbiosis between mind and body and like it's your body you only have one of them and your body is what lets you go out and and and do things and the more I study longevity the more I study health I mean even something as simple as coronavirus look at how much better off people who didn't have respiratory conditions who weren't obese look at how much better off they did and there's something very weird in society where we've normalized obesity but we have 71 percent of Americans over 20 who are overweight we have 19 percent of Americans like two through 19 or obese it's something crazy like that we have a country that has normalized being out of shape that has normalized eating chunk and processed food and it's awful I mean my favorite room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's is the Greek statues and these bodies for the men are like there they're just absolutely beautiful with these chiseled arms and just an amazing show and you know if we go back to Greek literature the Greeks gave us a lot of the intellectual capital of what our modern society is founded on they gave us Plato they gave us Aristotle they gave us Socrates they gave us the modern conceptions of how governments are run and it's probably not a coincidence that they also also gave us the Olympics and getting in shape the same things that you need to get in shape of diligence of showing up when you don't feel like feel like it of okay how do I do this how do I hold myself accountable when nobody else will nobody else in life is going to care more about your own success than you like it is your job to do that and when it comes to building the habit but also when it comes to just living a rich life you want to have an incredible body in terms of not just the aesthetics of it which is how most people hear that but a body that allows you to hey let's go for a hike yeah I'm in hey I need to sit down and write for two hours without getting distracted and to think at a very high level yeah let's do it and being in really good shape pays incredible dividends and it's the single working out is the single most important habit I've ever built got it got it thank you thank you so much all of these questions were definitely very well answered and they've
