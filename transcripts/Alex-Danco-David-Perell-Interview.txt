so hi everybody I'm David Ferrell I run an online course called rite of passage which starts the next cohort starts on Wednesday in that I have taught more than 400 people to write for more than 40 countries there are some alums on the call right now great to see all of you and some other people who are going to be joining in the new cohort so thank you all for the people who are here so basically this is part of what I'm calling writing week and so it's a series of different writing workshops just like this one and there's two live interviews so with Alex today with Nathan Barry the CEO of convertkit on Thursday I'm doing a lot of writing workshop tomorrow I'm doing another one Saturday a live Q&A on Sunday I also just launched a rite of passage podcast of with 20 episodes that are all two to six minutes long so this is the week of writing all to celebrate that read a passage course which begins on Wednesday and basically the back story here with Alex is before I ever started writing I remember sitting on a beanbag chair on a Friday afternoon in college this is my senior year when I was just trying to get my [ __ ] together and I remember reading Alex's writing and say oh is saying oh my goodness this guy has a perspective and a rigor and an energy that I wanted to emulate in my own writing and so Alex has been a huge inspiration for me has become a friend he's writing a book on sort of the interplay of scarcity and abundance and how technology sort of plays with that and he just wrote a book there an article called debt is coming which has gone absolutely viral and he is going to talk about that with us today so I'm gonna introduce Alex Alex give a quick background of yourself quick background of the article and then we'll roll and get into it sure that sounds great um hey everybody and thank you so much to David for the introduction it was funny I was thinking back when we the when we first met in person which is when I went on David's podcast I got an email sort of a long time ago from David you had found my personal email and sent me a things like hey would you like to come on my podcast and I remember at the time thinking like oh I should get around to doing that but it sort of got lost and missed all of the stuff that I was currently working on and then it finally came together and it was just one of the most engaging and fun and interesting times that I've ever had speed to somebody in an interview format before I thought okay this is definitely going somewhere I would love to do more stuff with David however as possible and so seeing rite of passage come together and seeing all you guys here listening to you know all of the really just first-class insights and advice that David has for all of you I'm just really overjoyed to be a part of it so this is just such a pleasure to be here to give you a little bit of background on myself I have had this very unusual career arc that doesn't really make sense to anybody except for there's been want this one common thread that's tied it all together which is writing basically everything good that has ever happened to me in my career has come because of writing online and mouthing off on the internet and just writing things down and provoking people to pay attention to it my background is in life sciences originally I was in grad school doing neuroscience research and then I fairly like several years ago and then I fairly quickly realized I didn't want to be doing that I wanted to go do something on my own and so I ended up starting a startup and that's how I got into the startup world and my I had started writing online my blog was how I found my co-founder for my first startup my blog was how I ended up writing something that got me noticed and ultimately brought into the venture capital world I worked at a venture capital firm called social capital for four years and they had found me through my online writing while I was there one of the things that I did there in addition to doing some early stage investing on a team called the discovery team was I also wrote the social capital newsletter just a lot of fun and since then over the past year I've been going out of my own and really really like going hard on my own newsletter and my own writing and a bunch of stuff I'm still doing some venture things on the side but mostly like the main thing that I'm doing though is writing so I'm I have a weekly newsletter that comes out on Sundays it's called Alex Danko's newsletter you can find it at Dan Cody subst a calm you know plug sub stack by the way that you what you should all be using for your online newsletters it's really good it's free it works it's the best and I'm also as David mentioned I'm doing an interesting experimental project I'm writing a book in a quasi public format I'm writing a book sort of like chapter by chapter and I'm putting together this first draft in half public I have it I have a group of people who pay $10 a month to subscribe to this little project and they get basically a first look at all of these drafts that I'm writing and these ideas that I'm putting together on an approximately weekly basis if any of you would like to join that I would love to have you unfortunately I can't make it free because I don't want the to be too too many people in here but if you'd like to join you can join at scarcity dot sub stack com so that's my one and only plug for the book project I'd love to see some of you in there if you'd like to participate that's me in a nutshell and I'm here to share for the next 55 minutes or so hopefully some some big perspectives and then some on-the-ground tactics for how to write better how to write faster how to write well so I'm all yours awesome well Alex would you rather talk about you wrote the five things let's just start off with one thing sort of and then we'll work down into the article that you just wrote can you talk the importance of taking notes like one of the things that both of us wholeheartedly agree upon is not to write with an empty page actually right from abundance instead of scarcity do you want to talk about that yeah absolutely so I can I can if I can hole up on the screen I'll do that in a second it is absolutely right in that one of the biggest challenges that people have with writing if they're especially starting out at the beginning of their writing careers or they don't write professionally or on a very regular basis is how to start writing is a little Reddy's a little bit like working out like when you're in the middle of a workout it's a lot easier to keep going than it is to start I'm cold and with writing is no exception I think people have the hardest time they're like okay I have something I want to talk about but I'm having a really hard time engaging like writing the first paragraph writing the first sentence writing the first articulation of what's important and so there are a lot of ways that you can get around this in terms of like how do you how do you sort of break the friction of starting with a blank page and the answer is never start with a blank page like David said it's like I don't care what you do write find some quotes that are related to what you're writing and paste them in one thing that I often do a lot with my newsletter is I will start with some tweets that people have made that are related to the topic and I will literally just take screenshots of them and drop them in my Evernote I will do that I'll show you some examples of this in a second I will write some scribble outlines off and on paper I will I'm a very visual thinker so I will make a lot of drawings right of the point that I'm trying to make or of any anything anything at all that is related to the logic of what I'm trying to communicate just draw it take a picture of it and then drag the picture into your Evernote doc or whatever you use to take notes rights like just start with something it doesn't matter what it is and it doesn't matter if it never makes it into the final version of grades like this is for you it's not for the final piece right it's just to help you get started why don't I actually share this screen hmm David can you I saw it David I sent you a link to this Evernote doc can you share it and bring it up yeah of course you email it to me yeah cool sorry about the technical difficulties guys dealing with it just while I get it up why don't you sort of unshare screen now um and I just dropped a quote in the chat that I'd love to hear your thoughts on one of the things that you said like a year and a half ago that I just sort of pulled up in my notes was that people overestimate how much return they'll get from running in the short term but they underestimate what they'll get in the long term and so a blog is sort of your brain evolving over time and the value is actually in the body of work that you've accumulated and what you say the maturity of thought that comes with it is has more valued than any one single piece of writing you want to talk about that yeah I think that's totally correct and I think it's corrected two levels the first level is external right like when people people always just a lot of time when people write something and there's they have some agenda with writing it like a lot of it is okay I want to get noticed by somebody in this field they're like I want to get people to agree with me on something they write it and they release it out into the world and then what happens is some people read it but not as many as you'd hoped and then three or four days later everybody has forgotten about it and you're bummed out right you're like man nobody read my piece right that's a shame like well keep doing that right because at some point what's gonna happen is as you write more and as people start to read your stuff a little bit more what's gonna happen is all of the body of work that you've already produced is going to be there for your readers to find and then for them to like browse around things you've written so it creates a depth to what you've produced in the creates a body of work that you're produced that is way way more valuable than any one piece alone right the compounded value of your writing is huge and you shouldn't underestimate it the second reason why it's important to have this big body of work is actually internal it's because the more you write the better your writing is going to get right this is just a fundamental fact of writing is the more the more you write the end the the faster you write and the more fluently right and the more just of a second nature it becomes the naturally better it's going to be right as you come up with it right it's there's a sort of a thing I think you've heard me say this before my favorite little parable about this is the pottery teacher story so you have a pottery teacher who has two students right and they both want to learn how to make clay pots so he goes to student 1 is this okay student 1 it's Monday your job by Friday is to try to create one perfect pot that's your job make one perfect pot then he goes to student two D says okay by Friday I want you to make as many pots as possible I don't care if they're any good you want to make you want to just mass produce a bunch of pots sudden the teacher leaves he comes back on Friday and what does he find it's like well not only has students who made a huge number of pots to the other students only one but every single pot is better than the first students attempt at a perfect pot right because the way that you learn how to make really good pots is just by make right it's not to try to study and agonize over how to make the one perfect thing it's just to mass-produce them right it's very very procedural stuff so the reason why I having this big body of work is valuable internally to you is because the more the more pots you've made the better any given one will be and the more you can sort of see the depth of what you've produced that contributes to your own thinking so that's why I highly recommend to people write a lot and keep all of it ideally if you can keep it all publicly so that other people can find it because you never know right what you've written a long time ago is gonna really be the thing that somebody was looking for right you never absolutely never know you have no idea absolutely I love that parable I just dropped the I just sort of a screenshot of the text from that if you want to just save it and and save it your own note take you file Alex I'm trying to find the thing that you sent me do you have a link that you can just drop in the chat that I can share my screen with yeah sure yeah okay one sec I work right - yeah this is right it's perfect okay so this topic of what are you know what are some tips and tactical things that I took notes for as I was writing this post last week thinking ahead and say you know I'm gonna be talking with David and a bunch of people for rite of passage so one of the things that wander I took care to write down was at the very beginning of this process what did it look like so here I can sort of show you this sort of like what does it look like at the very beginning so here are some of the notes that I took just right at the start you can see here this is a um this is a picture that I took up of notebook where I'm sort of scrolling down like okay here a couple of basic ideas here you know here a couple graphs if you can scroll down a little bit David you know here are some examples of like I'm trying to sketch out the main points that I'm trying to make this second page is something none of this ended up in the original in the final post like absolutely none of that ended up showing up it doesn't matter right this is just for you to start getting going if you can scroll down a little bit more to this next one you'll notice that this looks like something that you may notice if you read the post as one of the sort of diagrams in there this became my first anchor point that I tangibly started writing around right so this is what it originally looks like scrawled in some notebook just to give you a sense of like give yourself any kind of anchor to start writing from here David let me send you another let me send you another link to something great okay so why don't I walk you through what this looks like so here you can see so like at the very beginning is this screenshot of somebody who tweeted at me something in their inbox right which was related to something that I had tweeted out a week before right this is really just like a little note for me to be like hey what is it that we're talking about what gave me the original idea to write this piece and that was that somebody had tweeted this thing at a write about something called production capital which is one of the themes I talked about in this essay so one of the first things I do is I'll just slap this at the top of the Evernote document and sometimes it'll keep its way in there like very often I will publish things that like have these prompts in there at the very beginning like I'm a very fond of writing like here's a tweet that I noticed that made me think about something and then I'll just show it in this case it didn't stick make it into the final round I ended up deleting it because it wasn't necessary so it doesn't matter but it helped me get started right so that's what kind of counts here if when it keeps growing down here so this is the debt is coming so this is February 5th noon draft so if you look here at this says the deployment period let me give you my next sort of hint for like how to get started which is one of the big blocks that people have when they are sitting in front of a blank page you're sitting in front of a page with a little bit of notes so like okay what should I or start writing don't write the introduction to your essay first right you should leave that until last the first thing that you should start writing in my opinion in my experience is what feels like the most procedural and the most boring of the writing you're gonna have to do right it's like think about what approximately you're gonna have to say and be like okay is there any writing that I know and I could explain in my sleep and is like necessary background information for the reader that I want to communicate odds are there'll be something like this right right this first right there are two reasons to write it first the first reason to write it first is because it'll be the easiest thing for you to write right you should there should be something in this essay that you know pretty cold right that you can just be like okay after I have to write this down after spend as I can write this fairly quickly and you just write it as if I'm talking to somebody about it the second reason why you should start with what is just like really really familiar to you is because you may not realize it but this is probably gonna be the most important stuff in the entire essay there's a line that I've heard from David and somebody else I think which is the like look at your fish line dude can you actually say what that line isn't full like aunt remember it exactly I don't want to butcher it yeah I was worried I was a root it's so funny that you said that I actually recorded a three-minute podcast about this this morning about an hour ghost so like it is so top of mind I love this concept so basically there was a Harvard teacher and he was a writing teacher back in like the nineteenth century okay and on the very first day of class what he does is he takes a fish right so let's pretend it's like one of those Nemo fishes right it's like a size or hand and it's orange and white and he leaves the class and he tells all the students write about what you see and taste the fish out of the jar and puts it on the table he goes out and he comes back and he goes students what did you see and all the students are like what are you talking about you just put a fish on the table then you left nothing happened there's nothing to write about and he goes ah that's actually not true actually look at the fish so does this day after day after day and on the last day of the semester they have to like write an essay about what is on the table and so once again the teacher takes a fish out of the jar flicks it on the table and says write about what you see and all the students just produce essays they start talking about the way that the fins are resting on the table the way that the eyes pop out of the socket in the front of their head the way that the orange light actually reflects with the fluorescent lighting of the room and all of a sudden you have the exact same experience and in the course of a semester you go from well there's nothing to write about of oh my goodness there is so much to say and so David McCallum who's one of the top biographers for American history right above his desk he has a note to himself which says look at your fish the point being there is so much more information in the world than you're processing and you have to double look triple look quadruple look and look at your fish okay um yeah thanks for that story I think we're we're I think about the fish story especially in relation to start with what seems obvious to you is in start with what is right in front of you is the best essays that you guys are gonna produce are gonna be about topics that seem really obvious to you right but that may not be obvious to somebody else right it's like the most useful part of anything that you're writing and what ultimately becomes sort of the most interesting essays and the most interesting posts are not ones where you're gonna sit down and be like this is a big mystery and I have to logically think out what the answer is and be creative no it's just like talk about something that is super clear to you but that might not be necessarily clear to somebody else and you're gonna have to explain it just to get them onto the same page a lot of time just the act of doing that is gonna turn out to be this very very interesting set of information right that should honestly become the basis for your entire essay so this is why I recommend that people start with the portion of the essay that to you is gonna feel the most procedural in the most rote because it's probably going to be the most important part but it will also be the easiest for you to write so that's where you should start from and as you are writing it what often happens to me and may hopefully happen to you is you realize that this is something that you're good at writing about and you'll enjoy the process more right no one likes writing something that feels excruciatingly them to write but people like writing something where you feel like an expert at it you feel good at it because you know you feel you feel confident you feel familiar you feel that as if you're helping somebody just get on your level about something those tend to be the best posts so if you take something out of this like I really hope that that's it right is um not it like the entire essay doesn't have to be something that you know cold in fact writing about something is a great way to learn about new topics um but make sure that you at least have a foothold into some aspect of the world that you know very well right in fact you can sort of think of this as saying like every essay should have two components right there's your foothold that you know super well and there's where you're going to reach from that foothold which is an aspect of the world that you would like to learn a little bit about and want to use this writing as an excuse and an opportunity to go learn alright that's one way you can think about this but you have to have a foothold if you don't have a foothold then nothing's gonna work right you're gonna produce something that is going to be either wrong or trivial most of the time if you do have a foothold you can produce something that's correct right and that seems obvious to you but it's gonna be important it's gonna be helpful for people all right that's stuff that readers actually want to read where do you want me to go um how about this why don't we if you want to go through that amid that initial rough draft I can either walk through it and show you like examples of like how I was putting this together what I was thinking maybe we can do that but I might be too hard to do online one thing that I sort of prepare one like very tactical thing that I put together that's a real example from writing this was how to edit a sentence this is one of the most useful things buddy ever taught is writing ever while ago that okay so can you go back to the initial thing that I sent you the one has the pictures yeah and then scroll down are you seeing a strong senses this is sort of hopefully this will be a really tangible and tactical ways that you can improve some of you writing so some of the highest yield things that you can do is when you're in middle of your writing is to just tackle sentences one by one and turn week sentences into strong ones so this is a real example from the post that I just wrote is I'll show you a sentence that starts out quite large and quite flabby and that through progressive editing I got down to something very tight and pretty strong so the original sentence so the context here is I'm talking about this other book which is a book called technological revolutions and financial capital by Carlota Perez which is really a book I'm talking about this book in the introductory paragraphs of the essay and one point that I want to make is like oh this is really good book to read along with this companion book which is a book called doing capitalism and the innovation economy by Bill Janeway so I'll show you the original sentence here was it's a good book to read alongside Bill Janeway's doing capitalism which is probably the number one book that is most influenced my own thinking all right so you know there you go that's a sentence that's the kind of sentence that I could imagine myself speaking out loud it's a fine sentence to speak out loud but as a written sentence it's a bit large it's a bit verbose it could be tighter you know you look at this and you're like okay let's see if we can tune this up a little bit so let's look at edit number one right so edit number one is let's go look if there are any words that are actually just totally unnecessary because they clarify something that doesn't actually need any clarification alright so how about the word book right I say it's a good book to read alongside this other book everybody knows it's a book you don't need to specify that it's a book all right so let's let's try taking that out so let's take out the word book it's good to read alongside Bill Janeway's doing capitalism which is probably the number one book that has most influenced my own thinking okay good we took out a couple of words that's a little tighter what's the next step so let's say edit number two just say if you mean it you know say it so try to eliminate qualifiers and hesitations and hedges so this is something that people naturally do a lot in their writing to is you know you you say something and then you're like oh I want to create a comfortable amount of padding around that sentence just to make sure that you know nobody takes us out of context or gets mad at me for saying that so know if you mean something actually say it right if something is the most this say so if something absolutely is this then say so right so here you know I had said like it's good to read alongside build genuine book number one book that's most influenced my own thinking no let's get rid of the witches probably right I don't need to say that it's probably the number one book this influenced my thinking no if you mean it say it let's get rid of it the nice thing about this by the way as the happy anecdote is that bill personally emailed me afterwards to say thank you and I've never actually spoken with him before so that was really delightful right the essay found its way to him and he reached out and said hey I was thanks for signing my stuff this is really great you know I'd love to get connected so hey you know right super cool very cool right is really exciting so like if you mean it say it because you never know what kind of good thing may happen from you actually being directed by looking in so that's cool so let's take out this probably stuff so now let's see it's good to read alongside bill Janeway's doing capitalism the number one book that has most influenced my own thinking ok we're getting somewhere let's see if we can take out some more words so here we can say this like the my own thinking that still seems like it is too many words right let's try taking out number one right you're already saying it's most influenced your own thinking you know need to say it's the number one thing that's most influenced my thinking that's redundant let's take that out now we have it's good to read alongside bill chain which is doing capitalism the book that is most influenced my own thinking better right there's still one major thing that we can do and this is a hard one but it's a realist one that'll really really pay dividends which is whenever possible get rid of any verb construction that uses the verb to be in any form this is something this was something right it is good to do something and replace it with an active verb that's gonna be much stronger so when I was in 11th grade English I had a writing teacher named Miss page who made us do this writing exercise which is in any given paper we were not allowed to use the verb to be at all ever we maybe we could use it like five times or something like we had to pick them wisely and then every time we used it over our limit we got docked a point right for every single time so it forces you to really think do I absolutely have to use a weaker verb construction right could you use an active verb directly right it's a fantastic writing exercise is hard it really uses your brain but it makes your writing so much better so let's look at this example it's good to read alongside Bill Janeway's doing capitalism well what am i trying to say it sounds like if I'm saying it's good for you to read this book it sounds like I want for you to read the book is there a more direct way I can say that yeah I can just say read the book right read it alongside Bill Janeway's doing capitalism a book that is most influenced my own thinking there we go like that's a better sentence right like you could probably even keep going more right like the end of the Sun still may have an extra word or something but like I don't know I'm pretty happy with this sentence I think we can leave it here so let's compare right at the beginning in the end you can scroll back up right so the initially liked the sentence we had it's a good book to read alongside bill Janeway is doing capitalism which is most influenced my own thinking now let's go to the bottom we have read it alongside bill Janeway is doing capitalism the book that has most influenced my own thinking what better sentence right what a much better business right so you don't have to go through your essays and systematically like pare down all of the fat off of every sentence that's a little bit aggressive like it's good to have some sentences that are a little bit unnecessarily verbose or have a little bit of sentences that are padding that's fine it's like a steak you know you want there to be a little bit of marbling it doesn't need to be completely like lean meat but you don't want too much right like it's a good exercise to go through and [ __ ] you know find the sentences in your writing that are unnecessarily flabby and just try to go through the exercise of tightening em up it's a very good editing exercise it'll force you to confront what you're actually trying to say especially the exercise of forcing yourself to use active verbs I find is a really good way of forcing people to get to the point of what they're saying it also sort of echoes back to a point that David has said a bunch of times that I really like which is vary the lengths of your sentences it's really nice writing reads much better when sentences are of different lengths and you can use this as a method to really try to pare down some of them and then leave others be a little bit lighter and longer all right let there be some variety but in order to in order to have variety you have to have the ability to pare them down when necessary right you have to have mastered your own writing enough to be able to shorten it if you want to right that is really an essential exercise to go through I have a couple questions do you think that I guess my big one here is there are always exceptions to things so you mentioned say what you mean but then you get those people who respond and they say well Oh have you thought about this one exception and so as a result there's always a temptation to use words like probably or mostly but they dilute the quality of your writing so when you say say what you mean and you say debt is coming other people might say well it's already here or it's actually not fully coming and they'll sort of try to pick out nuance which yes they might be technically right but it actually is really bad writing how would you think about that trade-off uh well the first thing about the trade-off is don't worry about like if you're trying to write an essay and the point of the essay is to create a stake in the ground around some point that you want to establish if you want people to read your writing you know create sides and then force people to take one mmm force people to take aside and understand what the other side of the point you're saying is right if you are writing something and you cannot think of any possible reason that you are wrong or you cannot think of any way that somebody might disagree with you then either you don't understand what you're talking about well enough or you're talking about something that's not that interesting maybe right this may not necessarily be the case for a lot of writing like there may if you're if you are just purely writing for a description or if you are purely telling a story of what happens with what you're doing is strictly observational writing then this may not always be true but if what you're trying to do is establish a stake in the ground around a point and get it Russians start off starting then honestly the best advice you can follow is create sides and force people to take one you can take your side or you can take the other side either is fine right once you are in this mindset of course you're gonna eliminate every kind of word like maybe or probably or perhaps or whatever now there's no there's no room for that right create some controversy right it'll do you some good you I remember when we spoke a couple months ago you said that your limit is like 5,000 words per week which is really impressive how is it that you're able to cultivate those ideas and begin to stir on them week after week what are you doing like for me one thing that is absolutely irreplaceable is just having conversations with really smart people if I'm just thinking to myself I can't actually get the ideas out of my brain and make them concrete for you I know that you like to run what are the other things that are really helpful for you because your cadence and pace of output is about as high as anyone I know um that's a good question well let's think about this like how long did it take me to write the dead piece so it's it's about 3,000 words and I would think like it took me four years to think about in the two days to write which is gonna be the case for a lot of this stuff right it's like you accumulate a lot of this knowledge in your point of view over a very long time but then once you have that you should hopefully be able to write this stuff fairly quickly if you are in practice this stuff I don't know I think I wrote the first in if I'm if I'm actually writing for a good chunk of the day I can put out 2,000 words in a day and this is not actually writing fast like this is a lot of people are like 2,000 words in a day like that's so fast it's actually not like if you're actually just writing like directly straight through a train of [ __ ] you can write 500 words in a matter of minutes if you're just writing your stream of consciousness right the key to writing fast is to having your stream of consciousness be good writing which is something that only comes true the more you right the more you write the just like the less you are gonna have to work to make what just sort of automatically comes out of your writing be a plausible first draft of stuff that's really interesting Arabic bird Doris output and wrote one time where he said that the best way to become a better speaker is to write about the thing that you're speaking about and so then once you actually speak you are actually just saying going from the structure of what you've already written but you're going a step farther you're basically saying there when do you write you learn to think logically and structure your ideas in a way that then you can speak about it better but not just that your actual state of conscious processing is already being dictated by the logic that writing demands I've never thought of that before it's really interesting that's right and I mean I would even think of that in a level that is dumber than the like organizational logic of the point you're trying to make I just mean like can you speak in complete sentences that are like good English right it's not even like oh can you put advanced thoughts together and like logically arranged paragraphs no it's just literally like can you like output something just like we're not even thinking about it like writing on your keyboard and then look at it and have this be like okay that's like not the greatest writing but like it's a plausible first draft all right so one suggestion that I have for people is read your own writing and read it a lot I probably spend at least an hour a week reading my own writing and it's not just vanity like there's actually a point to this which is the way that you become a better writer is by reading lots of writing right it's like this is why you should read books right this is why you should read anything right as you sort of absorb the sentence construction and the themes and the idioms and just the the the writing voice and cadence of what you're reading right so it's like naturally this makes sense that you should read people who are good writers but why read your own writing it's like well the style that's most important for you to master is your own right if you can master your own style and work on that and spend 80% of your time at least working on your strengths then writing and sounding like you will be easier and easier for you to do right there's not much point for like I don't know like reading a bunch of Hemingway and then being like I'm gonna write like Hemingway it's like that's fine if what you're trying to do is like imitate him for the purpose of some essay but well you actually want to do is write like yourself right so the way that you learn how to more frictionlessly write like yourself is to read yourself right just read yourself a lot right you'll have to read it critically like you don't have to go in and look and what I've just really passively can be something that you do when you're like on the subway or like you have your phone or you're waiting in line to grocery store is like go read through a little bit of your old writing it may not seem like it's doing anything but I promise you it's one of the best ways to compound your own writing proficiency right every time you do it it makes your writing like 1% less hard and that pays you enormous benefits over time interesting can you walk me through the process of like so you're scrolling Twitter you're having a conversation and what does it look like free charts that you showed us before once you have the Epiphany do you go you write about it right away you try to think of it over time how does that actually look and when do you know you have to have one of these every single week when do you know ha I caught my fish I now know to reel it in rather than you know what this is just a six-inch fish and I'm looking for a 16 inch fish this week so that's okay I'm glad you brought that up because I would say only 50% of the time at most do I have one of those clued and movement moments at the beginning where like okay I know the point I'm trying to make half of the time at most right I would say 50% of the time it's actually like oh crap I gotta write a newsletter this week and I have no idea what I'm gonna say what is something that I can plausibly start with and then as I write figure out something that's interesting to say write some of my favorite essays have been points that are completely not something that I set out trying to write about right but it's the process of writing that gets you thinking like oh maybe my original point actually wasn't that interesting oh maybe this original thesis that I had is in fact totally wrong and I just didn't really understand the issue but as you write unless you learn about what you're writing about you realize oh but there's this other point that I could make so it's say only 50% of the time or so do I'd like know ahead of time what I'm gonna write about but I'm glad you mentioned Twitter because Twitter is just an evergreen source of ideas for things to write about because you know when you used it I don't know how many of you what percentage of you use Twitter but when you're on Twitter you can get a sense for what people are talking about and what the shape of the arguments are around that thing and especially like if you if you're clued into this and you pay attention you can get a sense for what is the white space that is remaining for people to say something interesting so if you notice that everybody seems to be dancing around some issue but nobody has ever like come out and said it like hey maybe that's a really good opening for you to go out and say it right go do your reading like do your homework and make sure you're not totally talking out of your ass right but then go see it right go to decide like okay in one week I'm gonna write an essay about this right I have to go figure it out and I have to go write it right like having a deadline the basically saying like okay well I need to produce something by this certain date I better go learn about this right I better go browse around and see what people are talking about or maybe you go back and read some source material or whatever I don't care how you do it but the minute that you realize here is something that I'm going to need to learn about by this certain deadline there's a great way to force yourself to get into the mode of shipping something all the time right what do you get something on a regular basis that's the most important habit you can develop exactly I want to just reiterate that ship something on a regular basis that is the most important habit you can develop I couldn't agree more that is like in rite-of-passage we say you have to publish something every single week because it's just like working out where once you actually get that habit and you are shipping over and over and over you begin to see these positive benefits and the scale sort of tips where it becomes a habit and the gravity kind of flows with you actually being able to produce consistently and I couldn't agree more though the most important place to get in the entire writing process is getting to a point where your shipping consistently on that one thing that you do Alex like I can think of your hot and cold audio you went back research McLuhan there's been many times we've gone back research biology you've gone back readers Gerard now colada prose Carlota Perez this week what is your research process making sure that you both get deep enough to actually understand an idea but also not stuck in an idea where then you're like oh my goodness I need to read more read more read more because you're never going to be entirely satisfied with your knowledge and how do you not get trapped in research that's a good question um so again I would say like about so this is gonna be about 50/50 like about I would say about half of the time like for example like this like this week I'm writing about or this past week you know read about Carlota Perez write about a technological revolutions financial capital I did not go back and read that book I already know that book pretty cold right I've already read that book a bunch of times like I did not have to go back and be like oh what did she say again like I know that stuff pretty well other times like with McLuhan I absolutely had to go back and read it because I could not remember anything that that books that it's like I'm just like okay I had to actually go find my copy of understanding media and like actually go back and read and just be like I am so out of my depth here let me just make sure that I have something that I can grab onto that understand and in that particular situation right what I could grab onto and understand was you know I don't really know anything about Media Studies I had read this book and I sort of tried to understand that and try to fill it in with what my experience was but I do have a neuroscience graduate degree right I do have a fairly good understanding of what is the like the neurological processing that's going on that is the underpinning behind this so I had that as my anchor write it to sort of pivot around and so I used that in the process of the audio revolution right I used my understanding of neurobiology as this sort of starting point and then say okay right I can now go explore in this nebulous world of communications theory I don't know anything about to research knowing that I have some sort of place of strength that I can fall back to right so that's a great sort of general general pattern that I would say echo back to before is if you're going and doing some as you call research about something make sure that there is at least some strong connection to something that you know right if there's no connection to anything that you know then maybe wait until writing about it until you figure out something that there is and write about something else right I don't know it's like but always write so that there is some sort of place that you can stand on confidently is really I think a strong recommendation that I would urge tell me so when you now are writing like there's sort of two very different kinds of writing I think what we've been talking a lot about is the kind of writing of going to look for new ideas I'm gonna write something new this week but with scarcity in the software century the the book that you're working on it is different it is one theme that you're writing about for 52 weeks in a row how is that process of digesting the same general idea but almost through a kaleidoscopic lens of seeing it from a slightly different twist every week how is that different for you okay that's gonna be way more than 52 weeks I'm not I'm not half done are you kidding so scarcity the software centuries again this is the the book that I'm writing this has been this interesting experiment for me because I've never written a book before right I don't really know how to go about doing this and it's been much harder right it's been way way harder to actually produce something in this much broader theme and also shipping something week by week that is consistent so something that I've learned to accept in this process is that I'm gonna throw out a lot of the writing that I'm producing and I'm gonna repurpose a lot of it in ways that I did not originally intend the goal is to sort of figure out what this arc that you're building as you're doing it right so that's been really interesting is something that I've been learning along as I go through this one of the sort of decisions that I made a couple months ago as I'm doing this is that so I don't want this to look like a totally traditional book in the sense that I want people to read it more like an encyclopedia than a book so I'd like there to be like one sort of narrative that goes from front to back but I want people to read it not necessarily in order I want there to be lots of sort of pop out examples of text so like examples from what I'm talk like I'm basically want the book to read is that there's a consistent text that is basically a set of ideas and some theory and some big basic concepts and then you're like okay show us some examples to have the example rather than being woven into the text in a way that's hard to find and hard to locate just be in a little box that's popped out to itself right or to have like oh what is some like further reading or what is some like a tangent do you want Oh have that be in a little box or whatever so this has been fun for me to write because it's really transformed the writing process for me in that it has freed me from the burden of having to write something that is simultaneously in the right order and making the point that I want to make and richly filled with enough examples and the right examples that I want to have and something that I actually write in the order that it will ultimately go in the book which is almost impossible right over something that's up that life so I realized that this was a constraint that I did not actually have to have right and so I just decided I'm gonna free myself of this constraint and then that actually has made my life a lot easier right so like that's the sort of a general hint which is that if you can identify some constraint that's giving you a hard time and then you have the option of just getting rid of it then do that right that's like if something is if something is causing friction for you and you have the option of getting rid of it then just get rid of it right tell you have you did it one one final question before we as we begin to wrap up one of the things that I think that anyone who reads your work regularly will say is Alex's writing is always interesting and you talked a little bit about navigating the space the shape of the argument I like that and then also all your right definitely has those two sides where when I read it there's always well there's what these people think and then there's what these people think what else do you think contributes to interestingness in a piece of writing what do you think those core tenants are um so no question I you know I wish I knew the magic formula if there is please tell me yeah I would say that I would just reiterate again there's no formula for like really good writing but the closest thing that I can come to it is again like create sides and force people to take one it doesn't have to be yours right it's like be it like okay here's it here's a way to think about this um so I don't know how many of you watch Pro Wrestling at all but in Pro Wrestling you have the concept of the heel and the face right you have a bad guy you have the good guy and there's a concept in wrestling and also in narrative generally which is called the heel makes the face right the villain makes the hero right this is a general principle of storytelling is that just a hero on their own is almost valueless as a source of narrative there has to be a villain next to which the hero is defined right so you see people who are very very effective at telling stories and very effective at persuasion and very effective at getting you to think their way are often masters of this right they will help shape your argument in terms of what its opposite is and when you're writing something and if you are trying to create sides and forcing people to take one let your right be comfortable with the fact that some people may read your writing and identify with it as the hero and other people may read that very exact same piece of writing and identify it as the villain right be comfortable with that right if you're willing to let people strongly disagree with you but then have other people strongly agree with you then it means you're writing about something that matters right which is honestly kind of the most important thing right if you're writing about something that matters and if you're writing it about something in a way that forces people to confront something about it then you're probably on the right track with something yeah absolutely you know it's funny because I read a lot of student writing and it'll say things like heart like the central thesis will be hard work is good and one of the things that you said earlier is what good writing has to have is an opposite and it can't just be something that's like cliche or tautology like everyone would agree that broadly hard work is good so that's not a good way to go where's a couple weeks ago I saw something really interesting where Michael Nielson went out and said actually maybe people are in flow states too much because if you're working in a flow state that might be something that you should be delegating and actually really smart people should be working in flow states less and I like that because broadly people just say hey spend more time in flow States that's what everybody says and Michael comes out and sort of says the opposite and I think that that tension that pulled between the two sides is what creates the interestingness and you always want to think when you write a sentence is there a way that this isn't true because those are the good sense and says when you're trying to go up prove something and there's that opposite side um yeah and in fact I would even go a step further than that into the realm of the slightly risky and say the length of the dynamic through which you should think about your writing isn't true versus false it's hero versus villain complicated thing right like there can be many different versions of the truth for different people with different points of view and if you're talking about something that is really important then maybe there isn't necessarily one obvious truth and it's consensus right instead of thinking of like how am I gonna write about this whether this is truth but like the opposite of it might be false think how am i writing about something in a way where I know who the villain is I know who the hero is at the point I'm trying to make so to give you let me give you a concrete example and you talk about this dead article that road sose article that over the last week that has half of people ecstatic and half of people furious which is a sign that you're on the right track is an article that is talking about the way that we fund in Silicon Valley versus the way that a lot of businesses are funded in the rest of the world which is funding them with equity versus funding them with debt respectively and Silicon Valley is this place that is sort of created we've gotten very very good at growing startups in one very particular way which is funding them all with equity right funding them all through taking ownership stakes in these companies at these ever-growing valuations and it works very particular for growing a company that does one thing which is either grow incredibly fast or die trying right it's really good at this one thing and the sort of Silicon Valley elites you know like the venture capitalists and the founders who have gotten very good at this have constructed this world in which they've gotten very good at it and they're the heroes of this world because they produce a certain kind of output the debt piece basically took all of that and described it as it is and then cast them as villains rather than heroes right and this was very effective for a couple ways right there is a very clearly defined villain and it and conversely a really well defined hero who could be defined bad who could be understood with reference to that villain it got a lot of people it like it compelled people to read the thing because now the of this group of people that they know very well are being cast in a villainous light right which is like oh my god I have to read this right it creates urgency for why you should read this and it created a starting point for a lot of very I don't know emotional and urgent dialogue around the block right because from the very beginning there's a good understanding of who the villain of the piece was right you don't even need to know who the hero of the piece is if you know who the villain of the piece is then you're off to a good start mm-hmm very Girardi interview we don't even know what we're going for we're just we know who the scapegoat is and we're gonna be against them well a villain and a scapegoat are the same thing at all I would say if there could be there can also be a scapegoat of something but if you understand like yeah it's like if you if you understood I would say like if you understand what the who is butting heads about this and then you can understand like what the sort of weird side tangents the people will go on in order to try to find something to either bury a hat chaton or to try to find common ground or to find try and find new frontiers argue better whatever then that means you actually understand the landscape of what you're writing about pretty well so yeah I would think that instead of trying to think about it like in like a Girard context or whatever imagine it's pro wrestling right imagine if what you're writing is WWE right imagine if what you're writing is something that Vince McMahon has to come out and trump up on stage right and I bet you it'll be a shortcut towards writing really good stuff awesome well I I thank you so much for sharing with us really like seeing how you went through the sentences this idea of casting the villain I've never thought of before and is there anything else that you think before we head out that thing is that you need to tell people who write if you knew this you would be so much more productive and your writing would be better I'll leave you with one little writing hack that I use myself that is useful for me to get over a sort of the the anxiety barrier of publishing publicly so a lot of people me included sometimes right a lot of people where they've written something they're like okay maybe I think this is pretty good they get a lot of anxiety around hitting post right around hitting published somewhere public right because it's a big thing right it's a big thing to actually commit your writing to the harsh light of the outside world right it's something that makes people uncomfortable it makes people 'angels so what I recommend doing is like find some tricks or hacks for how to make this easier for you and I'll share you one that I do myself which is when I write my writing the process that I go is as follows is the first thing that I do is I will publish it online but in a place that will not get a lot of reads directly right I'll place it on my own personal website which is alex van cocom which is where I put all my writing but if all you do is post it there and that's it nobody's gonna read it right if you don't distribute your writing it's not gonna get read by anybody right you have like distribution is more is the most important thing if you don't have distribution on you might as well be like throwing it in a paper airplane out the street right it's not gonna get read by anybody but you can use this to your advantage right what I do is on Thursday or Friday night or something I'll post it publicly on Alex Danko calm right and then I'll just leave it there then I'll look at in the morning I'll sleep on it I'll maybe do some editing maybe a handful of people will have read it and engaged it with it or comment on it and then I will actually just fully may get it right depending I will just shamelessly edit the thing that has already been published but not yet distributed right and then once I've gotten over that a little bit then I will you know I will tweet it out and then I'll get people thinking about it and then most importantly I'll send it in the newsletter on Sunday morning right one of the best things you can acquire is an email distribution list it goes directly to people it's a fantastic way to distribute things that's much much stronger than social media I know David you've talked about this a lot so I don't need to cover this anymore but like get an email list absolutely but just to sort of to rephrase this trick though is break up the stages of posting things publicly in order to make any one step not that anxiety-inducing right is a great little trick and it'll probably help you get sort of familiar with this rhythm right it helps to have a little rhythm that you can do every week so that's what I do so I'll leave you with that trick do anything that is necessary to get over the anxiety barrier and get over that initial friction of posting your thing publicly you have to do it so find whatever way works for you and then just do that that's the message right that's the take-home message fantastic well for all of you if you want to have conversations like this for five weeks and actually learn how to write clearly and consistently build your email list build your site do all of this I have seen hundreds of people who heard people like Alex said I can't do this and there's actually a lot of alums here right now who they've been surprised by their own results in rite-of-passage I'm telling you it is unlike any other community out there and you can absolutely do this so don't let this be something that oh this is something for Alex not for me that's not the case at all and thank you all so much for being here thank you Alex and I mean this is a great thing to do so I'm thrilled to see so many people joining it's just absolutely great let me leave you with one final thought which is some kind of dataset a lot and I think is just absolutely true the returns to writing online in right now February 2020 have never been higher and are only going to get even better right now is the time to do this right like like I said it's beginning every good thing that has ever happened to me in my career I'm not joking has come from writing online you guys should do it too everybody should do this just right amen thank you very much hey buddy thanks for joining
