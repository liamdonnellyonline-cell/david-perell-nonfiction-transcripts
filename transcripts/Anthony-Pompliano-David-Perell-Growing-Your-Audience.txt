then I want to introduce Anthony Papa Leon Oh so why don't we better known as pomp so he is somebody who I think has cracked the code on building online audiences as well as anybody I know right now and the first time we met was in New York City I was just starting a podcast we met at a Starbucks on the east side and I was starting a podcast and I said hey how the hell do I do this I have no idea what I'm doing and I'd love your advice on what to do so we sat down we had a notebook I remember flip flipping to like the fortieth page we had a notebook and we drew out the entire model of what the podcast was going to be I thought he was helping me little did I know he was showing me exactly how he thought about audience building in just an amazing one-hour session and then we recorded a podcast a couple months ago we said oh my goodness we have so many things in common and I invited him here today to deliver this session on how to build an online audience welcome pomp thanks for having me man I'm super excited about this great so I'm gonna get the slides up for you now and then we can sort of go through it at a similar speed and let's see how this goes so present how does that look I can see it I don't know if other people can but looks good enough all right so how to build an audience and create content in 2020 punk why don't you introduce yourself for serve so Anthony papiano most people just call me pomp I currently run a asset management firm with two of the partners we manage about 150 million dollars and through either luck skill or some combination I've probably built one of the largest individual media companies in technology and Finance previously did a whole bunch of other stuff and we can get into kind of how the work at Facebook snapchat etc was a super helpful in helping me understand how platforms work and how different growth models would work fantastic and so what what we've built so far we've got a number of different platforms number of different kind of media assets if you will we do over 60 million impressions per month across those platforms the business is highly profitable we've never raised an outside dollar and there's literally three people including myself that run this so the big thing I think is that at this point given the tools that are available in the platform's you don't need a lot of people and you can build incredible reach audience and monetization just using kind of the tools that every other person has available to them you know and don't have to go work at a large technology company so I'll just kind of go through the the kind of more noteworthy things here so pop podcast basically we do five interviews per week top names business technology finance it started out under a different name called off the chain it was very focused on Bitcoin and crypto but we eventually went ahead and widened it out I joke and say this is the most selfish thing I do because it's just based on my personal interest it's a top ten podcast in various categories different countries and does about 2.5 million downloads and views a month that's across both two audio platforms and YouTube and then I basically record all of the conversations and then I've got one guy who helps me with some editing and we basically split it up so I had it probably about half the episodes he had it's the the other half of them the letter I basically write a letter every weekday set it out in the morning one of them is free to anyone on the email list four of them are behind a paywall so you pay to get kind of five days a week it's my personal opinion and analysis on business tech and finance there's over fifty thousand free subscribers and I basically write this myself each morning there's one section that I get somebody to help me on my much more intelligent than me wife writes a little piece of it each morning but for the most part I put together the rest myself and then lunch money is is the latest thing that we've done it's a daily show on YouTube it's about 20 minutes or less it essentially covers recent some news across business tech finance and culture does about a quarter of a million views per month the show is only about I'd say two months old or so and Flynn and I host it and then we've got one person who helps on the editing kind of post recording to help get it uploaded so I think that the kind of three things are podcasts the email and then and then lunch money are really that the show's media assets that we've built so far and then it's all driven by Twitter I've got over three hundred thirty thousand followers tens of millions of impressions per month a single tweet can drive you know thousands of clicks and the way that I think about this is everything starts and ends with Twitter it's really a traffic engine to all the other products and platforms we can get into kind of why that is and how I built it but I think that's the key to all this is having that Twitter account is a huge advantage yeah so I just want to sort of pause here and have like let me just sort of share my model of what's happening so basically what I see is there is a constellation of stars rotating around a central orbit which is Twitter so it is both a constellation within different ways of actually sharing media and delivering that so a podcast video newsletter all that sort of stuff and a different constellation of themes and people that he brings in so what you could think about is what the podcast is doing is you could think of that as sort of at the furthest frontier of how I would see Pomp's life people like Mark Cuban people investors like Chama the poly Hypatia really high-level guests that kind of come into the ecosystem now that then gets new people into the ecosystem and they can join the pomp letter they can watch pompon video they can read his writing all that sort of stuff and what we end up getting here is Twitter becomes that central hub and it is the orbit that everything funnels into and so what you're seeing here that I think is really interesting is you're seeing different ways different languages so to speak of engaging with your audience and that is the the the strategy behind this is what we're gonna get into today sure yeah I mean looked at this whole thing David and I talked about this years ago and I've been saying it for a long time it's just audiences the new currency and I'll get into kind of the timeline of how I built this but really it was this single five-word sentence drove it all it was just this idea that those who build the audience have the power and and so I set out to do that back in 2017 those who build the audience have the power I love that let's let's let's definitely explore that later on for sure and so just from a timeline standpoint I think part of this is people see this and like oh I'm gonna go do this tomorrow I've been doing this for a while so in Twitter in early 2017 literally planta had more followers than I had I think I had like 2,000 followers on Twitter hadn't really used it that much and I decided that was the platform where I was gonna build the audience first I thought it was the easiest one to kind of hack and really grow grew it in 2017 to a hundred thousand users or followers and then in May of 18 so about kind of just under 18 months after I started on Twitter I then started sub stack I was one of their first users there I wrote pretty much every single day until August 2018 when I launched the podcast and then it weighted all the way until January of this year before I really started focusing on YouTube and so we can get into kind of the logic behind this timeline but you can see that you know it's not something where I went and did everything all at once it was very kind of sequential and somewhat intentional and then kind of explain why I did it that way yeah how can you do this I'm assuming that's why you guys are all here best piece of advice don't try it it sucks to be completely honest and I'll kind of elaborate on this later but essentially this is really really hard and I put literally put this in here to remind myself like it's very easy to have kind of hindsight bias and be like oh yeah I just did this this this and then like it just happened but what you end up realizing is it's actually taking a lot of time a lot of effort I've probably done a lot of things that most people want or unwilling to do or - are very unscalable and so I think that you've got to have a more understanding of like why do I want to go do this what what is the value that I'm trying to create - what is the end result that I'm looking for like what does success look like and the third thing is you gotta have like an honest conversation with yourself just around do I have the time and energy and really dedication to attempt this and what I tell people is if you can talk yourself out of doing it before you even start what you never would have been successful with it anyways because it really is going to come down to just man-hours and time which obviously I've been blessed to be able to dedicate to it but but some people just you know for whatever reason they just can't do that and so speaking of that I've put together six principles in this deck that I'll go over kind of one-by-one David I can talk about and then at the end there's a number of actionable tips for each platform that are more tactical and exactly what you can do to to grow those platforms but by far when I sat down and thought about like what is the number one principle when thinking of all this it's just that persistence wins and what I mean by that is if you think that you're gonna launch any platform and build an audience from zero to you know a thousand users ten thousand a hundred thousand it just doesn't happen that way like literally I could tell you me to take YouTube for example when we got started we were getting like five subscribers a day and I was so frustrated and then all of a sudden we were getting a hundred and then 500 and then there was days we would get 2,000 subscribers in a day and you start to remember what you think like it's easy right and then all of a sudden it tapers off and then you're back down to getting 500 300 100 subscribers per day and you just got to remember that like the grind of this and in the persistence it just takes time and so that's not only true for me I think if you look at somebody like you know a mr. beast or a david dobrik like even people who have these really really big kind of tens of millions of people like I think it's mr. beast has been uploading videos to YouTube since 2013 right and so he's literally been doing it for seven years like no wonder he's good at it right and so I think the same thing here is when I talk about a lot of this stuff it's just I've been doing it for a long time at this point and I've actually tried all the things that didn't work and was just persistent enough to continue and so you know as you keep in mind that it's going to take time it also helps you mentally kind of continue because you're just say look of course it's gonna take a while you don't get frustrated when all of a sudden you don't get thousands or tens of thousands of followers or audience or subscribers and so the second principle and this is I think the biggest divergence that I've had from kind of mainstream thinking is somewhat up as productize yourself so I literally look at the hours in my day if we go to let's say this past Tuesday is a great example on Tuesday alone of this week I wrote a newsletter that I sent out to much people I then recorded lunch money which is the YouTube show I then did a live stream for somebody else's YouTube for an hour and then I recorded three podcast and so if you think about that I basically recorded five different video and audio assets and also wrote the email all in a single day and so that level of kind of effort one just most people don't have the capacity of work like that so I knew that that is an advantage I have and I try to lean into that but the second thing is the reason why I'm willing to do it is I basically break up my day and I say every hour is something I can dedicate to a different product so it takes me about one hour to write the email every day it takes me about 30 minutes to record lunch money every day it takes me about an hour to record a podcast and I literally just break up my day and then what I try to do is optimize every single hour how am i dedicating time to the production of a asset that then can be monetized later on and so when you think of it as a product standpoint the quote unquote investment you are making right I never raised money for this frankly I've sunk very little capital into it at all it was really just the the kind of time and effort of myself a few other people it was how are you going to spend your time right just like a business thinks of investing dollars and what is the output of that here what I thought about was as I invest my time what is the output and what I basically want to do is I want to optimize for every hour invested the most amount of content that I can create and that's what I've done income this idea of productizing yourself or productizing your ideas an important principle I have a question I would just want to jump in here how do you think of the leverage on your time so a word that we use internally is return on attention so in finance people talk about return on your investment for every dollar that you put in what kind of return are you going to get on that so the stock market will yield some kind of return maybe at around 7% the bond market might be down around two and obviously that fluctuates with interest rates and stuff like that but then when it comes to return on attention you are investing that same kind of time and giving your attention to a certain kind of product so when you're thinking about how am I going to invest my time sort of implied within what you're saying is I'm going to create as much as possible why was creating as much as possible your strategy rather than saying you know what I'm gonna write four books a year I'm gonna write 16 long-form essays why is it that you've gone for being prolific yeah so I think that and it's one of the other principles here like there's two paths you can pursue you can either put a bunch of time and attention into the highest quality low frequency type content which is people you're talking about or you can go the opposite end which is you can go to high frequency good enough quality right and the reason why I optimized for that is I previously ran the growth team for face book pages and so I got kind of an inside look at how a lot of these algorithms work and if you think of let's take Facebook's a newsfeed for example if you and a hundred other businesses are competing for the 7 to 12 commercial content slots every time the newsfeed is refreshed if that algorithm only has one piece of content from you to put into one of those slots you and every other business created one piece of content let's lay there's 100 businesses you have a 1 out of 100 chance of being included in those 7 to 12 slots if instead you have created 10 pieces of content and everyone else has created one you now have basically a 1 in 109 or I'm sorry you have a 10 out of a hundred chance of being included and so it isn't broken down by the number of people competing or the number of organizations it's actually the algorithms are optimizing for the number of pieces of content and so the more content you give the algorithm the more supply it has to choose from you have a higher odds of being included in the newsletter or in the news feeds and in the algorithms and so that was a very conscious decision because I understood how those social media algorithms worked that I said I can't predict it right I mean anyone who creates content on the Internet will tell you I kind of sort of know what's gonna take off but I've done interviews where I thought that they were Grand Slams and they absolutely kind of flop and then I've done ones that I would have thought they were gonna flop and they see you know they explode and so there's not as much ability to kind of predict some of this and so instead of trying to be perfect it's look let's get as many shots on goal as we can as long as it meets some quality barrier right you don't want to just throw kind of garbage at the wall but you want to meet some kind of quality bit bar and then as much of that as you can and it gives you the best opportunity to go viral create audience get in front of people things like that let's talk about focusing on one platform at a time principle number three yeah so this is basically how I built this is probably the number one thing that I did that a lot of people do the opposite right so literally I started on Twitter and 17 I did the newsletter I literally waited almost 18 months before I ever went to a different platform which was substandard it was actually had a fear of losing the first platform so I literally made a conscious effort I said if I ever lost a Twitter account for whatever reason if Twitter you know blew up tomorrow I wouldn't have any other platform and so I started to use Twitter to drive traffic to the newsletter as I built that up I then realized okay I should build out another platform which was the podcast and so for a good year and a half almost I only did Twitter then I saw the newsletter and once I had the podcast I basically pause right and I just did the news let the podcast in the email for 18 months I didn't go to another platform I didn't start a tick-tock or you know chase the latest greatest thing I didn't even really use Instagram or any that stuff it was just those are my three platforms and I'm gonna just do it until I feel really comfortable that in my sleep I could create content and grow on these platforms and then only then did I then say okay what's the fourth platform we chose YouTube and then we started to go there and so this idea of kind of focusing on one platform at a time has two main benefits the first is focus so you literally can focus on how do I win on this platform how do I become successful here but the second thing that it does is if you are able to grow the first platform it helps you accelerate the growth of the second platform then which of the second platform in a spot where you've built an audience and there's a high engagement all the things you want to see then when you go to build the third one you almost get the benefit of the first and second platform right because you can push people from those platforms to your third platform and things like that I think what a lot of people do is they go out and they say hey I need a Facebook I need an Instagram I need a tick talking into youtube I need all this stuff they end up doing none of them well one and then two is they've got a little bit of following on each individual one of them but it's not enough to actually help build that up any sort of like real momentum so you end up getting a hundred followers on five different platforms well it'd be much better if you could get 500 followers on one platform and focus all your time and energy of going from 500 to 5,000 rather than trying to take all of the five platforms with a hundred followers and say hey how do I go from a hundred to a thousand on all these different platforms this is exactly right so I one time I've never told the story in public before I had one one-on-one with Gary Vaynerchuk and we were thinking of Co writing an essay together and and and they just launched this product called Vayner commerce and I was gonna go be a part to basically be the marketing arm of the team this was before I started write a passage and I went in on Presidents Day of I think 2018 so it was a day off and nobody was in the office so Gary is sitting there but outside even though none of the people in the ad agency were there none of the accountants no one on the finance team was there but there were 15 people there and what were those 15 people there doing they were all part of Gary's team and so my point here isn't saying when you look at a lot of the big names who you say I want to be that person whether it's Gary Vaynerchuk or all these other people with big audiences generally and papas an exception here he has one full-time person who works for him but gary has like a team of 15 or 20 people who were there even on the holiday and I never forgot that because it made me realize that a lot of what these people are saying is made possible by having a lot of Labor that's working for them at all time and if you don't have that I don't have that I have just Becca it's two of us and if you don't have that what you want to do is focus on one platform and this is a way that you should ignore the social media managers who are working for big brands and ignore the big influencers yeah the one thing I'll add to that it's kind of like working out right like if you want to go benchpress 250 pounds you kind of start out with just the bar right and you get comfortable lifting the bar then you say okay I'm gonna add tens each side I'm gonna add 20 pounds and 30 pounds and 50 pounds and you kind of build the muscle memory and the strength really to kind of continue to move on but only after some period of time that you say okay you know I can benchpress if you've never lifted before once you understand bench pressing you then can move on to more complex things right and so I think it's very similar here of you just you got to build the muscle memory and so if you had told me in the beginning hey you're going to write a letter you're gonna record a YouTube show and you're gonna record podcast episodes all in the same day I would have stopped I'd have been like there's no way I literally don't have the time energy like this is overwhelming but once you get into the kind of the flow of it and you build the muscle memory and you realize like oh I can actually write the news I literally wake up I have no clue time I write about and I can bang it out in 60 minutes right and that's just because I've done it so many times now I I figured out the hacks in my head and know how to structure and all that kind of stuff that then opened up the possibility where it used to take me two hours well now I can spend an hour on the letter and then I've got this new hour open in my day why don't we go ahead and record the podcast why don't we do a YouTube show or whatever and you just begin to optimize your day but doing it from the start I think it's just a recipe for disaster and to further the working out metaphor Arnold Schwarzenegger was once what is the key to getting ripped and he gave a three word answer reps reps reps so let's move on to number four more content is better than less what a perfect transition yeah so that we are to talk about this a little bit basically the whole idea is most people will they get super nervous they're like oh I already tweeted twice today right so a lot of people always ask me like how did I grow Twitter right that was the whole key and there was two things I did the first was I made sure that every single person I could find that possibly could be interested in the content knew that I was there and the second thing was I tweeted literally until I couldn't think of anything else to tweet anymore and so the two things that end up happening is I knew that okay you just overwhelm the algorithm and you will grow right and so I said well how do I do that again by meeting that quality bar and so in 2017 III didn't have tons of opinions I wasn't super kind of comfortable just being myself yet and so instead what I did is every hour on the hour I would go to a bunch of organism media organizations I would refresh the page and I would take a story that was that they published and I basically would read it pull out some insight and then go ahead and tweet it and so what I was doing as every hour and I was tweeting like 1015 times a day but it was all I was using other people in terms of their ideas their articles like that type of stuff to give me content because I didn't yet have the muscle memory of like how do you call what 10 tweets a day right and so by doing that what I ended up doing was one I got a lot of feedback in terms of what types of tweets work what types of tweets don't work to is I was constantly putting content out there and it was increasing the possibility that one people would come across the content in my profile and the third was it was like a magnet for people who liked the things that I was saying or talking about naturally as they found it would want to follow they would want to stay engaged in things like that and so to me the whole idea of like more content is better than less that worked on Twitter it definitely works on the email right I could say hey I'm gonna write one email a week but if I say I'm gonna write five a week that's better than writing just one as long as I again meet some level of a quality bar that people find acceptable podcast I started out I was doing I think two a week then I went to three a week now do five a week well why do I do five a week it's because one I can do it in terms I have the capacity of work to do it but also to is most people if you think about your consumer behavior I go to let's say a Joe Rogan's podcast right now I want to listen to an episode I may see three episodes there since the last time I checked but I only want to listen to one of them so people get in this kind of muscle memory of like oh I want to give people enough time to listen to it like no actually it's like Netflix I want to dump as much content on your lap is that you can't as I can and you choose what you want to listen to cuz I guarantee you don't want to listen to it all right instead I'll just give you as much as possible and give you choice and so by doing that what you do is you actually end up drastically increasing the the potential addressable market if you will of your audience because now you can just create more content more content leads to more people being interested more people being interested leads to larger followers audience excetera there's a website called marginal revolution that's run by two guys named one Tyler Cowen and another Alex Tabarrok and they are both in the George Mason Economics Department and the site does a couple million views a month and there are four or five posts a day and what's really interesting about that volume of content is it is the only site that I actually go visit almost like I would visit a Twitter feed to say huh what is new here today and what's interesting is when you are cranking out content at a consistent pace you get this kind of Pavlovian excitement of you go you check out the fiend you can say huh what's new today where is something that's just once a week or every other week it doesn't have that element of surprise so let's talk about the next principle create once publish times yeah this is uh this the secret if you think about podcast I'm able to record via zoom audio and video I then take the audio and I publish it as a podcast I take the video and I publish it on YouTube I then cut up the long-form interview into highlights so I get multiple videos for YouTube out of it then take both the audio link and the video link and I put it into the email in a section that is highlighting the podcast and then I will tweet out the links to the podcast the video sometimes even the highlights etc and so off the one action of recording a podcast episode I've now created I used you know create once published five times there's just a general rule but I've actually created like eight to ten pieces of content off of that one hour of my time and so that is a mechanism or a framework that should exist across the board right if you think about when I write the email I do the same thing when I actually am tweeting even I'll do the same thing you see a lot of people now they'll tweet then they'll take the tweet no post it on Instagram right that's some version of that is you basically want to very much streamline the content creation thought process or process you go through and then what you want to do is you want to expand the amount of ways that you can use that piece of content on all the various platforms so for me that one hour investment to record a podcast episode with somebody ends up creating so much content that people are literally like how do you create all this content well as one hour of my time that then turns into all this other stuff what helps in that is a very very set process and kind of organizational you know kind of kind of really strict ethos around when we record a podcast here's exactly what we're gonna do with it and then you just get the repetitions in right you just literally over and over and over again and you quickly learn the things that work the things that don't work but this principle has has proven it's worth in gold for sure one of the things that I would just say here so this exists on a spectrum so let's take this in context of focus on one platform when you are starting so what we talked about just now of podcast YouTube channel that's something that you want to build towards so say that you are starting out you are on blog post number 20 and what could you do well here's an idea you could publish the post then you could publish a podcast of either you reading the post or what went behind the post you could publish a YouTube video of how you X created the post are you talking about it and then you could publish a tweet storm summary of what exactly you learned in the post right there that's four so look you don't need Pomp's resources and years of experience in order to do this what I just said all of you every single one no excuses can do that let's talk about the next one you owe the audience everything this is how I beat everybody straight up is there's very few people in the world that are willing to spend hours of their day talking to anonymous people on the internet and for the last three plus years I have spent literally multiple hours a day responding to every single person on Twitter responding to all of the YouTube comments every single email that somebody responds to for the email like literally just obsessing over the audience is the boss it sucks like there's days where I'm like I don't want to go answer these people that I don't know or reply but what you quickly learn again is you you understand how you can rip through you know 150 YouTube comments I can do it in 20 minutes or less how do I do that like I've got a number of things that I know are kind of safe comment so hey thanks for watching today you know I really appreciate you subscribing like that type of stuff the use of emojis is always awesome somebody says something nice you know some of the praying hands emoji all that kind of stuff and then every once in a while you respond in like a super customized way so we ask a question or whatever and what you begin to realize is what you're really doing you're telling the audience like hey I'm paying attention you're just as important as I am in this whole thing and they start to feel like they're involved in it and so imagine if every time that you go and you tweet at somebody they respond or if every time you write on a youtube comment you that person responds you of course are gonna come back right you're gonna watch their next thing you're gonna leave a comment and you begin to become emotionally invested in that content at some point it becomes unscalable I'm probably at that point now where I can't respond to every single thing so I've started to try to come up with certain hacks on well maybe I what I'll do respond to 80% of the YouTube comments and do the things that are ranked the highest right and then at the very end the last five I'm gonna answer I'll actually scroll down to the very bottom to the things they got absolutely zero engagement and I'll respond to that right and they kind of feel like holy I can't believe you went responded to that and so like by doing this over and over and over again and remembering like the audience is the reason why you have the influence why you're able to monetize why you're able to do all this it just keeps you focused on what's actually important and what I'll kind of leave with you is for those who haven't seen it yet I highly suggest going and watching there's a documentary with Garth Brooks so Garth Brooks is the best-selling solo musician of all time the documentary recently got posted on Netflix and when you watch this as a two-part series about two and a half hours it's really really interesting to me how every single person says the same thing he literally back in the early 90s or late 80s would stay after playing some honky tonk you know bar he would stay for hours and autograph every single fan that wanted an autograph till four or five o'clock in the morning he would stay and he would literally give every single person autograph he'd shake every single person's hand and he did that for years and years and years literally for more than a decade and ended up being the best selling artists of all time and so you don't have to be perfect right it's fine to miss a day or whatever but that general principle of saying the audience is the reason why I'm here I think a lot of people overlook that but to me it's probably the biggest differentiator one because you're investing your time a lot of people aren't willing to make the time investment but also to what you find is you understand what content works or what does it look if I create a piece of content audience hates it by reading the comments and responding to them I learn and so I just look at it as this very circular thing but but keeping this in mind I think it is enough people don't talk about it and also to enough people don't have the kind of dedication and energy to actually spend you know engaging with every single person in the audience I think that there's a really deep idea here around listening to your audience and that your relationship with your audiences that dance so what a lot of people do is they err on to sites the first sign that they err on is I am going to publish what I want and I don't care what anybody else thinks this is my vision and I deserve to have it in the world the other side of this is I'm just going to do what's popular and whatever gets the most engagement I'm gonna do more of it and you need some kind of synthesis between the two you want your vision but you also want to be listening to what are people responding to you what are they engaging with what surprises them what are they coming back for and pompon curious to hear how you think about those two things and as you think about it I have a story so my favorite band is called above and beyond and they are now going and releasing all these old sets and so they're sort of going back and and I was just listening to a set that they played in Hungary in 2011 and right at the beginning the the the guy at the there's there's three guys in the band one of them his name is Tony and he said that this set what they were doing is they were Road testing for their upcoming album group therapy and what road testing is is testing in live concert how are people responding to new songs before you put them into an album and it's the same idea that we use in rite of passage something called the triangle where I distinguish between what I call the Thoreau model right we're in the mid 19th century Henry David Thoreau goes to Walden Pond in the escaped Society for two years and he doesn't see any person and then he comes back with Walden this famous book and he says this is what I delivered after spending two years in solitude without talking to anybody and that doesn't really work anymore nor is it even advantageous what's better is to go from a tweet huh this tweet got a surprising amount of engagement maybe that tweet came from a conversation something that you said that somebody else was interesting or vice versa then you go from that to a blog post from a blog post to a podcast from a podcast to a YouTube video and now what you're doing is you're dancing with your audience getting feedback at every single step so my question for you pump is how do you think about that dance with your audience how do you think about the waiting on I'm gonna do what I want versus I'm just gonna give my audience what they're engaging with yeah so this all comes on authenticity right and very early on I knew that there's going to be a day where I just stop they all wake up one day in just like alright that's it I'm done and I literally never create another piece of content right and because I knew that I said to myself I want to do this my way right and my way was I want to learn I want to write about the things I want to write about I want to touch the people I want to talk about all that kind of stuff those are things that I kind of put in the I'm not willing to compromise so if somebody says hey I don't like that guest I don't care right if somebody says I don't like that you wrote about that I don't care but if somebody says to me hey the audio quality sucks we'll improve that right thanks for the feedback and so it's like I'm not willing to compromise on the really big things because again at the end of the day like I'm optimizing for doing the things I want to do like that's why I have I think the energy to do all of this is because I'm enjoying it I don't look at it as work it's fun and I'm learning and free I can't believe that I can do it but there's a ton of little things that are all of the kind of improvements than my new show that's where I listen really really intently right so if I said I'm actually more open to somebody saying had it like when you said that one sentence right or I think you misspoke here that's much more or I'm more receptive to that than if somebody says I don't like that guest right and it's because the details is where I think the audience can give you the best feedback the the big picture stuff like the audience actually probably isn't best suited to do that right it's very personal preference driven all that kind of stuff and so I think that it's not so black and white of like d-list of the audience do you not I think it's like we're in the stack of the content creation do you listen and what and and how do you put weight on certain things and much less weight on others that's a great answer let's get into some of the actionable ideas and we'll go platform by platform together and I will sprinkle in some color for my own experience as well but let's start with Twitter what should we be focused on in terms of very actionable things yeah so I'll caveat all this would like this once worked for me you know everyone's different but create more content then you possible and I always tell people ten plus tweets a day because I think ten tweets when they hear that - like there's no way I could create ten tweets it's like if you think you're creating a lot of content double it right and you probably still aren't creating enough use spacing and punctuation so very early on it became obvious to me like people were tweeting this like block of content right it was just like a run-on sentence basically was with some like sporadic periods in between it but it's really hard to read if you have to remember like you're creating content for other people so using space and spacing using punctuation like making it easier to read makes it so that they're more likely to actually ingest the information and much more likely to actually engage with it so things like list increase virality because what it essentially does is it's super clear here's exactly what I'm saying bang bang bang here's bullet points and like some call to action people are likely to retweet that favor to engage with it whatever it's very digestible links or the exact opposite I literally have to click a link to them get the information right so not only one is it a weird consumption model for me to have to click the link to then get the information there's friction there but also two is you have to remember what the social platforms incentives are they want people to stay on Twitter or Facebook or whatever platform they do not want you to send people elsewhere so they will actually not give as much reach to tweets for example that have links in them because what you're doing is you're promoting them leaving the platform and so understanding that and realizing well if I don't actually put the link in the first tweet if instead I put the content and then put the link later that type of stuff can help you hijacking viral tweets or large accounts I was doing this for a while and then eventually I think people were getting a little annoyed with it but what I essentially did the best one was I turned on tweet notifications for Donald Trump every single time Donald Trump tweets he gets hundreds of thousands of favorites he gets thousands and tens of thousands of replies and the tweets get millions of impressions and so every single time he would tweet I'd get a push notification I would literally race to respond as fast as I possibly could so that I was one of the first responses and I would do something that I thought would get a lot of engagement therefore when people were scrolling through the replies they would see Oh what is this account they click on it they would look at it some people would follow me whatever and so by doing that by hijacking these viral tweets or large accounts what you're doing is you're basically using them to do the marketing for you right they're driving impressions you're siphoning some of those impressions off into your own little world so Donald Trump Kanye West a bunch of these folks I did it for for a while even to the point of sometimes I would literally respond to Trump and be like hey Trump if you want to learn about Bitcoin go subscribe to this email right and it was it was quote-unquote directed at Trump but what I really was hoping for was people were responding to the replies like well I don't know if Trump wants to learn about that stuff but I do let me go and actually sign up for this email list and so little things like that I think helped replying to everyone we already talked about DMS or the real LinkedIn this couldn't be more true I have met more people on Twitter than anywhere else in my personal and professional life and people are just super responsive right like there's very few people you see on Twitter that have somebody else running their Twitter account for them it is them who are actually there reading everything engaging etc so if you're able to DM with them you get the real person in its way to kind of cut through the noise setting up your profile for success where do you want people to go put the link in your profile you know write it out in a way that tells people here's Who I am here's the type of content you're gonna get I think people just kind of overlook that but for me if I get you know tens of millions of impressions on my Twitter account I may get hundreds of thousands of impressions on the profile itself that's just free traffic so make sure it's set up to send people where you want to send them and then a good gift is worth a thousand favorites you know look Twitter is very text heavy but I think that as society's kind of evolved all sorts of multimedia type content is doing very well on Twitter specifically so don't be afraid to kind of use some of that stuff to your advantage as well quick comment on links if you do share a link what you want to do is you want to basically take out as much of the relevant information as possible so for example say that Apple just launched a new iPhone what you want to do rather than sharing CNBC launches new iphone actually linked to in a list the top three things that you learned from the article so that somebody can still get value from your tweet and like it and want to share it with somebody without reading the article if you can actually summarize things for people save them time compress information in different ways you can still share a link and get a lot more boosting but I think that the general principle within that is very helpful for Twitter people want to learn people are curious the thing that people don't want to do is they don't want to spend a lot of time on things not because they're lazy but because they're busy and because there's so much stuff out there and people don't want to read things that are incredibly complicated to parse and difficult and the fact of the matter is the more I've written the more I've realized that it's just true the complexity of something does not mean that it inherently has more information content sometimes that's true but this is a really weird correlation that comes from academia and if you can actually save people time make things easy for people not because they're stupid but because they are busy and because they want to learn you can do really well on Twitter and all of these platforms so let's move on to email what have you learned about email consistency wins so people will subscribe expecting something don't miss literally if you say you're gonna do it daily do it daily if you want to do it weekly do it weekly just don't miss the other thing is if you're gonna do a paid email like sub stack most people will focus on how do I grow the paid subscribers because that's where the money is it's actually the wrong way to look at it instead you want to grow the free list and then once they're on the free list then work on converting them to paid this idea of most people you know they don't just show up to the store and start buying things they've actually been conditioned over time they walked in the store that was step one you got to get them in the store what you get them in the store you got to get them comfortable with whatever you want the product to be get them to try it on right kind of walk them through through breadcrumbs to become a paying member so building that free list is very very important in the way you that is by giving more than you take right so give as much value as you can because ultimately what you're doing is you're asking for the permission to penetrate their inbox right and I say it very specifically like that people do not like more email in most cases and you are going to violate that space so you better damn be sure that you're giving them some sort of value in their inbox or they're gonna kick you out of it right and so that's a really important component of this don't be afraid to ask people to subscribe whether it's on social platforms or if let's say they're on your free list you want them to pay you just you have to be shameless when it comes to it not in kind of a super Sneaky you know oil salesman type way but instead in hey here is what I'm doing I'm putting a lot of time effort and into kind of creating this I would like you to do X in order to receive it subscribe pay whatever it is don't be shocked right know what you are worth and I think a lot of people kind of downplay that another thing is find like my audiences basically if you can find other audiences that you think will like what you have figure out how to work with the people who run those audiences so whether that's link swaps in their emails whether that's to go on and do you know live streams or whatever it is finding like-minded audiences and telling them hey if you like X you'll definitely like this thing Y that I'm doing is a great way to grow identifying inflection points are really important so for me for example I have a pretty good sense when I know a post on the letter is going to get or be received well and so rather than wait till I publish it and then go promote it I will promote it in advance I will say hey on Monday I'm writing something about a B and C if you want to read it make sure you subscribe and then a bunch of people subscribed beforehand I then publish it and then after I publish it I say hey I wrote something about ABC if you want to read it subscribe so you get more like this and so understanding those kind of inflection points and being willing to promote them in advance is really important because if you're willing to promote it after the fact you should be willing to promote it in advance as well use the email is a distribution point that in this idea of passive links pay off are kind of simultaneous what I mean by that is in the email that I write every morning I write a analysis or opinion at the top I then put a bunch of links to recent news articles and the bottom half of the email is just distribution for everything else so you'll see the podcast episode of the day there you'll see the YouTube episode you'll see a link to all the sponsors like all that kind of stuff I literally copy and paste it it's a structure or a template and I just fill in the template for the day and then I included at this bottom of the email but out of the 50,000 people who are getting this thing some percentage of them will continue to scroll down to the bottom they'll look at this stuff they'll click through though they'll kind of go explore and so you want to use the opportunity you're going into their inbox give them as much value as possible and use that email as a distribution point for the other content and then I wrote upsell upsell upsell here and what I mean by that is you always want to be delivering value but also asking the audience to help you in some way so whether that's pay pay hey will you Ford this to people hey will you tweet about this will you share it will you go and look at the other content we're creating right if you are actually delivering value you are doing the audience a favor by showing them other great content as well or asking them to help promote it to other people if you do not create good content it won't matter the others think that you're kind of a snake oil salesman and they won't care so I think that what you've got to do is this upsell ideas you want to upsell them into content that is valuable for them you're continuing to provide more value you're showing them where to go and you just got to not be scared to do that let's talk about YouTube this was the hardest one YouTube was the hardest to crack I think that first to start with you got to have the YouTube banner you wanted to explain what are you going to cover and how often so if you look at ours it says you know daily videos on technology and finance or something right and there's an arrow pointing to go subscribe so that kind of knocks out the first two points here is just being right when somebody lands I'm kind of the landing page of your YouTube you want them to know here is what this is about and go subscribe and so you're making it ask and telling them what to expect to create more videos same as other platforms more content is better you want to optimize the video title description and thumbnail this is really important YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world right a lot of people forget that YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world and therefore you want to treat your content the same way you would treat SEO in the traditional sense on just through Google so the video title what are people gonna be searching for don't write some super obscure title look in Google Trends and understand what are people searching for and incorporate that into the title of the description even the text and the thumbnail all of those things will give you a better opportunity to actually show up in the search results the description same thing like the email using that as a distribution point an email you also want to use passive links in the description so if you go into many of the best content creators and scroll down in the description you'll see they linked all their social platforms they link to emails they link to all the different things that they have because they know some portion of the tens and or hundreds of thousands of people who watch this video or going to go look at a description and they are gonna scroll down to the 17th link and if they're interested they'll click but put it there don't don't not use the distribution you already have and that gets into this pin the comment this is the single best thing you can do on YouTube if you want to promote other things so on every single YouTube interview video that we post I pinned a comment that says Tom Price a daily letter to these types of people you should go subscribe here's the link and so if you're watching the video and you scroll into the comment sections the very first comment you see is a link to go subscribe to the email so you can get more content like this and that's been a great growth driver for so whatever the thing is you're optimizing for pin it as a comment at the top of the comments to every single video also you can create an outro with each video so let's say you do an interview and then you say alright you know thanks so much end of interview you can actually cut in another video of you saying hey guys thanks so much for watching the video I hope you guys really enjoyed that one make sure you're subscribed to the channel so you get more content like this and leave a comment and I'll do my best to respond that 15 to 20 second quote unquote outro reminds people hey one of them I'm thanking you for watching the whole video right that helps with YouTube's algorithm in terms of recommending it to more people too I'm telling you specifically at the end of the video right at that emotional point where you are thankful that you got to watch this content go subscribe three leave a comment right now I'm telling you all the things to do in the audience that 15-second outro can just be a clip that's pre-recorded and you drop at the end of every single video before you upload it so it's kind of again you're streamlining the content creation process but you're getting maximum impact for recording a one-time 15-second outro you search trends to your advantage no-brainer and then leverage guess with large audiences right I mean this is kind of a no-brainer as well but basically if you bring people on who have big audiences and they share your content you are more likely to get more views on that content so don't be scared to reach out to people with big audiences and say hey I want to bring you on my channel or bring you on my podcast or write about you my email whatever and can you then share it once it's created before we get into podcast I have a quick question for you how do you think about the trade-off between walled garden content and open content so open content is good because with writing this is where the trade-off happens the most with the pomp letter I believe you publish for exclusive ones and then one public one a week why did you settle on the for one split because certainly if you had five open ones the writing would spread to more people but then you'd have less of a demand for subscription whereas if you had five and you didn't have a public one every week then you could have more subscription but you give up in marketing how do you think about that trade-off well in hindsight I looked smart but honestly the way that I thought of it the first time was Ben Thompson did one for free and four and three behind a paywall and I was like what was good enough for Ben then is good enough for me and so I figured that he had done a lot more kind of intellectual thinking about our critical thinking about why he did that and I said look he's been doing it for years so why don't I just benefit from all the work he's done but but in hindsight the key was people want to pay for the exclusive content right so having to for behind the paywall helps but you still need some sort of public growth writer engine and so being able to show people hey if you are subscriber on the email this is what you'll get that gets them onto the free list and then once they're on the free list I can then say to them hey you should go ahead and subscribe to the paid ones so that you get the same email five times a week rather than just the one time you're getting it now right so you're basically kind of proving your value before you actually ask them to pay what have you learned about delivering to subscribers and what subscribers want what what has made you settle on the equilibrium of focusing on emails what what has made you not focus maybe more on personal Q&A s and other things like that life meetups like how do you think about what is the subscriber paying for what do they want and how do I give that to them it's all around up tonight I'm so I can one of the issues with a podcast that's interview style is I have to rely on other people so I got to find the people I've got to get them to agree to do the podcast I've got to make sure they've got good audio good video all that kind of stuff and then I've got to schedule the time right then I've got to get it recorded edited whatever with the email I wake up I spend one hour it's just me that's all I have to rely on I write what I want to write I publish it and I move on I don't think about it again till the next day and so when you think of it in that sense a lot of the content decisions that I make are actually behind the scenes being streamlined so that I can have this kind of enormous body of work or output I'm making my life easier and I've come to realize that as long as it's again meet some quality bar that I have in my head of this is something I'm proud of then the right people will find it right there's plenty of people who wish that I wrote something else or wrote you know five out for public or whatever those aren't the right people right so I'm not trying to get everybody I just want to find the right audience because that right audience will stay with me you know for years and years to come and says can I think about it let's talk about the podcast you have blown it up you now have one of the thirty biggest business podcasts in the world what has been the key to success there persistence when I started actually I didn't even think I was gonna start a podcast for that kind of in hindsight like I record a couple episodes it did really know what I was doing but yeah I was just persistence it was just over time grinding it out every once in a while an episode would kind of explode you get some more subscribers and you can kind of see the baseline of downloads over time just continued to increase and so it just took time and if you think about you know Tim Ferriss Joe rogue and all these top podcast most of them were started you know 7 plus years ago 10 years ago and again they just had time right and they took a long time for them to build those audiences and so I think the same thing with podcasts today if you're gonna start again you just got to be super committed to doing it consistently and it takes time and so this whole idea of like set frequency and don't miss an episode you're building trust right if you tell people I'm gonna do it once a week and then all of a sudden you don't have an episode for two weeks people are like well that's kind of like why am i subscribed to this right like I I don't know what to expect and therefore they move on other things here target guess with large audience we already talked about one little hack every author that's got a new book they're always looking to promote their work so if you want to kind of you know start the flywheel of getting good guests go find people who are coming out with books and then get them to come on your podcast because they want to promote their books recording verse via zoom you get audio and video so it allows you then to cut it later like we talked about and publish on different platforms good microphone and good lighting a lot of people kind of overlook this in the beginning I used to think it wasn't important until you then use a good microphone and good lighting and then you rise how important it actually is so just focus on the beginning you can use micro content to promote individual episodes summon investor in a company called shuffle they basically let you pull kind of 60-second clips out of a podcast and then you can tweet them and it's got kind of a cool visual that goes with it whatever that's a great way to kind of tease an episode or tell people hey listen to this one 60-second clip if you thought this was interesting go listen to the full episode here that's super interesting and then transcripts and show notes I did this for awhile it's really hard to do when you're cranking out one a day the transcripts take a long time and the show notes or it can be really tedious if you do it right but if you're pumping out content and a less frequent model so say once a week for example transcripts and show notes one not only are great for the audience cuz they can use them to learn and content but also to is if you published them somewhere publicly they're fantastic for SEO so you can imagine if you record an episode with somebody turn about ten topics you're just increasing the surface area of SEO to drive traffic to that episode so I highly suggest that if it makes sense from a frequency standpoint but if you're gonna do you know an episode a day it gets to be pretty difficult yeah quick comment on the book idea that I have a question for you so yesterday I got to interview Seth Godin and I was on Amazon last week and I was just sort of looking around and like whenever I pass a bookstore I walk in I spend a lot of time on Amazon just sort of like scrolling the new books so I've like my my sense of like what's new what's coming out is like very attuned just to figure out like what are people interested in and I saw on Amazon November like 17th or something Seth Godin is coming out with a new book so I immediately emailed Seth Godin and I said hi Seth I would like to be the very first person to interview you for your new book he responded said you are the very first person to ask me about the new book interview I'd love to do it how about a time next week and we'll hold the podcast until November so that's exactly what we did and it's the same sort of thing then I was talking to another big author this week same thing he said you know what the book is coming out in December let's table the podcast until then and then we can do it so I've been thinking about how to get bigger and bigger guests and this book thing is definitely a big opportunity for growth question for you pomp how do you think about different revenue slits between each each section so you say Twitter is the hub but you don't make money from Twitter so how do you think about revenue and actually turning this into a full-on business model yeah in the ideal world I would never deal with an advertiser but I've thought a ton of times about just making everything subscriber based as of right now there's advertising that goes on in the podcast but I don't even have advertising turned on on YouTube for example because I was growing so much for me it's way these things where like this Ruby was kind of a side thing and so I wanted it to be profitable but I wasn't sitting there trying to squeak out every last dollar and over time what I realized is as I 01:0:2,400 --> 01:0:3,999 01:0:2,410 --> 01:0:5,829 created more and more value for people 01:0:3,989 --> 01:0:5,829 01:0:3,999 --> 01:0:7,089 they were happy to pay like literally 01:0:5,819 --> 01:0:7,089 01:0:5,829 --> 01:0:8,739 people would send me emails and be like 01:0:7,079 --> 01:0:8,739 01:0:7,089 --> 01:0:11,890 I cannot believe that I get that email 01:0:8,729 --> 01:0:11,890 01:0:8,739 --> 01:0:13,809 every single day and it's so cheap 01:0:11,880 --> 01:0:13,809 01:0:11,890 --> 01:0:16,119 well you're underselling me and I was 01:0:13,799 --> 01:0:16,119 01:0:13,809 --> 01:0:17,619 like well I should I like increase the 01:0:16,109 --> 01:0:17,619 01:0:16,119 --> 01:0:19,509 price you know you certainly think like 01:0:17,609 --> 01:0:19,509 01:0:17,619 --> 01:0:20,890 oh wait maybe I'm like under estimating 01:0:19,499 --> 01:0:20,890 01:0:19,509 --> 01:0:23,289 this but then you realize like there's 01:0:20,880 --> 01:0:23,289 01:0:20,890 --> 01:0:25,359 non-economic benefits as well so for 01:0:23,279 --> 01:0:25,359 01:0:23,289 --> 01:0:27,220 example I want as big of an audience as 01:0:25,349 --> 01:0:27,220 01:0:25,359 --> 01:0:29,859 possible on the email so I'll actually 01:0:27,210 --> 01:0:29,859 01:0:27,220 --> 01:0:32,079 keep the price low and a lot of times 01:0:29,849 --> 01:0:32,079 01:0:29,859 --> 01:0:34,839 what I'll do is I'll even discount right 01:0:32,069 --> 01:0:34,839 01:0:32,079 --> 01:0:38,619 so I think the actual state in price of 01:0:34,829 --> 01:0:38,619 01:0:34,839 --> 01:0:40,869 the newsletter is $30 a month and 300 01:0:38,609 --> 01:0:40,869 01:0:38,619 --> 01:0:42,369 dollars a year but pretty much everyone 01:0:40,859 --> 01:0:42,369 01:0:40,869 --> 01:0:44,170 has signed up at 10 bucks because I just 01:0:42,359 --> 01:0:44,170 01:0:42,369 --> 01:0:46,539 keep a discount running almost you know 01:0:44,160 --> 01:0:46,539 01:0:44,170 --> 01:0:48,249 all the time right and so why do I do 01:0:46,529 --> 01:0:48,249 01:0:46,539 --> 01:0:49,720 that it's because I don't want to just 01:0:48,239 --> 01:0:49,720 01:0:48,249 --> 01:0:51,970 optimize for as much money as possible 01:0:49,710 --> 01:0:51,970 01:0:49,720 --> 01:0:54,519 I'm actually optimizing for kind of this 01:0:51,960 --> 01:0:54,519 01:0:51,970 --> 01:0:56,349 balance between revenue and having the 01:0:54,509 --> 01:0:56,349 01:0:54,519 --> 01:0:58,749 largest audience that I can have right 01:0:56,339 --> 01:0:58,749 01:0:56,349 --> 01:1:1,150 and that equilibrium is really important 01:0:58,739 --> 01:1:1,150 01:0:58,749 --> 01:1:3,279 and also there's a sort of Jason 01:1:1,140 --> 01:1:3,279 01:1:1,150 --> 01:1:4,900 Calacanis Tim Ferriss model where angel 01:1:3,269 --> 01:1:4,900 01:1:3,279 --> 01:1:6,789 investing actually becomes the thing 01:1:4,890 --> 01:1:6,789 01:1:4,900 --> 01:1:10,029 that's profitable I think both of them 01:1:6,779 --> 01:1:10,029 01:1:6,789 --> 01:1:12,039 invested in uber and that then it became 01:1:10,019 --> 01:1:12,039 01:1:10,029 --> 01:1:13,119 something that was an opportunity for 01:1:12,029 --> 01:1:13,119 01:1:12,039 --> 01:1:14,739 them and you see the same thing 01:1:13,109 --> 01:1:14,739 01:1:13,119 --> 01:1:16,720 happening throughout the Silicon Valley 01:1:14,729 --> 01:1:16,720 01:1:14,739 --> 01:1:18,789 ecosystem where people build audiences 01:1:16,710 --> 01:1:18,789 01:1:16,720 --> 01:1:21,940 then they become angel investors I 01:1:18,779 --> 01:1:21,940 01:1:18,789 --> 01:1:25,299 invest in companies and education in 01:1:21,930 --> 01:1:25,299 01:1:21,940 --> 01:1:27,849 productivity and at the intersection of 01:1:25,289 --> 01:1:27,849 01:1:25,299 --> 01:1:30,430 sort of creator monetization so that has 01:1:27,839 --> 01:1:30,430 01:1:27,849 --> 01:1:32,019 been really helpful for me and likewise 01:1:30,420 --> 01:1:32,019 01:1:30,430 --> 01:1:34,180 for you you're making angel investments 01:1:32,009 --> 01:1:34,180 01:1:32,019 --> 01:1:35,739 and then like Rahul Vora just raised the 01:1:34,170 --> 01:1:35,739 01:1:34,180 --> 01:1:37,869 founder of super human just raised a 01:1:35,729 --> 01:1:37,869 01:1:35,739 --> 01:1:40,269 seven million dollar fund and it's based 01:1:37,859 --> 01:1:40,269 01:1:37,869 --> 01:1:42,009 on turning an audience into investments 01:1:40,259 --> 01:1:42,009 01:1:40,269 --> 01:1:43,989 so I think that what you just said there 01:1:41,999 --> 01:1:43,989 01:1:42,009 --> 01:1:46,539 is very important that there's a lot of 01:1:43,979 --> 01:1:46,539 01:1:43,989 --> 01:1:48,099 different ways that you can get paid and 01:1:46,529 --> 01:1:48,099 01:1:46,539 --> 01:1:49,539 money is just one of them you can get 01:1:48,089 --> 01:1:49,539 01:1:48,099 --> 01:1:51,339 paid in access you can get paid in 01:1:49,529 --> 01:1:51,339 01:1:49,539 --> 01:1:53,470 influence you can get paid in being able 01:1:51,329 --> 01:1:53,470 01:1:51,339 --> 01:1:55,599 to have amazing conversations like this 01:1:53,460 --> 01:1:55,599 01:1:53,470 --> 01:1:57,369 like how lucky am i I basically get to 01:1:55,589 --> 01:1:57,369 01:1:55,599 --> 01:1:59,700 have this conversation with you and ask 01:1:57,359 --> 01:1:59,700 01:1:57,369 --> 01:2:3,190 every single question that I have and 01:1:59,690 --> 01:2:3,190 01:1:59,700 --> 01:2:5,109 that is another way that I'm paid so for 01:2:3,180 --> 01:2:5,109 01:2:3,190 --> 01:2:7,749 all of you I think that like one of the 01:2:5,099 --> 01:2:7,749 01:2:5,109 --> 01:2:8,560 things to think about like even look at 01:2:7,739 --> 01:2:8,560 01:2:7,749 --> 01:2:10,690 a lot of media 01:2:8,550 --> 01:2:10,690 01:2:8,560 --> 01:2:12,760 Moghuls like Rupert Murdoch who of 01:2:10,680 --> 01:2:12,760 01:2:10,690 --> 01:2:16,150 course owns Fox News and is a big media 01:2:12,750 --> 01:2:16,150 01:2:12,760 --> 01:2:19,210 mogul in Australia he is basically 01:2:16,140 --> 01:2:19,210 01:2:16,150 --> 01:2:22,030 getting paid in influence and the 01:2:19,200 --> 01:2:22,030 01:2:19,210 --> 01:2:25,390 ability for his ideas to take hold in 01:2:22,020 --> 01:2:25,390 01:2:22,030 --> 01:2:27,100 the real world and not just what he's 01:2:25,380 --> 01:2:27,100 01:2:25,390 --> 01:2:29,230 making money with you could see Jeff 01:2:27,090 --> 01:2:29,230 01:2:27,100 --> 01:2:31,360 Bezos bought The Washington Post that is 01:2:29,220 --> 01:2:31,360 01:2:29,230 --> 01:2:34,840 making money and influence and so what 01:2:31,350 --> 01:2:34,840 01:2:31,360 --> 01:2:37,600 you're seeing is what media does it's 01:2:34,830 --> 01:2:37,600 01:2:34,840 --> 01:2:38,680 never been the best business sorry pop 01:2:37,590 --> 01:2:38,680 01:2:37,600 --> 01:2:41,980 you're not going to build the next 01:2:38,670 --> 01:2:41,980 01:2:38,680 --> 01:2:45,250 fortune 100 company doing this but what 01:2:41,970 --> 01:2:45,250 01:2:41,980 --> 01:2:47,530 you do see is people who have that then 01:2:45,240 --> 01:2:47,530 01:2:45,250 --> 01:2:49,630 get into exactly what pump already has 01:2:47,520 --> 01:2:49,630 01:2:47,530 --> 01:2:51,640 and I think that's really interesting to 01:2:49,620 --> 01:2:51,640 01:2:49,630 --> 01:2:53,380 consider as you think about what it 01:2:51,630 --> 01:2:53,380 01:2:51,640 --> 01:2:55,780 means to run a media business and the 01:2:53,370 --> 01:2:55,780 01:2:53,380 --> 01:2:58,200 benefits of having an audience good 01:2:55,770 --> 01:2:58,200 01:2:55,780 --> 01:2:58,200 agree more 01:2:59,630 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:2:59,640 --> 01:3:5,770 there we go so mom I'm dead serious with 01:3:3,810 --> 01:3:5,770 01:3:3,820 --> 01:3:6,750 this slide people will laugh but I'm 01:3:5,760 --> 01:3:6,750 01:3:5,770 --> 01:3:9,130 dead serious 01:3:6,740 --> 01:3:9,130 01:3:6,750 --> 01:3:10,720 people will underestimate how much time 01:3:9,120 --> 01:3:10,720 01:3:9,130 --> 01:3:13,120 this takes and how long you've got to 01:3:10,710 --> 01:3:13,120 01:3:10,720 --> 01:3:15,820 work on it but I continue to say it like 01:3:13,110 --> 01:3:15,820 01:3:13,120 --> 01:3:17,080 only try it if you're going to put the 01:3:15,810 --> 01:3:17,080 01:3:15,820 --> 01:3:20,200 time in because if we want to put time 01:3:17,070 --> 01:3:20,200 01:3:17,080 --> 01:3:22,330 in it can it can be super valuable but 01:3:20,190 --> 01:3:22,330 01:3:20,200 --> 01:3:24,220 but if you're just gonna you know try it 01:3:22,320 --> 01:3:24,220 01:3:22,330 --> 01:3:26,530 sometimes or do it one day a week or 01:3:24,210 --> 01:3:26,530 01:3:24,220 --> 01:3:28,000 anything like that your end up not only 01:3:26,520 --> 01:3:28,000 01:3:26,530 --> 01:3:29,050 one not being successful with it - 01:3:27,990 --> 01:3:29,050 01:3:28,000 --> 01:3:31,330 you're gonna get frustrated because it's 01:3:29,040 --> 01:3:31,330 01:3:29,050 --> 01:3:32,890 not growing and and you don't have an 01:3:31,320 --> 01:3:32,890 01:3:31,330 --> 01:3:35,050 audience so I think you just got to kind 01:3:32,880 --> 01:3:35,050 01:3:32,890 --> 01:3:36,370 of have a introspective look of does it 01:3:35,040 --> 01:3:36,370 01:3:35,050 --> 01:3:37,840 actually make sense for me to do this to 01:3:36,360 --> 01:3:37,840 01:3:36,370 --> 01:3:41,710 have the time to dedicate to it and if I 01:3:37,830 --> 01:3:41,710 01:3:37,840 --> 01:3:44,410 do then they get started I have two more 01:3:41,700 --> 01:3:44,410 01:3:41,710 --> 01:3:46,510 questions for you so the first is where 01:3:44,400 --> 01:3:46,510 01:3:44,410 --> 01:3:50,080 do you see this going like in in 10 01:3:46,500 --> 01:3:50,080 01:3:46,510 --> 01:3:52,830 years what do you want to have so I'm 01:3:50,070 --> 01:3:52,830 01:3:50,080 --> 01:3:56,050 pretty open about this all of the 01:3:52,820 --> 01:3:56,050 01:3:52,830 --> 01:3:59,530 distribution and audience stuff is just 01:3:56,040 --> 01:3:59,530 01:3:56,050 --> 01:4:0,790 a gateway drug I understand that the way 01:3:59,520 --> 01:4:0,790 01:3:59,530 --> 01:4:3,580 businesses are going to get it built in 01:4:0,780 --> 01:4:3,580 01:4:0,790 --> 01:4:5,170 the future is they will actually build 01:4:3,570 --> 01:4:5,170 01:4:3,580 --> 01:4:6,730 the customer base first and then they 01:4:5,160 --> 01:4:6,730 01:4:5,170 --> 01:4:9,400 will build the products to sell to those 01:4:6,720 --> 01:4:9,400 01:4:6,730 --> 01:4:10,120 customers I make no qualms about us it's 01:4:9,390 --> 01:4:10,120 01:4:9,400 --> 01:4:14,080 not what I'm doing 01:4:10,110 --> 01:4:14,080 01:4:10,120 --> 01:4:16,090 I am building out massive customer bases 01:4:14,070 --> 01:4:16,090 01:4:14,080 --> 01:4:17,350 and we already working on a couple of 01:4:16,080 --> 01:4:17,350 01:4:16,090 --> 01:4:20,830 different products that we will then 01:4:17,340 --> 01:4:20,830 01:4:17,350 --> 01:4:22,420 sell through to to the audience but 01:4:20,820 --> 01:4:22,420 01:4:20,830 --> 01:4:23,980 there are things that we already 01:4:22,410 --> 01:4:23,980 01:4:22,420 --> 01:4:25,510 we'll have product market fit right 01:4:23,970 --> 01:4:25,510 01:4:23,980 --> 01:4:28,240 we're not worried about going and 01:4:25,500 --> 01:4:28,240 01:4:25,510 --> 01:4:31,180 finding the audience and so that's kind 01:4:28,230 --> 01:4:31,180 01:4:28,240 --> 01:4:34,180 of the the idea here of a forward 01:4:31,170 --> 01:4:34,180 01:4:31,180 --> 01:4:35,619 building yeah I mean this is why I'm so 01:4:34,170 --> 01:4:35,619 01:4:34,180 --> 01:4:37,420 focused on right of passage so I have 01:4:35,609 --> 01:4:37,420 01:4:35,619 --> 01:4:39,280 this idea called audience first products 01:4:37,410 --> 01:4:39,280 01:4:37,420 --> 01:4:41,049 that in the twentieth century if you 01:4:39,270 --> 01:4:41,049 01:4:39,280 --> 01:4:42,640 took something like tide right tide 01:4:41,039 --> 01:4:42,640 01:4:41,049 --> 01:4:45,190 laundry detergent what did they do they 01:4:42,630 --> 01:4:45,190 01:4:42,640 --> 01:4:47,440 went out and somebody had an idea some 01:4:45,180 --> 01:4:47,440 01:4:45,190 --> 01:4:49,809 inventor said I am going to come out and 01:4:47,430 --> 01:4:49,809 01:4:47,440 --> 01:4:52,119 build tide laundry detergent ok we now 01:4:49,799 --> 01:4:52,119 01:4:49,809 --> 01:4:54,010 have the product what do we do well we 01:4:52,109 --> 01:4:54,010 01:4:52,119 --> 01:4:55,780 have to go build an audience so let's go 01:4:54,000 --> 01:4:55,780 01:4:54,010 --> 01:4:58,240 on television let's go in newspapers 01:4:55,770 --> 01:4:58,240 01:4:55,780 --> 01:5:0,069 magazines let's do the marketing now 01:4:58,230 --> 01:5:0,069 01:4:58,240 --> 01:5:2,079 we're seeing this inversion and this has 01:5:0,059 --> 01:5:2,079 01:5:0,069 --> 01:5:4,780 to do with the internet because power on 01:5:2,069 --> 01:5:4,780 01:5:2,079 --> 01:5:7,119 the internet and economic power flows to 01:5:4,770 --> 01:5:7,119 01:5:4,780 --> 01:5:9,430 people not who controls supply with 01:5:7,109 --> 01:5:9,430 01:5:7,119 --> 01:5:11,020 people who control demand and so what 01:5:9,420 --> 01:5:11,020 01:5:9,430 --> 01:5:13,599 that means is the person who has the 01:5:11,010 --> 01:5:13,599 01:5:11,020 --> 01:5:16,030 relationship with the customer wins 01:5:13,589 --> 01:5:16,030 01:5:13,599 --> 01:5:17,950 first of all second of all when it comes 01:5:16,020 --> 01:5:17,950 01:5:16,030 --> 01:5:19,960 to the businesses that pop and I run 01:5:17,940 --> 01:5:19,960 01:5:17,950 --> 01:5:22,450 where we both have one full-time 01:5:19,950 --> 01:5:22,450 01:5:19,960 --> 01:5:25,480 employee working for us what you end up 01:5:22,440 --> 01:5:25,480 01:5:22,450 --> 01:5:27,069 seeing is if you can control the 01:5:25,470 --> 01:5:27,069 01:5:25,480 --> 01:5:29,410 relationship with your customer guess 01:5:27,059 --> 01:5:29,410 01:5:27,069 --> 01:5:31,900 what you don't have to pay advertising 01:5:29,400 --> 01:5:31,900 01:5:29,410 --> 01:5:35,200 costs you can skirt around Facebook and 01:5:31,890 --> 01:5:35,200 01:5:31,900 --> 01:5:37,059 Google get this roughly 40 cents of 01:5:35,190 --> 01:5:37,059 01:5:35,200 --> 01:5:39,640 every dollar raised for venture capital 01:5:37,049 --> 01:5:39,640 01:5:37,059 --> 01:5:41,650 goes to Facebook and Google paid 01:5:39,630 --> 01:5:41,650 01:5:39,640 --> 01:5:44,440 advertising what's happened for me with
