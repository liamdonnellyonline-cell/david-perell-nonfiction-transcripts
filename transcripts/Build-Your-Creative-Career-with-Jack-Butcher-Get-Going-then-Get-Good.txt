welcome to my get going then get good workshop with jack butcher jack is the founder of visualize value and i'm the founder of write a passage and this is an idea that jack and i have been talking about for a couple of years first how do you get started then once you do get started how do you actually listen to the world for feedback to get a sense on what's working what's not working and how as a creator you want to double down on the things that are resonating with an audience so that you can go from getting going in order to then eventually get good so this is a 90-minute presentation jack presents first i present second and then at the end we have some time for q a now i want to introduce the man of the day mr jack butcher who's wearing his terry black's barbecue hat uh which is literally five minutes away from me and austin jack hello man good afternoon how is everybody so this is uh obviously you guys are familiar with this statement here that's the name of the webinar that we are currently occupying and dave and i have gone back and forth around this idea for a long time i think there's similarities in both of our experiences not only in valuing this statement looking back retrospectively but in the materials that davis built in right of passage and i've built in visualized value this is just such a core principle of what building uh reputation online comes down to what attracting creative work opportunities comes down to and uh what i would like to share today is something i've only um haven't shared this publicly only sort of behind closed door very small visualized value uh client meetings so hopefully it's uh an interesting look at the journey from practitioner to um building a reputation for yourself and doing something really specific online so to see it off i want to talk about this idea that again is very central to [Music] the business of building uh like a creative portfolio online and for me this was a huge uh just having this mental model was a huge release of pressure so the sawdust principle actually i think was coined uh in the context of somebody who ran a business selling wood so you cut down trees chop up wood put into two by fours whatever else and there's this huge amount of uh product or like off cuts and sawdust that is produced as you refine these pieces of work uh and this product that you're selling to one market and sawdust i think applies even more so in the context of doing creative work the idea that there is a um incredible an incredible amount of material that is produced from the act of producing something and it's a simple tweak in in how you think but it can really arm you with a lot of uh a lot of assets that you can you can publish so proof of work in the context of graphic design for me started 10 11 years ago or so and i think one of the reasons design led me down this path is because design has always been about proof of work and i think a lot of professions are becoming about proof of work more than they may used to have been so the you know any interview you would attend as a designer you have to show your portfolio so nobody's really that bothered about the credentials on your cv they just want to look at the work you've produced and make an assessment based on you know the quality the style that you know whether or not that's something that fits their uh their aesthetic or their their goals so the idea that sawdust and portfolio building and proof of work was a huge part of all of the steps that i made in my career previously before i became an entrepreneur tried to um do anything independently so this is my cv as it stands i worked in eight different um i'm sorry six different agencies up here so exit creative i started there in 2010 the the five following jobs were sort of bouncing around those nine months at a time and leveraging the work i did in each of those positions to get i don't know one percent pay rise and a new job somewhere else but ultimately ended up being the same sort of burnout cycle and then the bottom row here these are three different businesses that i built myself the first being a creative agency that was you know had no specialization whatsoever the second being a slightly specialized creative agency and the third being visualized value which has a very specific focus and output so get going then get good i think in the context of in the context of the thing you produce is true but it's also true in the context of you know gathering experiences and kind of tweaking your uh tweaking your approach uh in different situations so it's not like you wake up one day and you have this eureka moment it really is this grind of you know gathering experience from all these different places and slowly refining that into a place where you have a a very specific thing to offer so throughout my career i got this i had this um you know even from university you get into this muscle of just publishing uh publishing your work and this was before i had i was active on twitter or any social uh platforms this is like a designer to design a platform called dribble you may be familiar with it but it's relatively um it's not really a social network you just post uh images there and it was kind of just a muscle developed as part of the creative process no work came of it no network building nothing so but i was i was determined to continue to publish work here just as a way to walk into a job interview and say here's the work i've produced so over time i started to discover the benefits of do like basically performing the same action but on a network that has far more um a far more chance of reaching people that need what i was building so i love this idea from naval it's not 10 000 hours that creates outliers it's 10 000 iterations and you know if we map that back to the idea of getting going that's i think uh a more precise way to talk about how people actually improve it's not the amount of time you spend you can um another way people reference this i'm not i can't remember who said it originally but um the idea that if you stay in a job for 20 years the majority of people don't have 20 years experience they have one year of experience repeated 20 times so this idea of putting yourself in different situations and exposing yourself to the need to iterate to me is it's not intuitive in the moment but you kind of have to trust the the idea that you'll eventually reach a place where all of these pieces kind of lock in lock in place in hindsight another great steve jobs quote that we talked about in the last webinar david and i did is this idea of collecting dots so um steve jobs attended typography seminars pulled computers apart as a kid dad was a carpenter i believe and the way he constructed cabinets made the back of the cabinet just as well finished as the front of the cabinet and all of these different disparate experiences ended up in apple and the products that apple made it wasn't waking up one day and thinking i'm gonna invent the iphone it has a lot to do with all of the situations he exposed themselves to and trusting that following your curiosity is going to bring you this level of expertise that you can combine in new and interesting ways so i just threw a few slides in here of all the variations of work that i was um working on before visualize value was a thing so commercial work for agencies like building and designing digital products applications social media posts all sorts of stuff shooting commercials for car brands and then as i started to find um what i was uniquely good at which was counterintuitive in the world of marketing and advertising which is the the presentations that you would use to win the work so not the thing that the client was paying for but the thing that you would use to convince the client to pay you and those moments i think i didn't pay attention to when i was producing the thing because it was counterintuitive in that environment but in hindsight you can really see that there is value in uh in the things that most people don't want to do and that's that was definitely the case with this so i would invest far more time in this laborious boring part of the process than the other designers art directors whoever else in uh in my my colleagues in whichever of those previous jobs i was referencing and that just turned out to be the thing that helped me move from you know being anything or everything to everyone or just being a designer or creative person to wrapping that up in this very specific value proposition essentially whereas like if you have something complicated to explain i can help you visualize it and explain it um better to whoever you need to explain it while i was doing that i was working on this other little agency business which was essentially a productized podcast studio which i think if um if you know visualize value work if you see this this navy blue in the bottom right down here the experts unleash there's a little bit of the dna of visualized value it's kind of creeping into this work so um designer for hire but starting to identify a bit of a style or this thing that i think i'm uniquely interested in so i started to creep into other work and i noticed the theme and then eventually trusted it enough to just turn that into the thing and because the internet is such a crazy exponential place you can be that focused and produce and and build a decent audience that way another way of saying 10 000 iterations or 10 000 reps here it's uh like a fact of nature that your repeated stress and exposure to uh shock and different challenges results in growth so i want to rewind it back because you know might look like a highlight reel here and uh the idea that you know you're just laying golden eggs but i can tell you that that is 100 not the case so i was writing a blog when i moved to new york in 2010 i don't think anybody has ever read this blog i actually was looking for the url before before this meeting and now i can see it up in the in the url bar there but i was writing a blog to nobody i was posting my thoughts to twitter for some reason nobody was uh reading them i don't think i had a network of people on there but i started 10 11 years ago publishing work putting stuff out there and this is another great highlight when i first started my agency business the only people that were commenting on my posts were my mom and her friends with completely irrelevant nonsensical stuff so they definitely didn't read what i was writing they were just commenting on this picture of potatoes which i was trying to be clever with and even a couple of years ago i was posting um visualized value content to facebook with literally zero reception or in this case you know friends and family are like oh jack's doing this cute graphic design thing it wasn't until i got into the world of twitter and these networks that spread ideas uh in a very different way than a closed network like facebook did i i see the potential of this thing uh one more thing uh how am i doing on time by the way david i want to make sure i'm uh keep rolling man this is great so this is another i think an interesting contrast so i was of the mindset before i started using twitter um aggressively i would say these people who were once my absolute idols design heroes this guy uh tobias van schneider if you haven't seen his work check it out he's incredibly talented dude and like a massive massive um inspiration of mine throughout my career and i remember um like just replying to his tweets this is five years ago or something and uh five years later when i was doing my work in public i i had found the focus to visualize value he hit me up and he's like would you like to write an article on my blog which was a blog that i'd read for eight years going through design school and got a lot of my inspiration from so those opportunities uh that arose as a result of literally doing the same thing i was doing but doing it in an environment where somebody could eventually see it led to all of these outcomes that obviously you could never predict another example my wife is the only person that's reading my uh post back here in 2019 still so there's definitely uh it's kind of a combination of just sticking at it for an incredibly long time and eventually finding the formula so i think there's you know there's no perfect way to explain this but persistence to a degree is is obviously an ingredient that's required and then iteration as we mentioned up above and this is another personal milestone of mine naval a huge influence when i read that that tweet thread on um that's pinned on the top of this profile here how to get rich without getting lucky a lot of those ideas really helped me think about and execute on what visualized value is and then you know a year later after taking all those principles and putting them into practice was able to credit naval for um helping me figure this stuff out essentially even though we've never spoken in person and the sort of retweet or the implied uh at least acknowledgement of the fact that those ideas had um by taking those ideas and executed on them was another milestone in my mind um so i tried to do some back of the envelope math here so before visualized value i was working 60 hours a week for 10 years 31 000 hours since then this is actually a little old these stats so it's probably up from here a little bit visualized value itself is 3600 hours of focus which is you know 3 500 tweets thousand graphics 200 articles working on 10 platforms so built out from a twitter feed to instagram substack shopify mighty networks youtube built like very specific websites but it wasn't until finding that thing that i expanded out on into all of these different platforms and again just another plug for twitter as probably something that could have cut my journey short by a few years at least because i was publishing to these networks that essentially had closed the way ideas spread around closed networks is very different than something like twitter and you could also attribute this to just how many more people are on twitter now than were five years ago but i do believe in uh like massively in the power of twitter as a platform i know that's a huge recommendation of david's as well and writing is obviously an incredible skill to build your network on twitter but amazing um amazing what can happen in new year and another thing i would say is look early on i would get frustrated with the idea that oh man i i can't overwhelm people with content i can't be posting 20 times a day i can't have an idea pop in my head and then just write it out but that i would attribute that behavior of just being like relentlessly curious and publishing even to the point where you feel like this may be too much it worked for me and people that i hadn't spoken to in years and years and years would reach out and say i just see your stuff everywhere at this point and i didn't even know that they were uh you know they were following the work or they were on platform x and um yeah it's uh you're there's just such a barrage of um of noise you're up against too so the more effectively you can turn what you're doing into um into something you can broadca broadcast frequently the more opportunity comes your way uh and then i'll just end on this idea which is you know getting going i think is about collecting these spheres so you stumble into all these different areas of interest throughout your career books you read places you go people you meet i think holding these two ideas in your head separately is very difficult but i think it's um i think it's powerful that there is a certain this this phase of your life never never stops right this attitude should never stop the idea that you're still collecting experiences but at a certain point you get to a place where you can get aligned with a ton of those ideas start to to layer on top of each other and you can build something that represents that unique combination of ideas and that's what visualize value became after you know 10 11 12 you could even say 32 years of sort of messing about and doing a bunch of different things and being exposed to different environments people places uh problems and one of the things i wanted to also get in here there's not a slight to represent this but there's absolutely nothing wrong with getting gathering that experienced by joining networks that already exist so um i could attribute so much of my skill set to working in an agency environment where a different problem was thrown at me every single day and i couldn't you know pick and choose what i was working on i was just told hey we've gotta get this thing out the door let's do it um and i think you know there's so much value in just identifying what stage you're at and working on either gathering new experience or synthesizing or a combination of the two it's it's not this linear process that really the most cliche advice trust the process the things will align look backwards and line things up but that's really what what happened and hopefully the slides above demonstrated some of that and i believe that's my last slide i have a question for you how do you think of all this given your principle of make noise and listen for signal you showed some of your earlier tweets that were getting no engagement and the fact that you weren't succeeding so i want to hear you talk about how you balance the listening to others knowing when you're doing well as a creative but also making sure that you're not listening to people so much that you're just some automaton who's just doing whatever the audience wants and actually being able to orient yourself towards a brand that's as distinct as visualized value yeah good question and one thing i think that wasn't in this particular presentation is the idea of i haven't talked about this at all really but the idea of service is where all of this comes from so i think coming from a we talked about this as well david it might even need another session to get like all the way through this idea but there's two ways to approach it there's the morgan household i just watched that video sent over where it's right selfishly you know do uh write for yourself and people will people with your mentality will eventually show up and start reading what you're writing that perspective comes from having figured out who you are and what you want to write about which i think comes from providing a service of some kind or trying to distill an idea or being in an environment where you have to agency and marketing environments are my experience and if you ask me to figure out whether that's like is that who i am like if i was dropped if i was born a thousand times would i end up doing the same thing or is it like something that i found uh like intriguing enough to develop a skill set around and it's it's more of the idea of solving someone's maybe this is too specific of a way to put it but helping someone figure something out or writing something that helps a business owner better explain what they do like that feeling to me is just as satisfying as writing something that i would have wanted to read myself so i think it's it it depends on an individual level what really fires you up but what i identified i think as a thing that i am interesting interested in is um helping people communicate more effectively whether it's like a person or a business or um and the agency environment sort of got me addicted to that that solving of that problem and and where the like huge gap i think came from and when i started to hone in on visualized value was this idea of permissionlessness so we've talked a little bit about this so taking and i don't want anybody to interpret this literally because it would just result in you know you going down the exact same path i went down and that's like the market has been flooded with that approach at this point but taking a um taking somebody's work taking an idea that you appreciate and building on it in some way to contribute the bigger discourse i think is what this is really about and until my mentality shifted from i think that shares some of the some of the same qualities as writing for like being selfish right for yourself because there is something selfish about generating the feeling you get when you help somebody does that make sense like i don't i i definitely feel more um i definitely get more satisfaction from helping somebody understand something or build something than i do from writing something that i want to read like that doesn't resonate with me in the same way as this person has um yeah i'll give a personal example this person has a grandparent who has alzheimer's and they're working on this they discovered some like supplement that helps their grandfather uh better recall information on a day-to-day basis and they want to turn that into a product that other people in that situation can access this the whole in their skill set is branding design marketing all of these things if i can go in and sort of fill that void and up occupy a like play a role in making that happen that to be is is way more satisfying than yeah i think it's approaching it problem first rather than the uh what you want to write about and i think you know there's it's a really complex there's no like very succinct answer for it but that to me is a more anti-fragile way to approach if that makes sense it attracts like freelance opportunities you can turn that into all sorts of opportunity in the meantime and then eventually the pendulum swings where you've refined who you are to the point where you become a magnet if that makes sense jack one more question can you talk a little bit about some of your inspirations i think one person who comes to mind is carl richards i can see a lot of carl richards thinking his aesthetic in your work and you can see that things are pretty similar in terms of how you think and so i'm curious to hear where have you gotten a lot of inspiration and how have you taken the inspiration of others as a launching pad that then have allowed you to tap into your own originality as a creator yeah so carl richards is now a friend of mine and i i must have seen his work at some point and this is another example of like collecting dots subconsciously like in if you ask me to name like designers that i admire i would say like peter rams the the product the brawn product guy uh joseph muller brockman who's a like a swiss graphic designer i must have seen carl richards work somewhere but i did not click until i think he reached out and i was like man i've been ripping this guy off for years and uh he didn't he didn't see it that way but it's incredible how like it's literally an inverse aesthetic he talks a lot about money and uh like mental models and that even the subject matter is super similar right there's a and there are a few people out there that are using like diagrams to explain uh complex ideas and i think it's partially there and it's also the like it came about as partially a necessary thing to win business on the service side so i was trying to win graphic design clients to do things like visualize these sales pitch decks for supply chain companies but putting that in my portfolio and like putting that out on instagram is not going to resonate in the same way that if you take a you know a marcus aurelius quote and add some visual context to it that sort of you kill two birds with one stone in that instance you demonstrate that you visualize ideas um you can take an idea and add visual context to it and you're sort of broadcasting your skill set to would-be clients so it's it was it was half creative expression and half um sort of soliciting for freelance work that that originally created the visualize value template as it were i want to share something i have an idea called imitate and innovate and i just want to share how comedians think about this because i think it's there's a lot of similarities between what you can do as a writer what you can do as a designer and then what we've actually already seen from comedians so check this out but what happens if you can't copy perfectly this was a big epiphany for me and it's that the best thing about copying is that the failure to do so is a success in and out of itself when you do a bad job copying somebody you end up revealing your own voice take for example talk show comedians who have tried to copy their idols failed and then become great themselves so johnny carson tried to copy jack benny but failed and won six emmy awards then david letterman tried to copy johnny carson but failed and became one of america's great television hosts in reflecting on his own influences another comedian conan o'brien said quote it is our failure to become a perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique see all of these comedians learned that imitation reveals our identity especially when we fall short of the people that we admire so i think what's really interesting there is like you can actually tap into imitating other people and often what ends up happening is you find these holes and sort of this resistance in your imitation and then who you eventually become ends up revealing itself and so it's really interesting to hear jack say i've collected all of these dots like i bet if you were to squish all them together they'd be like right next to how jack is but because there's so many of them and because jack has sort of had years of actually doing the work of processing the ideas he ends up with something that's like deeply original almost like when you mix all the different colors together and it ends up as white and you're like how in the world is that possible i think that that's how imitation can then lead to originality yeah i have a ever idea that just struck me as i was watching that video of yours where it's almost like you're staring at something on the horizon so that might be somebody that you're that you're wanting to emulate or somebody that you admire and you wish your work was you know recognized in the same way there's just something about that work that you love so you wanna you wanna follow that person in whether that's creating things or literally uh getting closer to where they are and then you get to the horizon and you see other things so you're like your path is kind of veering with each iteration so you get halfway there and then you see a different direction or there's somebody else that you think or some piece of work you see or a book you read or something that veers you off slightly so you kind of you're in pursuit of this thing but in that pursuit you kind of get distracted along the way and just end up in a totally different place as a result exactly so speaking of imitation i want to start my own presentation with an imitation of sort of what i'm picking up from from jack i've taken a lot from just his own drawings and it's been a blast for me to look at his drawings and then try to basically implement them myself and so what i want to sort of talk about today is get going you're like the little kid playing basketball you get good you're like jordan going up for the slam dunk and so the question is how did i get going as a creator this is where i want to begin jack was talking a little bit about how when he was getting going he had nobody looking at his stuff and for me i was in university at the time and what happened was i was doing some college television and uh here's a clip from my sophomore year welcome back to elon news local news i'm david perrell here with today's sports update it was a busy weekend for elon sports let's begin with the football game in their final meeting it's conference rivals a 1-2 elon team was eager to beat app state for the first time since 1964. okay why are my eyebrows moving like that it makes no sense whatsoever i start off i have the little mistake at the beginning where i have to like re-rehearse it and then when you do um when you do television at the end there's this thing that's called crosstalk listen to how awkward this crosstalk is thanks david now uh let's talk more about uh you on football as a whole one one of the three that's that's not the best start you know it's not the best but coach sweptson insisted that the team was still good they were on a right track and he's proud of their improvement they take on coastal carolina for a matinee game at 1 30. they'll all be home for dinner and the parents will be out supporting the phoenix this weekend well that sounds great i'm so embarrassed but you know what i'm absolutely humiliated but you know what it's funny but that's what got me started that's what i was like as a presenter you know almost a decade ago now and at the time i was like i got to college originally to play college golf and so i tried to start this like golf instruction business uh called top performance golf this was our very first website and uh i took this photo with this this this dslr camera which at the time was the biggest purchase i'd ever made and you know i was writing these blog posts that weren't very good and i was just totally convinced that i was gonna end up working in the golf industry uh we didn't end up going far with this business at all and what then happened though was because i had begun marching down the path of saying hey i'm gonna start a golf business i ended up seeing the world differently and i remember seeing you've probably seen this before it's this disney flywheel and so walt disney drew this i think in 1957 and what this is is it's basically how all of disney as a business would work together how the distribution would deal with the merchandise the merchandise with television television with music he drew this whole thing out and i was like oh my god that is the craziest thing i've ever seen and so i drew one myself this was more than half a decade ago this was the original flywheel that i thought i would build and what's pretty crazy is in some ways it stayed the same in some ways it's totally different like you can see like this is all about uh the golf industry and this is you know what i was really focused on um actually here i guess it had evolved a little bit out of it i was focused on media sports entertainment travel transportation i guess i would monetize through product placement and sponsorships this is what i was thinking at the time and this was the thing i was like incorporate golf at the bottom you know i just didn't know and this book right here is industries of the future you know i was really thinking about the future um but what's also wild is how similar that ended up being and so i went from that flywheel i wrote an academic paper in 2016 called models of internet monetization it was a published paper and what's pretty crazy is that in some ways things are totally different in some ways i've just been focused on this question of models of internet monetization for the last more than half a decade now what came from that is i'm still obsessed with that same question and so it's interesting that both jack and i worked in advertising agencies when we got started what happened was i joined this was took this photo on my first day at an agency called laundry service and i was what's really cool about working in agency is you work with so many different clients that you actually end up getting that 10 000 iterations thing that jack was talking about earlier because you have stuff coming at you all the time and you're always needing to sort of change how you present your product how how you're thinking you actually need to inhabit the mind of your client and unfortunately seven months in i well i found out that people were becoming media companies and seven months in i was laid off and that idea that people were becoming media companies was sort of the core thesis of the company i was laid off and i remembered i remember very vividly being with with my boss and him giving me some feedback and saying you know what you're not a very good writer this was one of the big pieces of feedback i got and i said i want to turn that around so i remember like he's like 6'4 this this this tall guy big beard kind of like one of those sales guys who's pretty intimidating and i was like you know the short short little kid out of college and i remembered looking back at him and saying hey mike how can i become a better writer and i remember him saying just write all the time and read the great writers and try to embody what it is that they do really try to soak up whatever it is that makes them excel i didn't think much of it but i didn't realize that that ended up being the impetus for my drive but being laid off was just brutal and i went years years years without i never reached out to my boss but more on that later and so what i did was i had no idea where i wanted to go so i basically came up with this metaphor called the north star and the north star is called polaris and it's quite bright and it's i think one degree i was talking to an astrophysicist last week i think he said it was one degree off from true north so old sailors they used to look at the north star as sort of how they would calibrate their direction and i said you know what i've no idea what i want to do with my life i'm going to start this thing called the north star so this was my first logo it is horrendous it is absolutely horrendous the website was called northstar.store facebook was huge at the time this was our just main logo it's really flat it's ugly the blue just doesn't look good any normal designer would look at this thing in puke i designed it in like microsoft word or something this was my tagline which is literally the most generic thing ever we help founders realize their vision and achieve their dreams and i mean i don't think that you could write a more corporate and generic tagline if you tried and i remember jack's presentation reminded me of this i remember getting an argument with my mom literal arguments over if we should use we versus i and my mom was like we should use we to make you sound you know bigger and more substantial and i was like but that's lying like it's just me and she's like but no one's gonna hire you if it's just you all these sorts of things and so i lied to the world and i said we and my friends at the time i was starting this i was making these really cringe youtube videos and this was from a recent email from a college friend and this is what he says i can't tell you how many times some of the mutual people we know made fun of your efforts they didn't have respect for what you were working on nor the vision to see what you were working toward and i knew that people were making fun of me it was very hard emotionally to know that that was the case but i kept on pushing through it and one of the game changers for me was a piece called naked brands it must have been the 20th article i published and i couldn't believe it like i couldn't sleep at night i was so excited 6 000 people read this article in a single day and i was just like oh my goodness and the whole thesis of article was that people were becoming companies so i'd been at this agency i'd learned that people were becoming media companies there that was the thesis there i said you know what just strip out media people are becoming companies people like jack they are gonna have their own companies and you know half a decade ago i realized this i turned it all into a piece and i said wow that's that's pretty interesting i'm gonna begin to harvest this idea and at the time though i had to ask how can i find work remember i was laid off they just you know let me go it was 6 p.m on a friday i had 5 minutes to get out of the office and i stormed out and i was like i think got two weeks severance and which at the time i thought was the most generous thing ever and i was like uh oh i'm living in new york city i need to find work and so i started to look at the finance industry and i had some ideas because i had kept writing writing was always the thing that like if i would write writing is like research and development for your mind it's like when you commit to writing for every single day you're like a company that commits having an r d lab because when you write you realize things you begin to invent things that you would have never seen otherwise and i wrote a piece called naked brands the future of finance so i took that original naked brand's piece i wrote one about commerce i wrote one about basketball i wrote one about finance and from this finance one i learned about warren buffett and howard marks and both buffett marks built their names by writing these these annual letters and what they would do is they would basically put their ideas on on the page then other people could see their thinking they could say hey howard marx warren buffett they're really smart i like how they think i want to give my money to them and i said you know what now that media both the production and distribution of media has been democratized there's going to be a huge opportunity for financial advisors to basically start writing on the internet and use twitter to basically build their brands and grow their audiences and this wasn't really me like predicting the future or anything like that this was me just looking at what was happening and basically saying this is actually going to be a way bigger part of the future how can i capitalize on this so what i did was i remember my first ever client was this company called gbm they're a bank in mexico city and they flew me down to mexico to give this presentation and i was like i don't know i i i felt like an absolute king sitting economy class on this this this flight in this dinky little hotel room but you know what i was like i'm the man i'm being flown abroad to talk about goals personal background market shifts industry positioning developing a content strategy and a proposal so they were all excited i was like well transform gbm's content arm all these things this was actually from the hotel i stayed at this was a view the president of mexico lives just behind this flag to the right and this is the big auditorium in mexico city and this was the presentation i gave i flew literally to another country to talk to like 11 people uh but i thought this was just the biggest deal and turns out i didn't do a very good job they never hired me back and um that was the end of that so i was like damn it i didn't do a good job i'm i just don't have a good career here so then i started pitching individual asset managers so i did that you know these were proposals i talked about this naked brands workshop all this stuff that i was just making up and you know trying to say hey maybe this will work and i ended up finally getting a client in sydney australia his name was paul and i did one presentation with him he was all happy about it second presentation he's like you know what this isn't very good and i realized that i didn't know how to communicate my ideas and that my business model of actually trying to do these presentations it just wasn't quite right but you know what i was getting going i'll give myself that credit i just hadn't figured out how to get good and so what i realized was that the world rewards the people who are the best at communicating ideas and not necessarily the best not necessarily the people with the best ideas the world rewards people who are the best at communicating ideas and not necessarily the people with the best ideas and so this then leads into rite of passage which is really my whole professional life now this was the very first outline i made for the course this was november 2018 and this was my original idea the course is an introduction to personal branding the internet has transformed careers networking and friendship and through this course you're going to learn how to use one of the most powerful tools in human history if you know how to use it well it's almost impossible to underestimate the impact the internet can have on your life internet fluency is the ultimate meta skill honestly pretty good for a mission statement i would give this a solid b especially for a first try but i was getting going and you can see on the right we need to hire videographer design the production set and i was just trying to figure all this out i hadn't even come up with some of the main principles in the course like building a personal monopoly or anything like that so what happened was me and my the guy who helped me make the course tiago forte who's still my business partner we went down to mexico city and we hired these two videographers so that's tiago on the left here the two videographers on the right and then here's a shot from looking through the camera and basically what we would do is we went to the basically the mexican starbucks it's called tierra de garat it's a really nice coffee shop and we went there every single day we got this big pen and paper pad and we basically just wrote out the curriculum one new module every single day it was brutal work and you can see us here trying to make sense of everything and what i was really trying to do here and jack this might be a good place if you want to come in and talk about this is i was trying to basically create a sculpture by just getting a bunch of marble on the page so michelangelo said the sculpture is already complete within the marble block before i start my work it's already there i just have to chisel away the superfluous material so what i needed was all the marble and then later i could start chiseling which is really what i've been doing for the past two years i was looking we were looking for the statue inside of my mind we knew it was there but we need to start with marble and then eventually craft the statue and i love this this is of everything jack has made this is my favorite representation of a similar idea i mean i absolutely love that and jack i'm curious to hear what stands out about this for you so i was just uh as you were explaining it there were so many slides i was like man i should have put this in because there's a really great crossover between um you tweeted something this must have been 2 000 it must have been like may last year or something and you you said i would i really want to learn design skills and you tagged me and i was like just quote tweeted that tweet and said who would be up for uh a design course based on the stuff that you see on visualize value great response and had a very similar transition to you it's like a design course was where i started which is similar to your like we're going to help founders achieve their dreams i i was sat down to make the thing i was like where the hell do you even start with a design course right and i think you've accomplished this with uh right a passage but it had to go way narrower so it became how to visualize value so you're like reverse engineering the process of this thing that people already understand what it is the the block of stone was the tweet that went out like we're going to make an education product about design and then refining it to the point where it becomes something specific to a very you know particular strain of design was what needed to happen uh but again another i think another interesting like get going situation i work really well under these circumstances because of the agency background it's like i'm gonna do this and it's gonna be ready in a week and it's like then i just have to figure it out i've announced it people have paid me in some circumstances so i collected like pre-payment and that there's nothing more motivating to me than like having you know people's hard-earned cash and having to deliver a return on that so that for me is like there's a great crossover that i wish i'd made a slide on that but um perhaps i'll uh put a little write a little blog post or do it so what what both jack and i did was we got going by creating marble what we found was that statues were like the statue of david and will do you want to talk about the hall of prisoners i you tell the story better than i do yeah happy too so if you ever go to florence italy the best piece of artwork you can see is michelangelo's statue of david you see it there but most people don't know there's several statues in the hallway leading up to the statue of david that are unfinished halfway out of the marble and halfway in and when i saw this in person i thought what a perfect contrast what a perfect metaphor there's the statue of david it's immaculate hard to believe a human being could create something so uh stunning but contrasted with these half-finished statues still coming out of the marble that excess marble or the worries distractions bad habits that hold us back uh and to continue chiseling away and becoming closer to that perfect ideal vision of what you could be i was really inspired when i saw that and that's the end result if you can get there and just lose the excess through taking action um so that is the hollow prisoner's story it's just a magnificent idea because as you get good what you realize is that then you can refine the details and you then you can look at the statue of david from the distance that everybody sees it but then once you actually begin to look at sculptures and you really begin to go in i mean look at the muscles on the neck look at how they bulge like that the way that sort of the neck leads into the top of the chest and just the detail the way that the the nose is constructed the way the lips move i mean it's magnificent but the thing is you can't start here you have to end here and it was because those creators started with that block of marble and like will so magically said went through the chiseling phase of ugliness only because of that could they create this beauty and so you hear that and then you see what jack made one more time and it comes alive with a totally different meaning it's beautiful and so this brings us back to that theme of get going then get good but how does this apply to writing one of the things that a lot of writers try to do is you'll see so i'm going to show you two two sort of rows of images and a lot of novice writers try to do the top bar i recommend doing the block the bottom bar and we have this this principle in right of passage called get your blurry thumbnail down and here's what it means what a lot of writers try to do is they try to basically it's like the way that a printer prints a photo they try to get every single line be perfect sentence one perfect sentence two perfect sentence three perfect but if you're listening to what jack and i are saying here the way that our stories have gone the way that good writing actually happens the way that marble becomes statue is it actually starts off with everything in a way that's blurry and then over time becomes clarified and so with writing what a lot of people try to do is like i said every single line perfect when it's so much better generally to just get everything on paper dump it down and then once it's there you can actually begin to craft and construct it which is why a lot of people in hollywood they call their first draft just the vomit draft just get it on paper what they're really talking about is that thumbnail on the bottom left which is the blurry thumbnail and so it's that block of marble which you turn into a statue and so i think that we can actually learn a lot from artists and get going and get good is like a sketch so one of my personal favorite artists is edward hopper he painted all of these very serene photos or images of of the american landscape you'll see a lot of these especially like that top one in the middle and then the one on the bottom right these are his urban landscapes and then he paid some painted some rural ones too and this is one of my favorite paintings of his it's called morning sun and you could look at this and you could say oh it's magnificent painting i mean look at the way that light shines onto her legs and this is one of the things that hopper was very good at dealing with light and shadow but you look at something like this and these were hoppers original sketches you can see he's just getting going he's just putting it's like that vomit draft right it is trying to just get the marble to get the original image you can see the different ways that the windows are rotated you can see on the top she is more to the right than she is in the middle hopper is just trying to make sense of what am i going to do with this piece and then hopper begins to actually go in and focus on okay what is her head going to look like what is the shape of her nose how is the roundedness of the back of her head going to look how is it going to interact with the hair then you can see one extra ear on the right we're trying to now make sense of what this piece is going to be like okay now what we're going to do is we're actually going to label all of the different parts of this painting we're going to say this is what's going to be here this is what's going to be there we're actually watching hopper as hopper moves through the construction of this piece going from get going in order to getting good through sketches and ends with this and so it's so easy to look at morning sun and say uh hopper's just more talented than i am but then you begin to look at the sketches the refinement the clarity the focus and you begin to realize that what hopper's doing is just going through step by step and so artists don't turn every sketch into a polished painting not every sketch is worthy of being a polished painting but i think there's a question that we need to ask when you're ready going how do you know when to get good and so i call this the content triangle where you get going by sharing ideas you get good by refining your best ones so i started one of my first articles i think this is my third or fourth one called it's time to disrupt our archaic education system i mean the piece isn't very well written by any means it's a throwaway piece that belongs in the trash can somewhere but the actual idea what i started with getting going with i'm trying to get good at that every single day and will and monica who you see on the screen right now they are a part of helping me get good at this challenge because the problems in education were clear to me but the solutions were not and you'll see this a lot in your journey where there'll be certain issues certain ideas that you realize but then how to actually make how to actually take action and create that vision how to make it happen it's not always obvious to you and so now from that article this is our team this is the team that runs read a passage and together we're getting good at what i started with getting going with when i wrote that first article and then there's twitter of course i mean these were some of my first tweets and they're just atrocious you don't want to use this many hashtags it's just not a compelling tweet at all it's just an image it's like it adds no value to the reader of this tweet whatsoever i mean this one's even worse this one didn't get a single like or a single retweet i could watch this interview over and over and over again hashtag inspiring i mean dude what are you doing but you know what i was getting going and so what i did was i doubled down on what resonated and as jack says you want to do less but better well it's from dieter rams but as jack shows here rather than trying to do all of these things once you're ready to get good you just focus on a couple things and you then get good through that focus and so i watched what people resonated with and i followed this this idea called the content triangle and start with conversation i'd say okay what do people resonate with in conversation i'd share it maybe on twitter then i'd share my email newsletter and then i finally distribute it what i'm doing is i'm getting this constant filtering mechanism this constant feedback to then improve my ideas and so what i'll often do is this is how a lot of my articles begin it'll be like this this little image where they'll be like i have some ideas that are sort of really well figured out and i'll like maybe have a little path 01:0:1,349 --> 01:0:3,119 01:0:1,359 --> 01:0:4,480 or something and i'll be like okay these 01:0:3,109 --> 01:0:4,480 01:0:3,119 --> 01:0:6,720 things are good this is really pretty 01:0:4,470 --> 01:0:6,720 01:0:4,480 --> 01:0:8,880 but i don't really know how i'm gonna 01:0:6,710 --> 01:0:8,880 01:0:6,720 --> 01:0:10,640 fill in the rest of this and so i have 01:0:8,870 --> 01:0:10,640 01:0:8,880 --> 01:0:13,440 like that spark of 01:0:10,630 --> 01:0:13,440 01:0:10,640 --> 01:0:14,960 get going epiphany and then what i'll do 01:0:13,430 --> 01:0:14,960 01:0:13,440 --> 01:0:16,720 is i say okay i have this one part but i 01:0:14,950 --> 01:0:16,720 01:0:14,960 --> 01:0:19,280 need to fill in the whole thing and then 01:0:16,710 --> 01:0:19,280 01:0:16,720 --> 01:0:21,440 i'll go from a tweet into an essay and 01:0:19,270 --> 01:0:21,440 01:0:19,280 --> 01:0:23,200 so i'll take this original image this 01:0:21,430 --> 01:0:23,200 01:0:21,440 --> 01:0:25,359 original idea and i'll turn it into 01:0:23,190 --> 01:0:25,359 01:0:23,200 --> 01:0:27,359 something like this where i go from 01:0:25,349 --> 01:0:27,359 01:0:25,359 --> 01:0:28,559 having the image to then really filling 01:0:27,349 --> 01:0:28,559 01:0:27,359 --> 01:0:31,599 it out and trying to make something 01:0:28,549 --> 01:0:31,599 01:0:28,559 --> 01:0:34,799 really beautiful focused 01:0:31,589 --> 01:0:34,799 01:0:31,599 --> 01:0:37,920 on every single part of the picture that 01:0:34,789 --> 01:0:37,920 01:0:34,799 --> 01:0:39,440 actually comes alive to me as i write 01:0:37,910 --> 01:0:39,440 01:0:37,920 --> 01:0:42,400 and that's actually what happened to me 01:0:39,430 --> 01:0:42,400 01:0:39,440 --> 01:0:44,079 with this this essay lifting alone so i 01:0:42,390 --> 01:0:44,079 01:0:42,400 --> 01:0:46,559 was talking to a friend i published this 01:0:44,069 --> 01:0:46,559 01:0:44,079 --> 01:0:48,480 this week and it's now i think it has 01:0:46,549 --> 01:0:48,480 01:0:46,559 --> 01:0:50,799 almost half a million impressions in two 01:0:48,470 --> 01:0:50,799 01:0:48,480 --> 01:0:52,559 days and the story of how this happened 01:0:50,789 --> 01:0:52,559 01:0:50,799 --> 01:0:55,680 was i was talking to a friend two weeks 01:0:52,549 --> 01:0:55,680 01:0:52,559 --> 01:0:58,079 ago he was about to go to work out i had 01:0:55,670 --> 01:0:58,079 01:0:55,680 --> 01:0:59,359 this idea he said oh that's pretty 01:0:58,069 --> 01:0:59,359 01:0:58,079 --> 01:1:1,040 interesting 01:0:59,349 --> 01:1:1,040 01:0:59,359 --> 01:1:2,480 then i spoke 01:1:1,030 --> 01:1:2,480 01:1:1,040 --> 01:1:4,799 just worked out the idea through 01:1:2,470 --> 01:1:4,799 01:1:2,480 --> 01:1:6,640 conversation with my family last week i 01:1:4,789 --> 01:1:6,640 01:1:4,799 --> 01:1:8,160 was telling my dad about my mom about it 01:1:6,630 --> 01:1:8,160 01:1:6,640 --> 01:1:9,680 and they asked some questions and stuff 01:1:8,150 --> 01:1:9,680 01:1:8,160 --> 01:1:12,079 then i was on the plane from san 01:1:9,670 --> 01:1:12,079 01:1:9,680 --> 01:1:14,319 francisco to austin i wrote it out in my 01:1:12,069 --> 01:1:14,319 01:1:12,079 --> 01:1:16,240 newsletter then like a bunch of people 01:1:14,309 --> 01:1:16,240 01:1:14,319 --> 01:1:18,160 responded to my newsletter 01:1:16,230 --> 01:1:18,160 01:1:16,240 --> 01:1:20,160 01:1:18,150 --> 01:1:20,160 01:1:18,160 --> 01:1:22,319 they said hey 01:1:20,150 --> 01:1:22,319 01:1:20,160 --> 01:1:23,599 you know what this is pretty interesting 01:1:22,309 --> 01:1:23,599 01:1:22,319 --> 01:1:24,400 some people actually shared it on 01:1:23,589 --> 01:1:24,400 01:1:23,599 --> 01:1:26,000 twitter 01:1:24,390 --> 01:1:26,000 01:1:24,400 --> 01:1:27,359 and after i saw people sharing it on 01:1:25,990 --> 01:1:27,359 01:1:26,000 --> 01:1:29,200 twitter i was like you know what i'm 01:1:27,349 --> 01:1:29,200 01:1:27,359 --> 01:1:32,160 gonna polish it up and i'm gonna now 01:1:29,190 --> 01:1:32,160 01:1:29,200 --> 01:1:34,480 turn it into a more polished essay so i 01:1:32,150 --> 01:1:34,480 01:1:32,160 --> 01:1:36,319 live my life in the way that this 01:1:34,470 --> 01:1:36,319 01:1:34,480 --> 01:1:38,240 content triangle happens 01:1:36,309 --> 01:1:38,240 01:1:36,319 --> 01:1:39,760 and this content triangle is the 01:1:38,230 --> 01:1:39,760 01:1:38,240 --> 01:1:42,160 systematization 01:1:39,750 --> 01:1:42,160 01:1:39,760 --> 01:1:43,920 of get going then get good 01:1:42,150 --> 01:1:43,920 01:1:42,160 --> 01:1:46,000 and that's how i get from these original 01:1:43,910 --> 01:1:46,000 01:1:43,920 --> 01:1:48,079 ideas into these pretty images these 01:1:45,990 --> 01:1:48,079 01:1:46,000 --> 01:1:50,480 pretty ideas and so writing from 01:1:48,069 --> 01:1:50,480 01:1:48,079 --> 01:1:52,640 conversation is one of writer passages 01:1:50,470 --> 01:1:52,640 01:1:50,480 --> 01:1:56,079 core ideas and that's why the course is 01:1:52,630 --> 01:1:56,079 01:1:52,640 --> 01:1:57,440 such a social experience that's why my 01:1:56,069 --> 01:1:57,440 01:1:56,079 --> 01:1:59,359 way of thinking about writing is rather 01:1:57,430 --> 01:1:59,359 01:1:57,440 --> 01:2:1,599 than like be alone in a room by yourself 01:1:59,349 --> 01:2:1,599 01:1:59,359 --> 01:2:3,039 no like surround yourself with people 01:2:1,589 --> 01:2:3,039 01:2:1,599 --> 01:2:5,359 actually embrace intellectual 01:2:3,029 --> 01:2:5,359 01:2:3,039 --> 01:2:7,359 conversation and then in that process 01:2:5,349 --> 01:2:7,359 01:2:5,359 --> 01:2:8,720 you end up coming up with good ideas and 01:2:7,349 --> 01:2:8,720 01:2:7,359 --> 01:2:10,079 having realizations that you wouldn't 01:2:8,710 --> 01:2:10,079 01:2:8,720 --> 01:2:12,480 have otherwise 01:2:10,069 --> 01:2:12,480 01:2:10,079 --> 01:2:14,640 and so when you get going progress can 01:2:12,470 --> 01:2:14,640 01:2:12,480 --> 01:2:17,680 be slower than you want so here is my 01:2:14,630 --> 01:2:17,680 01:2:14,640 --> 01:2:21,839 actual twitter growth and you'll see 01:2:17,670 --> 01:2:21,839 01:2:17,680 --> 01:2:26,079 i started in well i started in 2017 with 01:2:21,829 --> 01:2:26,079 01:2:21,839 --> 01:2:27,839 200 ended with 500 2 000 10 000 10 00 30 01:2:26,069 --> 01:2:27,839 01:2:26,079 --> 01:2:29,680 000 and then 01:2:27,829 --> 01:2:29,680 01:2:27,839 --> 01:2:32,480 what happened was 01:2:29,670 --> 01:2:32,480 01:2:29,680 --> 01:2:35,200 i just popped in 2020 01:2:32,470 --> 01:2:35,200 01:2:32,480 --> 01:2:37,599 up to above 140 000 but you can see i 01:2:35,190 --> 01:2:37,599 01:2:35,200 --> 01:2:39,920 started in like 2013 01:2:37,589 --> 01:2:39,920 01:2:37,599 --> 01:2:44,000 and i was basically asymptotic along the 01:2:39,910 --> 01:2:44,000 01:2:39,920 --> 01:2:46,000 x-axis i wasn't going anywhere and then 01:2:43,990 --> 01:2:46,000 01:2:44,000 --> 01:2:47,520 i began to figure it out 01:2:45,990 --> 01:2:47,520 01:2:46,000 --> 01:2:49,599 oh and then remember my original 01:2:47,510 --> 01:2:49,599 01:2:47,520 --> 01:2:52,400 business model well 01:2:49,589 --> 01:2:52,400 01:2:49,599 --> 01:2:54,480 that ended up figuring it itself out too 01:2:52,390 --> 01:2:54,480 01:2:52,400 --> 01:2:57,280 and so what can we learn 01:2:54,470 --> 01:2:57,280 01:2:54,480 --> 01:2:58,720 from these principles 01:2:57,270 --> 01:2:58,720 01:2:57,280 --> 01:3:1,359 i think that there's three things 01:2:58,710 --> 01:3:1,359 01:2:58,720 --> 01:3:3,359 inspiration perspiration and observation 01:3:1,349 --> 01:3:3,359 01:3:1,359 --> 01:3:5,359 these are sort of the three elements of 01:3:3,349 --> 01:3:5,359 01:3:3,359 --> 01:3:7,200 get going then get good and so 01:3:5,349 --> 01:3:7,200 01:3:5,359 --> 01:3:9,039 inspiration is that the seeds are 01:3:7,190 --> 01:3:9,039 01:3:7,200 --> 01:3:11,520 planted early 01:3:9,029 --> 01:3:11,520 01:3:9,039 --> 01:3:13,760 and so what this means is i had that 01:3:11,510 --> 01:3:13,760 01:3:11,520 --> 01:3:15,520 original business model from disney i 01:3:13,750 --> 01:3:15,520 01:3:13,760 --> 01:3:17,680 drew it like this and that original 01:3:15,510 --> 01:3:17,680 01:3:15,520 --> 01:3:19,599 business model this is what i have now 01:3:17,670 --> 01:3:19,599 01:3:17,680 --> 01:3:21,280 well you know when i first drew it i 01:3:19,589 --> 01:3:21,280 01:3:19,599 --> 01:3:23,760 didn't really have email now email's the 01:3:21,270 --> 01:3:23,760 01:3:21,280 --> 01:3:26,319 nucleus of everything i do and now 01:3:23,750 --> 01:3:26,319 01:3:23,760 --> 01:3:28,079 with the writing school between thiago 01:3:26,309 --> 01:3:28,079 01:3:26,319 --> 01:3:30,400 and myself we'll do 01:3:28,069 --> 01:3:30,400 01:3:28,079 --> 01:3:32,480 more than 3 000 students next year 01:3:30,390 --> 01:3:32,480 01:3:30,400 --> 01:3:34,480 between second brain and rite of passage 01:3:32,470 --> 01:3:34,480 01:3:32,480 --> 01:3:37,039 and our cohorts now are 01:3:34,470 --> 01:3:37,039 01:3:34,480 --> 01:3:39,119 about 350 new students which and then 01:3:37,029 --> 01:3:39,119 01:3:37,039 --> 01:3:41,280 about 150 returning alums we're doing 01:3:39,109 --> 01:3:41,280 01:3:39,119 --> 01:3:43,680 almost 500 students in many of our 01:3:41,270 --> 01:3:43,680 01:3:41,280 --> 01:3:46,240 cohorts i never expected that that was 01:3:43,670 --> 01:3:46,240 01:3:43,680 --> 01:3:47,760 an emergent process of what happened and 01:3:46,230 --> 01:3:47,760 01:3:46,240 --> 01:3:49,520 becoming an investor i've now invested 01:3:47,750 --> 01:3:49,520 01:3:47,760 --> 01:3:51,440 in double-digit companies i would have 01:3:49,510 --> 01:3:51,440 01:3:49,520 --> 01:3:54,319 never expected that 01:3:51,430 --> 01:3:54,319 01:3:51,440 --> 01:3:56,319 and so while others see a straight line 01:3:54,309 --> 01:3:56,319 01:3:54,319 --> 01:3:58,160 you as the creator you end up seeing the 01:3:56,309 --> 01:3:58,160 01:3:56,319 --> 01:3:59,680 winding path and i've tried to sort of 01:3:58,150 --> 01:3:59,680 01:3:58,160 --> 01:4:1,760 share with you what that winding path 01:3:59,670 --> 01:4:1,760 01:3:59,680 --> 01:4:4,240 looks like other people think oh you 01:4:1,750 --> 01:4:4,240 01:4:1,760 --> 01:4:6,240 know what david just had this idea then 01:4:4,230 --> 01:4:6,240 01:4:4,240 --> 01:4:8,640 he started write a passage it was just 01:4:6,230 --> 01:4:8,640 01:4:6,240 --> 01:4:9,839 that and that's how it worked out but 01:4:8,630 --> 01:4:9,839 01:4:8,640 --> 01:4:12,480 the truth is 01:4:9,829 --> 01:4:12,480 01:4:9,839 --> 01:4:13,839 for years i was truly struggling as a 01:4:12,470 --> 01:4:13,839 01:4:12,480 --> 01:4:15,599 writer i was struggling as a creator i 01:4:13,829 --> 01:4:15,599 01:4:13,839 --> 01:4:17,920 was struggling to build a business and 01:4:15,589 --> 01:4:17,920 01:4:15,599 --> 01:4:20,960 so what actually happened was that 01:4:17,910 --> 01:4:20,960 01:4:17,920 --> 01:4:22,480 reality for me was a lot more curved and 01:4:20,950 --> 01:4:22,480 01:4:20,960 --> 01:4:24,640 there were all these actuaries that were 01:4:22,470 --> 01:4:24,640 01:4:22,480 --> 01:4:26,799 actually dead ends to nowhere and 01:4:24,630 --> 01:4:26,799 01:4:24,640 --> 01:4:29,200 writing is the same way so 01:4:26,789 --> 01:4:29,200 01:4:26,799 --> 01:4:32,240 when you write in order to write well 01:4:29,190 --> 01:4:32,240 01:4:29,200 --> 01:4:33,359 what you actually want to do is show 01:4:32,230 --> 01:4:33,359 01:4:32,240 --> 01:4:36,079 how 01:4:33,349 --> 01:4:36,079 01:4:33,359 --> 01:4:37,680 arriving at an idea was much more of a 01:4:36,069 --> 01:4:37,680 01:4:36,079 --> 01:4:39,280 process of meandering and you want to 01:4:37,670 --> 01:4:39,280 01:4:37,680 --> 01:4:40,559 balance the straightness and the 01:4:39,270 --> 01:4:40,559 01:4:39,280 --> 01:4:42,960 meandering so let me show you what i 01:4:40,549 --> 01:4:42,960 01:4:40,559 --> 01:4:44,720 mean by that 01:4:42,950 --> 01:4:44,720 01:4:42,960 --> 01:4:46,640 writing is harder than it looks because 01:4:44,710 --> 01:4:46,640 01:4:44,720 --> 01:4:48,400 readers think that a writer just took a 01:4:46,630 --> 01:4:48,400 01:4:46,640 --> 01:4:50,559 straight line from the genesis of an 01:4:48,390 --> 01:4:50,559 01:4:48,400 --> 01:4:53,039 idea to its final form but in reality 01:4:50,549 --> 01:4:53,039 01:4:50,559 --> 01:4:56,079 the writer has to go through all these 01:4:53,029 --> 01:4:56,079 01:4:53,039 --> 01:4:58,559 dead ends in order to develop what 01:4:56,069 --> 01:4:58,559 01:4:56,079 --> 01:5:1,280 eventually becomes the final piece so 01:4:58,549 --> 01:5:1,280 01:4:58,559 --> 01:5:4,000 this is why an idea is like a river in 01:5:1,270 --> 01:5:4,000 01:5:1,280 --> 01:5:5,760 order to go from the beginning to the 01:5:3,990 --> 01:5:5,760 01:5:4,000 --> 01:5:7,440 end you don't go in a straight line you 01:5:5,750 --> 01:5:7,440 01:5:5,760 --> 01:5:9,680 sort of journey all over the place and 01:5:7,430 --> 01:5:9,680 01:5:7,440 --> 01:5:12,160 also you end up at all these 01:5:9,670 --> 01:5:12,160 01:5:9,680 --> 01:5:13,760 dead ends and in order to find where 01:5:12,150 --> 01:5:13,760 01:5:12,160 --> 01:5:17,039 you're going you have to follow this 01:5:13,750 --> 01:5:17,039 01:5:13,760 --> 01:5:19,359 compass of intuition and i think that as 01:5:17,029 --> 01:5:19,359 01:5:17,039 --> 01:5:22,160 a writer you want to give some of that 01:5:19,349 --> 01:5:22,160 01:5:19,359 --> 01:5:23,039 experience to your reader you want them 01:5:22,150 --> 01:5:23,039 01:5:22,160 --> 01:5:25,359 01:5:23,029 --> 01:5:25,359 01:5:23,039 --> 01:5:26,960 feel what it was like to discover an 01:5:25,349 --> 01:5:26,960 01:5:25,359 --> 01:5:28,880 idea in a way that's fun and you want to 01:5:26,950 --> 01:5:28,880 01:5:26,960 --> 01:5:32,000 give them a little bit of the scenic 01:5:28,870 --> 01:5:32,000 01:5:28,880 --> 01:5:33,839 route but if you meander all over the 01:5:31,990 --> 01:5:33,839 01:5:32,000 --> 01:5:36,880 place then you're not giving the reader 01:5:33,829 --> 01:5:36,880 01:5:33,839 --> 01:5:38,240 the sense of urgency that is a part of 01:5:36,870 --> 01:5:38,240 01:5:36,880 --> 01:5:39,599 all good writing 01:5:38,230 --> 01:5:39,599 01:5:38,240 --> 01:5:41,839 so what you want to do is you want to 01:5:39,589 --> 01:5:41,839 01:5:39,599 --> 01:5:43,680 balance that sense of urgency and you 01:5:41,829 --> 01:5:43,680 01:5:41,839 --> 01:5:46,079 also want to balance that sort of scenic 01:5:43,670 --> 01:5:46,079 01:5:43,680 --> 01:5:47,520 route and i think that this is what it 01:5:46,069 --> 01:5:47,520 01:5:46,079 --> 01:5:48,960 looks like where 01:5:47,510 --> 01:5:48,960 01:5:47,520 --> 01:5:50,880 you don't want to take people through 01:5:48,950 --> 01:5:50,880 01:5:48,960 --> 01:5:52,880 every single actuary you want writing to 01:5:50,870 --> 01:5:52,880 01:5:50,880 --> 01:5:55,119 really just be this purple line you want 01:5:52,870 --> 01:5:55,119 01:5:52,880 --> 01:5:56,640 to basically go from point a to point b 01:5:55,109 --> 01:5:56,640 01:5:55,119 --> 01:5:58,559 but sometimes if it's just a straight 01:5:56,630 --> 01:5:58,559 01:5:56,640 --> 01:6:0,559 line it just sounds trite you actually 01:5:58,549 --> 01:6:0,559 01:5:58,559 --> 01:6:2,400 need to this is what it means to wrap 01:6:0,549 --> 01:6:2,400 01:6:0,559 --> 01:6:4,000 your ideas and story this is what it 01:6:2,390 --> 01:6:4,000 01:6:2,400 --> 01:6:6,240 means to wrap your ideas and humors 01:6:3,990 --> 01:6:6,240 01:6:4,000 --> 01:6:7,599 there's setups before the punchline 01:6:6,230 --> 01:6:7,599 01:6:6,240 --> 01:6:10,640 because often if you just have the 01:6:7,589 --> 01:6:10,640 01:6:7,599 --> 01:6:13,200 punchline the joke isn't nearly as funny 01:6:10,630 --> 01:6:13,200 01:6:10,640 --> 01:6:15,119 and writing is similar you actually want 01:6:13,190 --> 01:6:15,119 01:6:13,200 --> 01:6:17,599 some of your meandering 01:6:15,109 --> 01:6:17,599 01:6:15,119 --> 01:6:20,160 and the second thing from inspiration 01:6:17,589 --> 01:6:20,160 01:6:17,599 --> 01:6:22,079 now into perspiration where the 01:6:20,150 --> 01:6:22,079 01:6:20,160 --> 01:6:24,400 obscurity that you face when you first 01:6:22,069 --> 01:6:24,400 01:6:22,079 --> 01:6:26,559 start getting going that is actually a 01:6:24,390 --> 01:6:26,559 01:6:24,400 --> 01:6:30,000 good thing young ideas should be 01:6:26,549 --> 01:6:30,000 01:6:26,559 --> 01:6:31,200 protected with obscurity and i think 01:6:29,990 --> 01:6:31,200 01:6:30,000 --> 01:6:33,760 01:6:31,190 --> 01:6:33,760 01:6:31,200 --> 01:6:35,599 they actually need to be cocooned from 01:6:33,750 --> 01:6:35,599 01:6:33,760 --> 01:6:37,520 the tyranny of judgment when you first 01:6:35,589 --> 01:6:37,520 01:6:35,599 --> 01:6:40,240 come up with an idea 01:6:37,510 --> 01:6:40,240 01:6:37,520 --> 01:6:42,640 it's very fragile it's very precious and 01:6:40,230 --> 01:6:42,640 01:6:40,240 --> 01:6:45,599 if you have the criticism of a bunch of 01:6:42,630 --> 01:6:45,599 01:6:42,640 --> 01:6:47,359 people who are coming at you you don't 01:6:45,589 --> 01:6:47,359 01:6:45,599 --> 01:6:49,680 actually have the 01:6:47,349 --> 01:6:49,680 01:6:47,359 --> 01:6:51,599 emotional armor to deal with it when 01:6:49,670 --> 01:6:51,599 01:6:49,680 --> 01:6:53,599 you're first starting and you also need 01:6:51,589 --> 01:6:53,599 01:6:51,599 --> 01:6:56,240 some intellectual safety to begin to 01:6:53,589 --> 01:6:56,240 01:6:53,599 --> 01:6:58,640 find your way and experiment with 01:6:56,230 --> 01:6:58,640 01:6:56,240 --> 01:7:1,119 who are you as a creator and who aren't 01:6:58,630 --> 01:7:1,119 01:6:58,640 --> 01:7:2,799 you as a creator and obscurity is the 01:7:1,109 --> 01:7:2,799 01:7:1,119 --> 01:7:5,440 shelter that you need in order to do 01:7:2,789 --> 01:7:5,440 01:7:2,799 --> 01:7:7,280 that and there's a great line from 01:7:5,430 --> 01:7:7,280 01:7:5,440 --> 01:7:9,359 johnny ive where 01:7:7,270 --> 01:7:9,359 01:7:7,280 --> 01:7:10,480 when at steve jobs funeral he was 01:7:9,349 --> 01:7:10,480 01:7:9,359 --> 01:7:12,880 speaking 01:7:10,470 --> 01:7:12,880 01:7:10,480 --> 01:7:15,359 and johnny ive was the director of 01:7:12,870 --> 01:7:15,359 01:7:12,880 --> 01:7:17,680 design for apple for many years and was 01:7:15,349 --> 01:7:17,680 01:7:15,359 --> 01:7:18,799 one of steve jobs very closest friends 01:7:17,670 --> 01:7:18,799 01:7:17,680 --> 01:7:21,359 and he says 01:7:18,789 --> 01:7:21,359 01:7:18,799 --> 01:7:23,359 i think that steve jobs better than 01:7:21,349 --> 01:7:23,359 01:7:21,359 --> 01:7:26,400 anyone understood that while ideas 01:7:23,349 --> 01:7:26,400 01:7:23,359 --> 01:7:29,680 ultimately can be so powerful 01:7:26,390 --> 01:7:29,680 01:7:26,400 --> 01:7:33,119 they begin as fragile barely form 01:7:29,670 --> 01:7:33,119 01:7:29,680 --> 01:7:34,720 thoughts so easily squashed 01:7:33,109 --> 01:7:34,720 01:7:33,119 --> 01:7:37,599 and what 01:7:34,710 --> 01:7:37,599 01:7:34,720 --> 01:7:39,440 jobs and what johnny ive understood was 01:7:37,589 --> 01:7:39,440 01:7:37,599 --> 01:7:42,079 that at the beginning ideas were like 01:7:39,430 --> 01:7:42,079 01:7:39,440 --> 01:7:45,039 these eggs they needed to be protected 01:7:42,069 --> 01:7:45,039 01:7:42,079 --> 01:7:47,039 by this sort of gate almost like a bird 01:7:45,029 --> 01:7:47,039 01:7:45,039 --> 01:7:48,559 and you need to protect 01:7:47,029 --> 01:7:48,559 01:7:47,039 --> 01:7:49,680 these young ideas because they're so 01:7:48,549 --> 01:7:49,680 01:7:48,559 --> 01:7:51,680 fragile 01:7:49,670 --> 01:7:51,680 01:7:49,680 --> 01:7:53,119 and then little ideas 01:7:51,670 --> 01:7:53,119 01:7:51,680 --> 01:7:55,839 they still need to be protected they're 01:7:53,109 --> 01:7:55,839 01:7:53,119 --> 01:7:57,200 just small and only time 01:7:55,829 --> 01:7:57,200 01:7:55,839 --> 01:7:59,520 with time 01:7:57,190 --> 01:7:59,520 01:7:57,200 --> 01:8:1,839 and detention and care and shelter and 01:7:59,510 --> 01:8:1,839 01:7:59,520 --> 01:8:3,599 safety can they begin to fly and as they 01:8:1,829 --> 01:8:3,599 01:8:1,839 --> 01:8:5,599 fly they get bigger 01:8:3,589 --> 01:8:5,599 01:8:3,599 --> 01:8:6,799 and bigger 01:8:5,589 --> 01:8:6,799 01:8:5,599 --> 01:8:8,559 01:8:6,789 --> 01:8:8,559 01:8:6,799 --> 01:8:10,480 until eventually they've grown up and 01:8:8,549 --> 01:8:10,480 01:8:8,559 --> 01:8:12,240 now you can see the entire 01:8:10,470 --> 01:8:12,240 01:8:10,480 --> 01:8:15,359 journey from the fragile protection of 01:8:12,230 --> 01:8:15,359 01:8:12,240 --> 01:8:17,759 eggs into the soaring bird 01:8:15,349 --> 01:8:17,759 01:8:15,359 --> 01:8:18,960 and this is what obscurity gives you you 01:8:17,749 --> 01:8:18,960 01:8:17,759 --> 01:8:22,080 know a lot of people fight that 01:8:18,950 --> 01:8:22,080 01:8:18,960 --> 01:8:24,000 obscurity why is nobody reading my stuff 01:8:22,070 --> 01:8:24,000 01:8:22,080 --> 01:8:26,640 why do i post stuff and i hear nothing 01:8:23,990 --> 01:8:26,640 01:8:24,000 --> 01:8:29,279 but the crickets of indifference what 01:8:26,630 --> 01:8:29,279 01:8:26,640 --> 01:8:31,679 what what is going on here i'm so angry 01:8:29,269 --> 01:8:31,679 01:8:29,279 --> 01:8:33,359 i'm so mad when in fact 01:8:31,669 --> 01:8:33,359 01:8:31,679 --> 01:8:35,279 this is often 01:8:33,349 --> 01:8:35,279 01:8:33,359 --> 01:8:37,440 what you need in order to find who you 01:8:35,269 --> 01:8:37,440 01:8:35,279 --> 01:8:39,600 are as a creative because your original 01:8:37,430 --> 01:8:39,600 01:8:37,440 --> 01:8:41,199 work isn't that good and i'm going to 01:8:39,590 --> 01:8:41,199 01:8:39,600 --> 01:8:43,679 get to that in a second 01:8:41,189 --> 01:8:43,679 01:8:41,199 --> 01:8:46,319 you need space to find your voice and 01:8:43,669 --> 01:8:46,319 01:8:43,679 --> 01:8:49,359 obscurity helps you fight through the 01:8:46,309 --> 01:8:49,359 01:8:46,319 --> 01:8:51,359 taste gap this is an idea from ira glass 01:8:49,349 --> 01:8:51,359 01:8:49,359 --> 01:8:53,040 it is one of the very most important 01:8:51,349 --> 01:8:53,040 01:8:51,359 --> 01:8:54,880 things that i think every creator needs 01:8:53,030 --> 01:8:54,880 01:8:53,040 --> 01:8:57,520 to hear this video is about a minute and 01:8:54,870 --> 01:8:57,520 01:8:54,880 --> 01:8:58,719 a half long but it's absolutely 01:8:57,510 --> 01:8:58,719 01:8:57,520 --> 01:9:0,560 excellent 01:8:58,709 --> 01:9:0,560 01:8:58,719 --> 01:9:3,120 and i think it speaks better than 01:9:0,550 --> 01:9:3,120 01:9:0,560 --> 01:9:6,199 anything i've ever seen to the benefits 01:9:3,110 --> 01:9:6,199 01:9:3,120 --> 01:9:6,199 of obscurity 01:9:6,550 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:9:6,560 --> 01:9:11,120 nobody uh tells people who are beginners 01:9:9,749 --> 01:9:11,120 01:9:9,759 --> 01:9:12,080 and i really or somebody had told this 01:9:11,110 --> 01:9:12,080 01:9:11,120 --> 01:9:14,000 to me 01:9:12,070 --> 01:9:14,000 01:9:12,080 --> 01:9:15,679 is that um all of us who do creative 01:9:13,990 --> 01:9:15,679 01:9:14,000 --> 01:9:17,359 work like you know we get into it and we 01:9:15,669 --> 01:9:17,359 01:9:15,679 --> 01:9:19,199 get into it because we have good taste 01:9:17,349 --> 01:9:19,199 01:9:17,359 --> 01:9:20,560 but it's like there's a gap that for the 01:9:19,189 --> 01:9:20,560 01:9:19,199 --> 01:9:21,839 first couple years that you're making 01:9:20,550 --> 01:9:21,839 01:9:20,560 --> 01:9:23,759 stuff 01:9:21,829 --> 01:9:23,759 01:9:21,839 --> 01:9:25,679 what you're making isn't so good okay 01:9:23,749 --> 01:9:25,679 01:9:23,759 --> 01:9:26,960 it's not that great it's it's trying to 01:9:25,669 --> 01:9:26,960 01:9:25,679 --> 01:9:29,440 be good it has ambition to go but it's 01:9:26,950 --> 01:9:29,440 01:9:26,960 --> 01:9:30,880 not quite that good but your taste the 01:9:29,430 --> 01:9:30,880 01:9:29,440 --> 01:9:32,560 thing that got you into the game 01:9:30,870 --> 01:9:32,560 01:9:30,880 --> 01:9:34,239 your taste is still killer and your 01:9:32,550 --> 01:9:34,239 01:9:32,560 --> 01:9:35,839 taste is good enough that you can tell 01:9:34,229 --> 01:9:35,839 01:9:34,239 --> 01:9:37,279 that what you're making is kind of a 01:9:35,829 --> 01:9:37,279 01:9:35,839 --> 01:9:38,319 disappointment to you you know what i 01:9:37,269 --> 01:9:38,319 01:9:37,279 --> 01:9:39,600 mean 01:9:38,309 --> 01:9:39,600 01:9:38,319 --> 01:9:40,960 a lot of people never get past that 01:9:39,590 --> 01:9:40,960 01:9:39,600 --> 01:9:41,839 phase a lot of people at that point they 01:9:40,950 --> 01:9:41,839 01:9:40,960 --> 01:9:43,679 quit 01:9:41,829 --> 01:9:43,679 01:9:41,839 --> 01:9:46,000 and the thing i would just like say to 01:9:43,669 --> 01:9:46,000 01:9:43,679 --> 01:9:48,719 you with all my heart is that 01:9:45,990 --> 01:9:48,719 01:9:46,000 --> 01:9:50,480 most everybody i know who does 01:9:48,709 --> 01:9:50,480 01:9:48,719 --> 01:9:53,120 interesting creative work they went 01:9:50,470 --> 01:9:53,120 01:9:50,480 --> 01:9:54,400 through a phase of years where they had 01:9:53,110 --> 01:9:54,400 01:9:53,120 --> 01:9:55,840 really good taste they could tell what 01:9:54,390 --> 01:9:55,840 01:9:54,400 --> 01:9:57,920 they were making wasn't as good as they 01:9:55,830 --> 01:9:57,920 01:9:55,840 --> 01:9:59,760 wanted it to be they knew it felt short 01:9:57,910 --> 01:9:59,760 01:9:57,920 --> 01:10:1,199 it didn't have this special thing that 01:9:59,750 --> 01:10:1,199 01:9:59,760 --> 01:10:2,960 we wanted it to have and the thing i would say to you is everybody goes through that and for you to go through it if you're going through right now if you're just getting out of that phase you got to know it's totally normal and the most important possible thing you could do is do a lot of work do a huge volume of work put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you're going to finish one story because it's only by actually going through a volume of work that you're actually going to catch up and close that gap and your the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions in my case like i i took longer to figure out how to do this than anybody i've ever met it takes a while it's going to take you a while it's normal to take a while and you just have to fight your way through that okay i mean i love that i think that that is i mean ira glass is one of the most successful podcasters in the world he hosts this american life and this is what you see is that when you start there's this gap between quality and taste and your taste goes up slowly and then your quality you finally begin to figure it out and it's almost asymptotic towards that taste you never quite get there but you get closer and closer as you get good and this gap this frustration this is what we all feel when we start and as creators we need to know that like we as hourglass says we got into the game because we had good taste but jack and i were both tweeting stuff that was absolute garbage when we started and we still kept on fighting through it we still went through that get going phase i mean mr eyebrows over here with that original elon local news clip i mean it's humiliating it's no good and it's about keep going so that you can get those iterations and then finally observation as jack says make noise and listen for signal so this is about actually listening to the world what is it telling you the great american writer 50 cent once said the audience is always right when people don't respond to what you do they're telling you something loud and clear you're just not listening and i think that this is the final point that i want to make here that it's not just about banging your head against the wall and just doing a bunch of iterations it's about the iteration and the listening the call and the response actually listening to what people are saying what they're telling you and it's okay to have all of these exes it's okay to have failure after failure but eventually if you get to a point where you're making noise and you're listening for a signal you end up having that success and you end up finding that check box which then you can double down on for me that was writing for jack that was design and speaking of check boxes a couple cool things to share last week the guy who ended up laying me off at laundry service reached out to me with just an incredible note hey buddy just a quick note to say i'm so happy for all the success you've had you should be extremely proud of yourself sometimes it just takes years sometimes it takes years to get to a place where some of the people who were hard on you at the beginning the people who gave you the inspiration end up having the validation for you at the end for me this was more than half a decade and next time we're i'm in new york we're going to get together which i'm just really excited for um and then also remember that college friend from the beginning the guy who said that everyone was mocking me i mean he reached out to me too and just said really nice things like you are proof that pushing boundaries and exploring unconventional paths can be rewarding with enough perseverance and you now know the principle here jack and i have opened it up for for you in total which is get going then get good so before we go into the q a if you liked this fast-paced style of presentation the next round of passage opens up on september 8th and enrollment opens on august 23rd this is this is what it's like hundreds of people who are just obsessed with the craft of creating online becoming better writers becoming citizens of the internet and it is just a place where you're gonna find a level of obsession and a level of dedication that you won't find many other places on the internet and especially when it comes to people who want to build their audiences and explore all the nuances with the craft of online writing all right dave do you want to jump into some q a what are you feeling yeah let's do it let's do a q a until the bottom of the hour so have a handful of questions here please keep adding questions to the chat as well uh most common question we got this several different uh varieties but basically it's where to get started right you're talking about all these things get going then to get good but people have different interests several things like writing designing coding how do you know where to start that's people's biggest challenge it seems well i'll give advice based on my personal experience so i think the idea of you can either do this with you can seek permission to do this or you can do it without permission and i think it depends on level of experience you have already so in the case of design for me i was in environments with mentors who like put problems in front of me based on three years of design school and i think there is a there's definitely a strong narrative around you know you don't need to go you don't need a degree to succeed in an internet economy and while that is true i think this idea of developing a skill in a community of some sort is powerful yeah i think i think places like visualize value right of passage um if you're not going to go and spend you know i'm going to shill our own stuff here talk in the book but the idea of building a skill set in complete solitude without um without support is really difficult and unless you have the like i i haven't heard that idea of david's with the what would you call a day with the egg and the like the fragile ideas and stuff yeah the the ability to share fragile ideas and community and there are definitely places on the internet you can go and find that there are still places you can go and do that in person and i think there is you know maybe we've over indexed in some respects on how long you should spend doing that before you expect to get a return on your effort and energy um but i think the advice would depend on where you are in the journey if you're at a stage where you can produce something that solves someone's problem then i've spent a lot of time thinking about this idea of permissionless apprenticeships so i'd say just go out and build things post things solve people's problems if you're at the beginning of the experience curve then find a community that you can develop a skill alongside and then um you know you'll go out into the world and figure out ways to apply that in in new and interesting ways yeah one of the i mean i would say just broadly right of passage is a five-week answer to this question so i've spent years thinking about how do i wish i would have started but i think that if you're not if you don't feel ready for to purchase something to help you i would say find a group of people who can hold you accountable for writing consistently or for creating consistently in whatever it is that you do make sure that you're publishing in public and not just hoarding the ideas for yourself because for two reasons the first is remember principle number three observation listen for signal if you don't publish in public you won't have a sense for what resonates with people and you won't know what you want to double down on you'll actually find once you create online that your intuition for what is really going to hit is actually surprisingly bad so you'll publish a bunch of ideas and it's actually very hard to predict what's going to pop and you want to double down on those things so that can only come if you are publishing in public and the second benefit of being public with your ideas is it's like inviting people to your house you notice how whenever guests are coming over to your house you're always about 10 to 20 percent tidier the same thing happens with creative work once you publish ideas and you share them with other people the quality of your work improves because you know that other others are going to see it so i would say find a cat find an accountability group accountability group write in public and if you can do those two things then you'll be on your way to getting good interesting question here uh how much is too much tweeting once a day once a week and i think there's maybe a question behind the question there about you know what people are thinking about you when you're starting creating uh and how many iterations you should be thinking about early on in this process so love to hear your thoughts on that i have an idea or a model around this that's specific to me so i the volume of tweets that i sent increased after i had sort of put in the work to build assets that those tweets helped grow so once i developed a couple curriculums and like thought through in depth twitter as a vehicle became like the main way to direct attention to those curriculums but i think if i'd spent all of if i hadn't if that effort didn't flip in the first place then those tweets don't have the depth to um it's kind of this barbell strategy right you have these um you have these very deep developed assets in the same way that you know writer passage functions as a asset and the essays on david's blog function as an asset and those tweets almost like front doors to those other assets so i think there's like i would think about it as the front cover of a of a book or an essay or things of that nature so loose rule of thumb like tweeting 30 times a day if you're not um also you know writing an essay a day or iterating on a product that you've built feels too much on the fl like flighty side of things versus you know maybe do three hours of deep work which for me personally the best material the best condensed material comes from that process of getting your head stuck into something for a couple of hours and then maybe a line comes out of that that summarizes the idea and you can you know direct people's attention to this other asset so that's kind of i mean there's not a very specific answer to the question i think it's very dependent on the situation and there's definitely benefit to switching between those two modes of like very succinct um summarizations of how you think and a lot of that you will you will tweet more compelling thoughts if you've gone through that process of writing out your ideas in full too so there's a relationship between those two things if the tldr of that very long-winded answer makes sense another question about the early on days of becoming a creator just ways that you all got feedback where they're just go to people family friends you know if you don't have a big audience but you want to do iterations like strategies for getting feedback for people or just starting out yeah i would say that there's really two strategies um and they actually are in synthesis so the first is people that you know and the second is people that you don't know who follow you so with people that you know these are going to be people in your close circle and i found that a lot of people actually don't have a lot of people who they can share ideas with and if you feel that sort of intellectual loneliness where you're like ah like i get home am so excited about ideas when i'm reading stuff i go on youtube i watch these amazing lectures and then i hang out with my friends on saturday afternoon and they just are like why are you talking about this why are you talking about this we aren't interested in this i felt that for a long time it was pretty brutal and if that's something you feel it's kind of this it's like a lion in a zoo a lion wants to run and the cage won't let it and if that's the case i strongly then recommend that you're publishing stuff online because once you do you become a lighthouse for like-minded people and you end up attracting the very people who end up giving you feedback they then come in synthesis because the people who you attract when you publish stuff online end up becoming your friends who then you can reach out to directly but also remember feedback doesn't need to be deliberate feedback is how many likes you get on a tweet feedback is how many responses or the quality of the responses you get from an email feedback is how people engage with an instagram phone post feedback does not need to be as explicit as hey sarah can you please reserve the next two hours to edit my piece and give me and once you can actually just look at how people are engaging and responding to what you're saying then you can think differently about feedback oh and one more thing feedback also comes through conversation by watching the facial expressions of the people that you're talking to so if you're having a conversation at dinner and they're leaning in they're interested in what you're saying when people laugh they're surprised those are good emotions if someone's slouching and they fall asleep well my friend they're bored and what about what you're saying and so you can actually take feedback in all these ways and you don't need to be so explicit about it the world is always giving you feedback feedback is body language feedback is all over the place you just need to start looking let's uh end on this this was a question very early on jack during your part of the presentation you were talking about being at the marketing firm or the design firm rather and then then you started publishing your work was there a single tipping point or single moment where you decided to make that leap into building in public and if so i would love to hear you share that i was have my own advertising agency to begin with i had no focus whatsoever so just publishing in in the same way that that dribble page i showed was just like a random collection of project work i was doing that originally with a facebook page on um on uh on facebook obviously and uh just publishing uh screenshots of work and couldn't really figure out figure out why this wasn't resonating and one of the ideas that i've been thinking about for a while is you know retroactively i've realized that if you can pioneer a format of some kind so this is getting into the weeds a little bit i it really clicked for me the maybe two days after i started tweeting from the visualize value handle on twitter which was a means to an end like i was running that podcast agency that i mentioned before and this was like client to try and solicit clients and i was like oh who would be a dream client and that's where it clicked so i was like i think naval naseem tuleb seth godin all of these people whose books i'd read that are just like massively informed and shaped my thinking i was like if i imagine i'd already these guys already signed a deal with me right like they're already paying me i'm i work for them i create content for these guys i just started posting it to twitter tagging them and then one um i mean that's the realization i think but then when i doubled down on the behavior was when i think it was in a seam tele retweet um and i this is like the day after i started the visualize value twitter account and the notifications tab was just going like ding ding ding ding ding ding and it was almost like i felt a little bit sick and overwhelmed by i was like this is freaking bizarre because obviously you do get the other side of twitter and especially from a account like that that has very like polarizing views and people following it that believe very specific things there was some like complete pushback like you know this is nonsensical or this is unnet whatever i can't even remember the exact um response to it but that was the moment in time and i think you know everybody will experience that at some point if you work on the internet where you're the outcome so far outweighs the input that you're like okay this only needs to happen to me two or three more times and i'll at least have enough people that i could work for one-on-one right it's just this absolute like complete uh reorganization of opportunity in your mind especially if you have a really specific focus so there's a topic that you write about or there's a style of design that you do that is you know there are there's more demand than you can meet then you're essentially you know economically anti-fragile and there's like we could go into a lot of detail about specificity but i don't think that's helpful if you're beginning your journey either as to where you where you end up all right so you just watched 90 minutes of presentations you want to improve your writing what should you do now two things the first is i have a 50 days of writing email series where you're going to get articles in 50 days for free and all you do is enter your email and i'm going to talk about how to get started with writing how to improve your writing and how to build an audience you'll see the sign up link in the show notes right here on youtube the second thing if you're really serious about improving your writing leveling up your craft i do have rite of passage and the whole course is designed to help you get going then get good and i think that there's two differences between read a passage and a normal writing class the first is that write a passage is social and the second is that it's dynamic nope there's three of them the third is that it's built for the internet age so what i mean by social is this a lot of writing classes you're kind of not allowed to talk you're sort of discouraged from it write a passage is the opposite you're gonna make a ton of friends and by writing from conversation that is what's going to help you remember work up the content triangle and improve your writing the second is that render passages dynamic rather than static a lot of the writing courses i took it was just some teacher at the front lecturing the entire time i didn't want that i wanted to create a course that was vibrant high energy teacher filled with enthusiasm i love this craft people who were psyched fired up to be there and where you were switching switching things up changing things up all the time so that class felt fun and intense but in a good way and then the third is that rite of passage is built for the way the world is not the way the world used to be the internet changed the way that we consume process and share information and rite of passage is a course that's built around the way the world is now and it's not about just writing as an end in itself it's about writing so that you can meet better people who you can riff on ideas with it's about writing so that you can accelerate your career make more money do more meaningful work and it's about writing so that you can think better become a leader in the groups and organizations that you take part in and also make better decisions in your life so hope to see you in rite of passage maybe seeing you reading 50 days of writing but no matter what thanks for joining me today
