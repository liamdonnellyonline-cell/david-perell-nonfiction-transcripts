and then I want to introduce our guest today and lower so I've been following her for a while we were gonna meet in Mexico City and we were so excited and then the pandemic happened and it didn't end up happening but I'm just really impressed with how she's synthesizing all these different kinds of ideas from metacognition to creativity to productivity you just built this beautiful section on your website where you're sharing all your notes your drawings are now beautiful and I'm just like how is she so creative so that's why today we're gonna be talking about building a creativity inbox honestly I'm here to learn just as much as you I'm I'm just in awe of how prolific you are and your ability to build community and make things and I can't wait to learn from you today so thanks for being here and Laura awesome well thank you David and everyone for having me today as you mentioned we're going to talk about building creativity in box and building a creativity system in general from basically finding ideas and inspiration to publishing content online and making it a creative habit so just a little bit about me you can find me on Twitter where I'm pretty active maybe hyper active on Twitter but I am basically the founder of nest labs I used to work at Google where I was based in San Francisco and I left that job about two years ago and now I'm studying part-time at King's College in London and I'm using a lot of the stuff that I'm studying at University to write on my blog and use that which they bit presented and thank you so much for this super nice introduction and what I write about I write about three main topics the first one is mindful productivity so mindful productivity is kind of the opposite of what you would say lots of productivity gurus write about there's lots of productivity porn online that is telling you that if you are struggling to work from 5:00 a.m. to midnight every day while hitting the gym and raising your and doing a PhD it's because you're procrastinating and you should probably work more on yourself um so this is obviously and this is something I'm fighting against and this is kind of my mission to teach people that there's only a certain number of hours that you can actually work in a very creative way that you do need to recharge your batteries and that there are ways to do this they're a much more mindful than trying to cram as much work as possible in a day so that's basically what mindful productivity is about then I write a lot about purposeful creativity and we're going to talk about it today with David it's it's basically about how lots of people see creativity as a hobby on the side so they will have their work and then they will have their promise to you relax and that's completely fine and that's awesome and I do have these kind of hobbies as well but creativity can also be something much more meaningful that you actually embed into your life and that's part of your work and and something that can actually be a bit uncomfortable sometimes something that gets you out of your comfort zone it's not necessarily something that's always relaxing and that's completely fine so purposeful creativity is really about this finding your purpose and your meaning so even when creativity doesn't come as easy as you would want it to be or it's not as relaxing as doing crochet or something like this you would still keep on pushing through and finally the last thing I write about is better thinking um so there's I really believe that if you can understand more about how your mind works you will be able to think better and and I really hope that one day we'll live in the world where everyone will have two thinking tools necessary to both think better and communicate better together so this is why part of why I'm studying your science and what I'm trying to evangelize the content you people so they can use this in their daily life and their daily work so I write a lot about mental models and other such tools do you think better in terms of what I've achieved with Ness lab so far so I started writing on nest labs last summer in July and since then I've written about 200 articles there are about 12,000 newsletter subscribers and I said I did that in less than a year the reason why I'm mentioning the numbers is because when I started I had no idea I would be writing this much or that I would have that many newsletter subscribers less than a year later but the only thing I did Yummie packs are made with myself was to be consistent and basically just like keep on writing keep on improving etc but I didn't set a specific goal a specific number of articles or a number of music or subscribers I basically just told myself to show up every day and she write every day and as you'll see in this short presentation and the conversation we're going to have but David this is basically something I really believe in that it's really not about having those lofty goals that may seem to your heart to reach and you never end up doing any of the work it's really more about thinking of all of the baby steps you can take every day so you get closer to having such a portfolio of articles online so that's why I think the the formula for growing an audience online and writing online is pretty simple doesn't mean it's easy but it's simple it's quality content that you write and publish consistently and you'll notice and it's really important that I'm not saying quantity it's not quality and quantity I did write 200 articles myself it doesn't mean that this is what you should do and it doesn't mean that it will work for for everyone for me the quantity of article I have published is the kind of a byproduct of the fact that I've been writing a lot but it was never a goal to write that many articles what was more important was consistency and just so you can visualize this I could have probably written all of those 200 articles in a couple of months if I had worked really really hard and that was the only thing that I was doing I don't I would have ever reached those 12,000 subscribers in two months if I had just dumped that much content on some people in one go the reason why I am where I am today is because I went from being a complete stranger to these people to being kind of like you know a friend or an expert on these topics that they follow and that they listen to you and this is because we've had many conversations freedom conversations with them reading my articles over the course of a year so it doesn't matter the absolute number of articles that you publish doesn't really matter it's really about being consistent and I think David actually you're a great example of having way fewer articles published than me by you you also wrote about this right that then you start having those kind of cornerstone pieces of content that people keep on coming back to you and I definitely noticed this myself that a company predict which piece of content is going to do well and the Perito role definitely applies to my contents like 20% of my articles like bringing in 80% of the traffic and the new subscribers so I think again not quantity just quality and consistency yeah do you mind if I have been here I think that one of the ways to think about this is what a lot of what you're trying to do when you're right online is is construct a worldview and you're doing that brick by brick and what you're doing when you do that is you're trying to say okay I need to construct a worldview but each individual piece needs to build on top of the other ones and now it shouldn't be like too much of a rational process like actually following your intuition is sort of paradoxically the best way to end up with an emergent property of articles that actually constructs this beautiful painting but what I find is how can I actually add to the Articles that I've built upon and then have these sort of canonical articles that I'm always linking back to and you'll see like with a guy like Ben Thompson this is what he does with aggregation theory it's always what he's coming back to his like the pillar of his work and likewise for me I've written certain articles and have certain ideas like for example audience first products I fundamentally want to as I grow rite-of-passage turn this and let it evolve into a business school where we're having people building audiences and then getting them just our businesses and so I just called that audience first products and now I have that article is sort of this baseline foundation and then I can build on top of it and so I think that what you realize when you write is that all your different ideas are networked and each new article is trying to build the wall build the worldview on top of it and so I would only be publishing our new articles insofar as you're adding to this tapestry of knowledge and actually weaving that quilt together absolutely and actually I think it was pretty recently that we were both mentioned and the same tweets that was about owning a theme or a topic and for you it was writing for me it was mindful productivity and they were quite a few other people listening there but there is definitely something powerful in having your name constantly show up whenever people mentioned a specific topic or look up something like owning that that term and and yeah I agree with you it's not something you can build in one day it's something that you need to leave on and build upon along like during a long time and so let's say now that okay you're convinced that you need to work on this consistently and that you need to produce quality content call how do you find ideas and there used to be this myth of the muse who would come and whisper ideas in the ear of the the artist and there's I think there's been countless poems written by artists who were despairing of not having the muse visiting them that night heard like the muse disappearing also lots of poets who were self-medicating taking opium and stuff like this in order to get the muse to come back and visit them again um so it's it's very interesting that for most of the history of humanity we were living that creativity was something that you experienced or that you didn't experience and that you had very little control over X and and that it was really you know the decision of this news to come and visit you or not so I have good news for all of you who are not into you drugs so there's no news and what's funny though is that even though the idea of this this mythical person visiting me Sound City and most of you don't believe it the idea of creativity that's something that you have or don't have and that you completely control is still something that the vast majority of the population believe it's true and this is why you hear a lot of people saying like oh I have this friend she's so creative or I have this friend he's so creative but very few people believe that creativity is something that can actually be programmed and can actually manufacture it and can actually be controlled which is the case so creativity is and there's quite a bit of research around this is actually combinational in nature there is no such thing as having an idea in your dream that came up salutely out of nowhere every time you have a new idea it's because your brain your mind combines ideas that you read or you heard etc and some sometimes we don't realize that's the case because we combine stuff that we heard yesterday was stuff that we heard two years ago and didn't really remember exactly where that idea came from still doesn't change the fact that there's nothing completely new your new ideas are actually just the combination of other ideas and I like this illustration that was published on the Airbnb blog when they announced their new logo which lots of people were making fun of because it looks like something else but still the process is quite interesting here you know you look at the final you look at the final logo and you would be like oh that's quite new I've never seen anyone use a shape like this for a logo and then you look at their process and when they distract it you see oh actually need this is what they combine together and obviously when it comes to our own individual creativity it's very rare that we can go back and kind of like distract the Lego construction of the idea and see exactly where the idea came from but the process is still the same it's just that we're not as intentional and we're not as good as documenting the process so it's hard to need to go back so when you understand that creativity is something that's combinational that it's like playing Lego you know that's just the its natural to go onto the next step and stats if you have quality input you will have quality output and this is something that you know the reverse is true if you don't have good input you'll have bad creative output and and I think it's pretty everything but this is still something that we're not very intentional without obviously if you spend a whole week just binging kind of like TV shows on the Netflix which is a nice thing to do time to time I'm not judging anyone I've done this but you can't really expect to be very productive and created that day and you come up with lots of interesting ideas on the other end if you you still watch a little bit of Netflix but you mix it with reading some interesting articles and then you read a book when you listen to a nice podcast that's lots of different quality input that you bring in together to potentially get some good outputs and I always meant like the metaphor that I use is like your your diet your nutrition it's the same basically it's if you if you only eat the same thing however good it is you're not going to have a balanced diet you're not going to be healthy you know even if cucumber is healthy if you only just eat that can just starve to death so it's it's really about making sure that you have a varied diet and with higher the highest quality ingredients as possible that you're consuming and it's the same with content yeah one of the things I want to add on to this is there's a documentary it's a really good documentary on Netflix it's called jiro Dreams of Sushi and it's about the world a sushi restaurant and how they make such delicious food and one of those surprising things about the documentary is how much of it doesn't happen in the kitchen but rather happens at the morning fish market and that's because the people who run this restaurants are obsessed with finding the best sushi fish before it even gets to the kitchen and so what they do is they go they see all of their friends they have all of these connections and it there's actually a line at the market because it's so competitive every day to go get the best fish and the lesson here is that you can't actually make great sushi with your output unless the input of delicious fish happens and it's the same thing with ideas that just as a chef if they want to improve the quality of their cooking a writer if you want to improve the quality of your writing the first thing that you should be doing is focusing on making sure that every single thing that comes into your brain is of high quality so you're always at the Tokyo fish market and that way we can make some really high-quality sushi I love this and you know here is an example of taking quality input I'm absolutely going to still the Douro story for the next time I'm giving this presentation I love the documentary - never thought about the parallel so yeah thank you for that so yeah I didi can imagine zero and going to the market bringing putting it bringing it to the kitchen but ideally this is basically what your creative process should look like obviously we're going to talk about what that combinational magic is like later on doesn't have to stay a black box but ideally this is what it should look like lots of quality ingredients coming in then combinational magic and then quality output crazy creative output unfortunately what happens for most people is more something like this we get some content in there very often random content and we don't take any notes we don't do anything to remember and our brain is more like a leaky bucket where we just forget things as soon as we consume them so instead of allowing our ideas to stay in the bucket for long enough for the combinational magic to happen we just forget those ideas way too quickly so this is why I like all of this that I just explained is to convince you that instead of like waiting for inspiration you should basically try to make sure that your ideas have sex together and so they need to stay in the same room for long enough together for it to happen so inspiration is the version we talked about before the news coming to you at night and whispering ideas in your ear that doesn't work some people say drugs help but this is not a sustainable way to go about it if you want to write every day so we need a better process for this idea sex is a much better way to go about it why so let's just compare them inspiration is passive it's something you wait to happen to you it's impregnable because you are just waiting for the muse to come and maybe it doesn't and then you're just destroy basically and it's stressful because you may have a deadline or you may have an event for which you don't have something ready to publish or you may have the collaboration with someone something cool happening and you're just basically staring at a blank page with nothing happening the cliche of the writer staring at a blank page and I think it's a cliche because it has happened to so many people that it is real I'm not saying it's not real I'm saying that it doesn't have to happen this way idea sex on the other hand is active you're provoking it you're making it happen it's programmable you can create models and systems for yourself so you don't need to wait for your creativity to just come and visit you and it's mindful instead of stressful because it takes into account your natural your levels of mental energy and the time that you have to write and the the resources that you have the help that you may get from other people it it's really about building a creative process that works for you instead of just waiting for creativity to visit you maybe or maybe not and to me something that's core to turning inspiration into you idea sex is action driven note-taking and you'll see a little bit more about what I mean by this so I see a lot of people take notes and they think that it it fixes the leaky bucket problem it doesn't just taking notes by themselves doesn't fix this problem what it does is just that you add more stuff in the bucket but it doesn't necessarily close the hole that makes all of your ideas and even you forget them so something typical for example of people who take notes is you know just writing verbatim lots of other stuff that they're reading or hearing writing as much as possible i I do suspect that there's a little bit of anxiety here and that's by writing the love of notes we feel like we're doing something productive she's not necessarily the case and then they add lots of times lots and lots of tags because they think that it's going to help them retrieve the information later so they're going to be like you know hashtag reading hashtag car is hashtag driving hashtag wheels hashtag travel hashtag journey hashtag heb and they're just going to add all of these because they're like you know maybe my mine later they know that their their mind is quite fragile and that they're going to forget so they're like let's use all of these tags that's going to help me surprise it doesn't because no one searches like this you don't that's not how you remember ideas we don't use tags in your mind so it doesn't really work like this for note-taking either so instead what I personally use those are the only tags that I'm using I'm using to read to process and to write and that so there's only three tags I'm using in my note-taking system it doesn't mean I don't have more links and I'm going to share a bit more about this later - in terms of tagging you will never see a tag that is like a random generic words next to notes that I have so the first phase for me is to read so to read this is basically my reading inbox and I'll talk a lot more later but I am very anti multitasking I think it's very bad to you you basically lose your concentration every time you switch between tasks so every time I stumble upon something interesting so for example I'm on trigger I see that David posted something interesting as he often does I'm not going to stop what I'm doing I'm just going to take this link and paste it in my note-taking system and tag it to read and that goes in my inbox and whenever I'll have time like okay oh yeah there was this article here and I can I can read it so this is a living inbox it's very similar to an email inbox but it's for its for reading and the best thing is that there's no spam in it because I'm the only one having content there which is great another thing that's very important about my to read inbox is that there is really no guiltiness like I have content in there that has been there for a month and it's fine I will probably not read it ever and because it's by date and there's no counter of number of articles in there I don't have the anxiety that you have with your inbox of having 200 unread emails here I don't know how many are there and to me if there's something that's been there for two months and I still haven't read it it means that a problem once and it's completely fine so it's a more mindful way to consume content rather than being at the mercy of your email inbox or reading stuff as soon as you see it when you're on Twitter and where it becomes very anxiety inducing so then I take notes well I read something I accorded a video on my youtube if you want to check it out later where I'm doing that in real time I'm reading this article and and I'm taking notes and I I try and copy and paste as little as possible from the the article I mostly write questions things that I want to explore later so this is why I mean it's action driven note-taking is that I'm not taking notes just to remember stuff because I'm not going to remember it much better just because I took notes I make sure that whatever I put in there is action driven it's something that it's I'm going to use to write an article later so this is why I mean my notes are very short and I'm very selective and I always think when I'm taking notes how could that be helpful for an article I may write later and to your point a bit about building on top of things like when you think like this this makes much more sense right yeah wow that's really interesting i love this so walk me through what you're thinking when you're reading both in terms of how you're reading thinking about potential future articles and how that impacts the ideas that you actually save and then walk me through your questions and just to give you and I just to give you some time to think about it I'll just give you one example so I have a couple little things that I do so my read it later app that I use so it looks like you use room research I use an app called instapaper and often when I'm reading on Kindle I'll do the same thing so I have a couple things like even last night I was reading something and I forget what it was it was a history of time going back to like the 13th in the 14th century it was very interesting and I saw and like what I'll do is I'll write things like love this and then I have a little three sort of like a strict symbol whenever I see a three asterisk symbol it's like a story that I want to use in a future article often what I'll do as well is I will write a long paragraph as I read that just sort of sit includes the ideas that are flowing through my mind and my general point especially with that last idea is people underestimate the extent to which reading is a sandbox for you to have interesting ideas in that reading isn't necessarily about what you take out of the ideas that are coming into your brain oh my goodness I need to memorize this all these sorts of things this sort of stress and anxiety that we feel when we read if you have this system that on lawyers talking about of oh I'm gonna write down my questions oh I'm gonna actually have my comments and think about how I can make life easier for myself when I write you begin to realize that you're creating this environment for yourself to have interesting ideas with just like when you go to a club the music is creating an environment for certain emotions to occur and for certain interactions to happen looks like on Laura's frozen so I'll keep going so with that one of the things that I would think about as you read is to consider what can I do to actually make my writing process easier and it's interesting what happens when you begin to read like a writer you see that the the distinction between creation and consumption begins to disappear and what ends up happening is as you are consuming something you begin to think what will I need to know as a creator to make my life easier because when you create I always say that in school we're taught to research first and right second but on Laura she's written what 200 articles and in order to do that you can't get to a place where okay it's time for a new article now I need to go spend 4050 hours researching like school teach us a whole semester you need to get your note-taking system to a place where by the time that you sit down to write you already have 80 90 percent of the information that you're going to need and that's when you should start a project hey will I have a question are there any questions in the Q&A that I can take right now yeah definitely let's jump to a couple of those let's see I mean I think this is a good one apart from writing consistently in developing your own voice over time are there any strategies you recommend to start developing your own style more quickly yeah the style question is interesting um I would focus on fun that if you have fun as a writer you will have style whereas if you focus on having style you won't necessarily have fun and this is something I think a lot about in running a school for nine to eleven year olds what we do is we focus on making sure that the kids have fun throughout the week because we know that if kids have fun it will then lead into creativity and a lot of what style is as a process well you could think of it in a couple ways the first this style is your own sort of weird idiosyncratic quirks and those are things that just gonna that are just gonna emerge naturally like when you watch me I'm sure I have interesting ways of speaking and sort of thinking and sort of going through ideas of some kind I have no idea what they are and that style is actually an emergent property of me just doing what sort of natural to me but then what I find is that if you try to have fun as a writer what ends up happening is style begins to emerge because when you have fun you're tapping into this deep intuition and the wisdom of our intuition especially in creative moments is so beyond what the rational mind could ever fathom and so when you are trying to be creative with your rational mind you actually prevent style and in individuality but if you think of style itself as just a productive individuality your intuition will give you that and so if you can write from the heart actually spew out your soul on to the page style will just be a natural and inevitable byproduct so I would encourage you to have fun to trust your intuition and to style is one of those things that you actually get by not focusing on it too much but then by thinking how can I let my own idiosyncratic quirks actually come on to the page rather than deflecting them so I can fit in or conform I'm actually back my laptop like my MacBook restarted after an update in the middle of this that's a first for me I'm sorry it's all good we had some great questions so we just kept going if you just want to go back to the presentation yeah I'm just going to answer your question I had lots of things you think about since I was gone yes so in terms of topics first I agree with you the fact that I've been writing about a set of maybe three five main topics and radar topics on my blog helps a lot to frame the way I'm reading contents so it's kind of easy to directly see does that fit in general with with what I write about or is it completely out there and it's finally I also read stuff just for pleasure but if I read for pleasure I'm not going to be taking notes if I'm reading a good novel or just something that is completely outside of the field of what I'm writing about this is completely fine I'm not going to have Rome open and n-type notes as I go because that would feel like work which is you know creative like creative work and just like relaxing as I said not the same thing so that's the first way I go about it the second is that the more you write the more there's stuff you want to write about so I do actually have also in my note-taking system articles that I want to write but I feel like I still haven't formed a good opinion about them or I don't have enough information or enough data and they're there and I can link what I take notes about back to these articles that I may want to write in the future and right now it may feel like it's just like having these ideas that pop out but it's really part of the writing process at first when I wrote my very first articles on my blog I was being very hungry for ideas so I would interrupt friends when we were having conversations and just be like oh wait wait give me once again I need to write this down and I was just writing everything down all the time now I've kind of the opposite problem where my list of ideas of stuff I want to write about is way too long and I need to start being selective so I think once you start having a few ideas of what you want to write about the question you ask yourself when you take notes is basically can I connect this new note whatever I'm about to write back to something that exists already or would that be something that would live in complete isolation and chances are if you put something in your system that lives in complete isolation you will never stumble upon it ever again you will never think about it ever again because it's not connected to the rest of your thinking web of sorts so those are the main mental models that I use when I'm and taking notes and for the questions it's really anything that either the simplest ones are the ones where I just don't understand so here for example this literary question is like what is the Riemann hypothesis say I don't know what this is and the author wrote it like if anyone who would read the article would know and it would be basic stuff and I'm not a physicist so I met the nitrogen sorry so I didn't know what it was and then some other questions or more stuff that I wonder about or they're based on statements and an author make like if it was obvious and I'm like what is it really isn't there something a little bit more interesting going on isn't it something that I could write about so those are the two main kind of questions that I write in my notes so once I'm done processing what's really nice is that if I go back just to the previous one at the bottom you can see that it says like tools for a systemic interconnectedness that's an article I've been thinking about writing about and so here's an example of what I was telling you every time I've been taking notes and I thought that it was relevant to this article which is in my writing inbox it shows up here so it means that whenever I'm ready to sit down I have links to all of the different places where I mentioned this before in my other notes so it makes it very very easy to combine ideas again this is this recombination creativity here but in the system rather than just waiting for it to happen I can combine all of the interesting information and thoughts in questions that I've had before and use them to write a new article and something that hopefully hasn't been written exactly in the way I'm going to write it and so this is really why like it's a different way of thinking a different way of writing instead of being linear which is how we're being tough to write in school in school you're being taught what is your question great now write an outline now fill this outline with the content do your research at the same time and then we need to have a conclusion which kind of assumes that you already know exactly what you're going to write about that you have all of the answers that you've studied from the test because this is what school is about study for the test and then write exactly where your teacher is expecting you to write because this is how you're going to have a good great because there's a metric saying what's good and what's not this is different instead of going ABCD linear thinking you use network thinking instead and again idea sex this is all of these ideas connecting together and making idea babies and helping me write essays one of the things I want to add to this is that there's an element here of writing for discovery versus writing for an answer that most of what I'm writing isn't things that I know it is things that I have an intuition that something is interesting and it's sort of like when you're a kid and you start exploring and if adult was like where are you going you're like I don't know I just thought that that was cool and it's the same sort of thing that it's like this feeling that you have this fingertips feeling we are sort of navigating through the idea maze to say ha there's something over there that I think is really interesting but I don't know what it is and right now for me what I'm really interested in is the history of work and sort of relationships between labor and capital and how they happened in the industrial era and then now how those are beginning to shift into the Internet era and what that means for the individual I have no idea where I'm going to end up there I know that that's something I'm really interested in terms of building businesses in terms of helping people write online but this is an essay that I'm working on and I've called it why work went wrong I've set a planted a flag that I said I'm gonna write 10,000 words about this I have a big whiteboard right over here that has okay have an outline here that I'm sort of trying to build off ideas but I have no idea where I'm gonna go and so I'm really interested in this subject and so what I'm doing rather than school saying look at how much I know look at me look at me now give me a good grade what I'm saying is I'm really interested in this and if I learn for public consumption my ideas will be sharper and more refined and then by teaching others other people who've already studied this who have already thought about this who see things in different ways almost like a kaleidoscope will then come back to me and say David you miss this I really liked your point on that and then it will set off this intellectual cascade of ideas where then that can be some new multi-year rabbit hole that I go down and then I just benefit because the ideas happen to be on my site absolutely I actually talk about this a little bit later on so I love that you're mentioning this the whole like multiplayer thinking aspects of it which is amazing so okay that sounds like a lot of work basically everything I just described and I realize this so I think it's very important you asked yourself how much creative work is enough creative work do you really want to spend your whole day doing this don't you have other things to do don't you have like basically outside of writing and I think most people do and you're not supposed to spend all of your time on this so it looks like a lot of work but it doesn't have to be and it's really about having the right processes in place and about being mindful of your time and your energy levels I just want to very briefly mention the study that I think is really interesting it was conducted in the 50s and there was conducted at a university where they interviewed 200 scientists and researchers so basically knowledge workers what we call knowledge workers today I don't think that was a word there was that popular at the time but this is really what it is and what they did very simple is that they compared the number of hours these people were working with the number of papers they were publishing because it's really hard to measure what productivity is like being productive but here in this scientific paper they have a very rational way of going about it how many papers you publish how many hours did you work when you see the curve is quite interesting it has this M shape basically up to a certain point up to 20 hours a week the productivity is going up and then it goes down that's interesting for me I'm French we have the 35 hour work week in France and this is the lowest point on the curve so I think my government hobby needs to change something up but then it goes up again up to 50 and then down again for the 50 bit I was really curious I was like this is work so I read the rest of the paper to understand and actually this is a bit you know misleading because the reason why all of the scientists that are in the second part of the M up here our scientists that had lots of lab work so they didn't need to be in the lab for much longer they needed to be more hours there sometimes just waiting in line to have time with the scanner access to the lab et cetera so it inflated the numbers for them so really if you look at this curve the highest levels of productivity here are about 20 hours for a work week and this is actually where you probably heard about the four hours of creative work per day you know rule that people should have that's where it comes from basically if you work Monday through Friday should only work four hours per day basically and by hours of creative work I don't mean how hours of work because most people in their job they do have admin they have emails they have to reply to people if you run a community you need to talk to members there's lots of stuff going on basically but actual focused creative work such as writing coming up with ideas being in the flow we you know we peek in terms of productivity and creativity if we only use four hours a day of this so again another proof that it's really not about quantity there's no point in cramming your day and like forcing yourself to stare at a page if you're you're you contrite or just like trying to write as much as possible non-stop for a day from 5:00 a.m. to whatever number of hours productivity gurus tell you to work for a day it's really about consistency and you will have way better results if instead of forcing yourself for a week to work really really hard to the point of being tired if instead you show up for a few hours every day but you do this for a year this is where you're going to really start seeing the results and which is consistent again with what you see with these scientists you don't do a full research paper in one week of hardcore work you do it over a few months a little bit of work every day and that's what worked for them and this is what should work for most knowledge workers so how do you do this to me the best technique is time blocking it doesn't work for everyone but I think it's because lots of people are doing it in a way that is quite extreme so again if you go and productivity blocks this is what time locking looks like that's your calendar it's like all completely books the nonstop I see this it gives me anxiety seriously so this is what my calendar looks like has lots of gaps in there and the reason why it looks like this is because I only block time for things that matter and I don't care about filling my whole calendar up like actually if my calendar looks pretty empty for a week I'm really happy about it I don't feel unproductive because of it what you will see here is that I have some recurring tasks and the main one is writing I write first thing in the meringue for an hour and a half that's in my calendar that's recurring doesn't have an end date and I've been doing this since last summer when I started writing for Knesset's and this consistency has been a big part of why I think the blog has been successful and then I blocked time for other important things for me like going to the gym and this kind of thing so it's not only about work it's really about what are the things that I know we'll feel bad about not doing at the end of the week if I don't do them and those are the only things I block time for so in order to for this to work there are a few principles that you need to apply so I first I mentioned that already only block time for what matters be ruthless you're not going to be more productive because you fill your calendar with lots of random stuff so be ruthless with this the second thing is protect your time by saying no so once you've managed to implement time block it for yourself your time is really precious so protect it say no ideally I know that's how people say later don't say later if you're not going to do it that's disrespectful just say no and move on like don't put that in your in your calendar avoid multitasking so one block in your in your calendar should be for one task so I have blocks for reading I have blocks for writing but I don't like you know except if I am I'm really working on an article on a specific topic I'm not going to browse Twitter and go read stuff and and random stuff that's not related to what I'm doing right now I'm very focused on one task at a time take breaks breaks are really good don't feel like you're being unproductive because you're taking breaks and create mindful routines for yourself so as I mentioned earlier I have stuff in there that may not feel productive to people but sometimes I feel like I need a break so I'm going to you know I book time I put routine - you go for a walk or to go to the gym for some people it's just to listen to their favorite podcast or whatever but don't feel like every single time you spend during the day it has to be spent writing because again input output so think about the input yeah one of the things I want to focus on here is there's a question the chat about how you write first thing in the morning and it's basically implying like wait but don't you need to read before you actually write and I think that there's a deep misconception here about the feedback loops of reading um if you're reading things that are Hardy and that have soul and that have information content that are making you think the feedback loops actually taking years like something that you read four or five years ago will only begin to crystallize for you now and it really isn't about this like huff and puff get it absolutely exhausted flow of oh my goodness oh my goodness I'm gonna read all the time I'm again this I'm gonna read all the time then I'm gonna write about what I just read it's gonna be crazy I'm gonna go like this oh my goodness I need to publish all the time that's not the point at all the point here is to read things that every single thing that comes into your mind is of ultra high quality then to get away from this idea of speed reading which doesn't work and to think of reading as something that isn't okay I need to consume and memorize and then regurgitate this information but rather as something like I'm gonna take some small bits of information that are gonna make me smarter but that are more importantly going to allow ideas to churn in my mind you know it's kind of like good music pop music which is the way that this question implies is like pop reading where you're trying to get music or articles and books that just like give you intellectual candy and it's just sort of like fun and entertaining and you're dancing but if you listen to classical music what you realize are just any kind of good music something that isn't of the popular genre what you realize is you can get quality and if you listen to it more and more and more you actually begin to hear things that you never thought you heard before so maybe a song like even a good more popular song will catch you with the beat then it'll catch you with the lyrics then as you continue to listen you'll say oh my goodness that relates to a song from three albums to go and wow that actually relates to something I'm going through but that process will take years and so what I'm encouraging you to do is to think of reading as something that this like multi-year project and not this process of exhaustion if I need to do more I need to work harder it is much more about applying leverage on your time with how you're reading so that when you do sit down to write you already have those sushi high quality fish ingredients for you to work with I love this I can tell you're a writer you're good with metaphors but yeah I told you agree and as I mentioned earlier again remember for two ideas to have sex they have to be able to stay in the same room for long enough so it's not about being really quick here I also yeah totally agree okay so if you do manage to write quality content in a consistent manner what do you get them because we've been all about the how but why would you want you to do this so first what you get is which is amazing like we mentioned it already it's a solo player Network thinking being able to navigate your own idea maze having new ideas coming in together being able to think long term about topics in a way that means that you're going to form your own ideas around them which is not something that common when you think about it many people go through life without ever creating an idea of their own without ever building on top of older ideas to add to it lots of people never do that in their life so just for this I think it's worth creating creating and building a creative system for yourself just to be able to say that you know I was here and I had my own ideas and this is pretty cool already but then you can take it a step further and go from solo network thinking to multiplayer network thinking and this is where it starts getting really interesting and David touched on this a little bit earlier in in the chat about how writing and publishing what you write and and working in public and creating in public like this creates those amazing conversations and you start you know people learn from you but you start learning from them also and you start having conversations I often say that reading a book by an author is like having a conversation with them and that it's amazing that we're able to have so many conversations with us from a hundred years ago to like a thousand years ago and we can read their thoughts and have this conversation with them if we decide to engage and be active in the reading process and it's the same with the Internet today you can have the passive interaction with it where it's more about schooling and just like you know watching videos and going onto the next one or you can be an active player and have a real conversation with people and then it starts feeding into your creative system because you reach something interesting on Twitter you save it into your reading inbox to read it later you start building on it and then you know maybe if the author is on Twitter you can actually the author that inspired you to write about this in the first place you can tag them and say hey I loved your article I expanded it upon your ideas a little bit what do you think and you can have a real conversation with them the same then when you start publishing your articles on your blog or publishing them in your newsletter you start building an audience of people who are waiting for you to share your work and who will also share feedback with you and so basically being able to have this conversation is a very privileged thing that you can constantly talk about stuff that you care about what people who are also interested in the same things this is pretty amazing and I think it makes it worth it to you put in this this work should you put your work out there so you can connect with like-minded people so in my case a quick overview of stuff that has happened because of my writing but I have played my Twitter I have about 25,000 followers now and I have amazing conversations there I have met lots of people that I don't think I could have just reached out to with the cold email but because it's Twitter and because I care a lot about those topics and write about them makes it much easier to make new friends basically I have the nest labs community of people who are all interested in mindful productivity and purposeful crazy easier and better thinking and I have a telegram group for newsletter owners where we talk about writing etc and basically when one you start writing regularly and publishing regularly you are going to have an audience forming around you and you can just wait for it to happen or you can be a little bit more proactive but in any case it is going to happen because this is how curious minds communicate together by reading stuff from other people listening to the podcast excetera so the best way to start being part of these communities is to start contributing yourself so this is for me another advantage and one of the other reasons why you may want to do this and to write more online and I have a public notebook also where I push like they would mentioned it a little bit earlier but another thing that I think is quite important for me is that I don't necessarily wait until I have an amazing like 5000 words essay to publish I sometimes published nuggets and little thoughts and this is the same with the you know this multiplayer network thinking that's happening here I have people commenting on this giving me feedback sending additional links that I can activate reading inbox and I learn from them and they learn from me and this is just a big part of the creative process of making it iterative and publishing my notes before I have a blog post that is available and then that's the last set that's basically publishing on the blog so as you see like I have ideas that come from Twitter from telegram from the Nestle apps community then I have made public notes where it's like a little bit more refined but it's not necessarily something that I would publish on my blog in my newsletter and once I have the proper essay something that I'm pretty proud of then it goes on the blog and on the music but the reason why I call it multiplayer is that I don't necessarily wait until I have something perfect to post it I do post my thinking in steps I post my first ideas on Twitter and then notes on my public notebook and then the essay so this is also something that I really encourage people to do is don't wait until like don't work for six months on something with nobody seeing it especially if you're just beginning writing if it's something very new for you people who can afford to not show their work at all for six months for publishing in general they've been writers for quite a long time and they know what they're doing so at the beginning I think make this feedback loop a little bit shorter and you show it to people share it with fellow writers you know David has this amazing community right of passage like show it to people there get their feedback etc but don't wait until you have something you think is perfect you publish it and show it to people yeah I think that this is something that we talk a lot about and write a passage so we're talking about network thinking here but there's actually three different buckets of networked thinking that I just want to sort of split everything apart and make very visible so there's Network thinking both in terms of our own minds where we're networked between all the ideas that we have and actually building this intellectual quilt weaving it one post at a time that's number one the second kind of networked thinking is us with all of the authors outside of us you know Rene Descartes said that the reading of all good books is like a conversation with the finest minds of past centuries so what we're doing here is we're going back and we are finding who else is talking about things that can contribute to our ideas so we're networked now within our own minds and then we're network through time but we're also networked through space and so what on Laura is saying here is if you go out and share your ideas you're gonna become a lighthouse for like-minded people and you are going to magnetically attract all of these people and to add to the third leg of the tripod that has networked thinking she is then encouraging all these people to come to actually help her improve and iterate refine and develop her ideas and it is through those three different kinds of networked thinking that we begin to take advantage of the Internet absolutely so yeah so this is basically exactly where you just explained this amazing recap [Laughter] and and the one thing I would add is that you know you can see how there's a progression between those three different steps but it doesn't have to stop here it can then go beyond like it didn't have stopped it can be a lifelong process of exploring what are other levels of you know sharing your thinking with other people and you know I've seen quite a few people who started with Twitter and then they had a blog and not they're writing your books basically so Chango is one of them for example and I've seen a few other people doing this and for some people maybe it would be creating a course or maybe becoming a public speaker but there's so many other options that are obviously not the ones you're going to start with if you haven't published anything yet but that can be options in the future and really for me multiplayer networked thinking is about creating more options for yourself and you don't know yet today when you're getting started what they're going to be I didn't know when I started writing all of the doors that this would open and this is fine I think instead of trying to guess what's going to happen just apply consistency make sure to publish quality content keep on doing it and then you're going to be surprised by the opportunities that are going to open you and so one last thing that favorite expression ever and I always repeat it to people remember that this is basically a learning process so fail like a scientist scientist they don't design experiments knowing exactly what's going to happen they don't design experiments to achieve a specific goal they design experiments to answer a question and this is really what it is about here ask yourself you know would I be able to write an essay about this like would I be able to do this like do I have something interesting to say here can i maybe combine those two ideas together and see if there's a third angle that I could bring to the table here and then that's basically your hypothesis can I do this or not let's try it you experiment you see you know how you do it etc and then you observe the results what could have been better what's the feedback from people what could I improve was it hard was easy are they any ways that I could make it maybe make it easier for myself or more interesting next time and then you firm a new hypothesis and you rinse and repeat and for me the creative process is more like that rather than having this linear perfect recipe that you're going to follow and that's going to tell you step by step what to you you will need you know you can have as much guidance as possible and it is amazing to have people who have been there done that and can tell you what worked for 01:0:2,079 --> 01:0:4,069 01:0:2,089 --> 01:0:6,109 them but in the end you will still need 01:0:4,059 --> 01:0:6,109 01:0:4,069 --> 01:0:7,730 to put in the work and you will probably 01:0:6,099 --> 01:0:7,730 01:0:6,109 --> 01:0:10,069 need to try and you will probably need 01:0:7,720 --> 01:0:10,069 01:0:7,730 --> 01:0:12,109 to fail and you will need to try again 01:0:10,059 --> 01:0:12,109 01:0:10,069 --> 01:0:15,920 and to me this is really the difference 01:0:12,099 --> 01:0:15,920 01:0:12,109 --> 01:0:18,980 between writers and just people who 01:0:15,910 --> 01:0:18,980 01:0:15,920 --> 01:0:20,779 wrote some stuff writers or people who 01:0:18,970 --> 01:0:20,779 01:0:18,980 --> 01:0:23,869 probably wrote a lot of really bad stuff 01:0:20,769 --> 01:0:23,869 01:0:20,779 --> 01:0:26,150 and they kept on going and today they 01:0:23,859 --> 01:0:26,150 01:0:23,869 --> 01:0:27,619 write better but they failed and they 01:0:26,140 --> 01:0:27,619 01:0:26,150 --> 01:0:29,839 kept on going and they kept on writing 01:0:27,609 --> 01:0:29,839 01:0:27,619 --> 01:0:32,720 in they kept on publishing and you ask 01:0:29,829 --> 01:0:32,720 01:0:29,839 --> 01:0:34,369 any author about stuff that they wrote a 01:0:32,710 --> 01:0:34,369 01:0:32,720 --> 01:0:35,809 few years ago they will all tell you 01:0:34,359 --> 01:0:35,809 01:0:34,369 --> 01:0:38,059 that they're quite ashamed of what they 01:0:35,799 --> 01:0:38,059 01:0:35,809 --> 01:0:39,200 wrote and that it's a good thing so I 01:0:38,049 --> 01:0:39,200 01:0:38,059 --> 01:0:41,269 think this is really something to 01:0:39,190 --> 01:0:41,269 01:0:39,200 --> 01:0:43,759 remember here I think that there's a 01:0:41,259 --> 01:0:43,759 01:0:41,269 --> 01:0:47,720 general principle that has emerged from 01:0:43,749 --> 01:0:47,720 01:0:43,759 --> 01:0:50,150 this conversation in how interestingness 01:0:47,710 --> 01:0:50,150 01:0:47,720 --> 01:0:52,880 is a compass for where you should take 01:0:50,140 --> 01:0:52,880 01:0:50,150 --> 01:0:54,890 your writing you know a lot of the 01:0:52,870 --> 01:0:54,890 01:0:52,880 --> 01:0:56,089 questions as I look at the Q&A here 01:0:54,880 --> 01:0:56,089 01:0:54,890 --> 01:0:58,099 they're like what should I do 01:0:56,079 --> 01:0:58,099 01:0:56,089 --> 01:1:0,049 how should I think about this should I 01:0:58,089 --> 01:1:0,049 01:0:58,099 --> 01:1:3,799 read this much should I write this much 01:1:0,039 --> 01:1:3,799 01:1:0,049 --> 01:1:5,750 and look the fact of the matter is the 01:1:3,789 --> 01:1:5,750 01:1:3,799 --> 01:1:7,849 best way to be interesting to other 01:1:5,740 --> 01:1:7,849 01:1:5,750 --> 01:1:10,549 people is to be interesting to yourself 01:1:7,839 --> 01:1:10,549 01:1:7,849 --> 01:1:12,500 and if you are continually surprising 01:1:10,539 --> 01:1:12,500 01:1:10,549 --> 01:1:15,019 yourself if you are continually going 01:1:12,490 --> 01:1:15,019 01:1:12,500 --> 01:1:17,720 down these rabbit holes of oh that's 01:1:15,009 --> 01:1:17,720 01:1:15,019 --> 01:1:20,900 really interesting and then always 01:1:17,710 --> 01:1:20,900 01:1:17,720 --> 01:1:23,809 raising your standards for what an 01:1:20,890 --> 01:1:23,809 01:1:20,900 --> 01:1:26,170 interesting idea is you'll realize that 01:1:23,799 --> 01:1:26,170 01:1:23,809 --> 01:1:29,480 just the byproduct of what you produce 01:1:26,160 --> 01:1:29,480 01:1:26,170 --> 01:1:31,849 will be better than what you could have 01:1:29,470 --> 01:1:31,849 01:1:29,480 --> 01:1:34,809 done if you had set this rational plan 01:1:31,839 --> 01:1:34,809 01:1:31,849 --> 01:1:37,809 so what you can see is that 01:1:34,799 --> 01:1:37,809 01:1:34,809 --> 01:1:41,400 revolutionary ideas come from 01:1:37,799 --> 01:1:41,400 01:1:37,809 --> 01:1:44,710 evolutionary thinking 01:1:41,390 --> 01:1:44,710 01:1:41,400 --> 01:1:46,599 absolutely yeah I'm basically done I'm 01:1:44,700 --> 01:1:46,599 01:1:44,710 --> 01:1:48,279 not necessarily going to no good heard 01:1:46,589 --> 01:1:48,279 01:1:46,599 --> 01:1:50,019 of this this is just a recap and we can 01:1:48,269 --> 01:1:50,019 01:1:48,279 --> 01:1:52,960 keep it in the in the background but 01:1:50,009 --> 01:1:52,960 01:1:50,019 --> 01:1:55,960 those are the key ideas that I talked 01:1:52,950 --> 01:1:55,960 01:1:52,960 --> 01:1:58,900 about here forget inspiration try idea 01:1:55,950 --> 01:1:58,900 01:1:55,960 --> 01:2:1,299 sex instead forget linear thinking use 01:1:58,890 --> 01:2:1,299 01:1:58,900 --> 01:2:3,729 network thinking instead go from solo 01:2:1,289 --> 01:2:3,729 01:2:1,299 --> 01:2:6,299 player to multiplayer don't focus on 01:2:3,719 --> 01:2:6,299 01:2:3,729 --> 01:2:9,670 quantity think about consistency and 01:2:6,289 --> 01:2:9,670 01:2:6,299 --> 01:2:11,349 don't try and give yourself crazy goals 01:2:9,660 --> 01:2:11,349 01:2:9,670 --> 01:2:15,970 just focus on the process and keep on 01:2:11,339 --> 01:2:15,970 01:2:11,349 --> 01:2:18,279 showing up that's it there we go thank 01:2:15,960 --> 01:2:18,279 01:2:15,970 --> 01:2:23,799 you that was fantastic I have a question 01:2:18,269 --> 01:2:23,799 01:2:18,279 --> 01:2:25,509 for you around feedback how are you how 01:2:23,789 --> 01:2:25,509 01:2:23,799 --> 01:2:28,059 do you take feedback how do you actively 01:2:25,499 --> 01:2:28,059 01:2:25,509 --> 01:2:29,680 solicit it and what are some of the 01:2:28,049 --> 01:2:29,680 01:2:28,059 --> 01:2:31,720 structures that you've built into your 01:2:29,670 --> 01:2:31,720 01:2:29,680 --> 01:2:34,239 life to actually develop ideas is 01:2:31,710 --> 01:2:34,239 01:2:31,720 --> 01:2:36,579 writing a very solo process for you or 01:2:34,229 --> 01:2:36,579 01:2:34,239 --> 01:2:38,739 are you pretty social actually having 01:2:36,569 --> 01:2:38,739 01:2:36,579 --> 01:2:41,710 conversations getting feedback before 01:2:38,729 --> 01:2:41,710 01:2:38,739 --> 01:2:45,339 you actually start writing yeah so in 01:2:41,700 --> 01:2:45,339 01:2:41,710

01:3:35,319 --> 01:3:40,779 basically so just by being on Twitter 01:3:37,950 --> 01:3:40,779 01:3:37,960 --> 01:3:42,549 posting what I think posting on my 01:3:40,769 --> 01:3:42,549 01:3:40,779 --> 01:3:45,279 public notebook I get lots of feedback 01:3:42,539 --> 01:3:45,279 01:3:42,549 --> 01:3:48,309 and then time to time when I'm a little 01:3:45,269 --> 01:3:48,309 01:3:45,279 --> 01:3:49,930 bit stuck I will send my draft to a 01:3:48,299 --> 01:3:49,930 01:3:48,309 --> 01:3:53,319 couple of friends but I'm being very 01:3:49,920 --> 01:3:53,319 01:3:49,930 --> 01:3:54,540 selective I send it to a couple of 01:3:53,309 --> 01:3:54,540 01:3:53,319 --> 01:3:56,550 friends that I know 01:3:54,530 --> 01:3:56,550 01:3:54,540 --> 01:3:59,040 know that what I'm wondering about or 01:3:56,540 --> 01:3:59,040 01:3:56,550 --> 01:4:1,410 that I admire for the way they think and 01:3:59,030 --> 01:4:1,410 01:3:59,040 --> 01:4:3,690 who have helped me in the past get 01:4:1,400 --> 01:4:3,690 01:4:1,410 --> 01:4:6,810 unstuck basically so I will do that 01:4:3,680 --> 01:4:6,810 01:4:3,690 --> 01:4:9,570 sometimes and unite hey I can't 01:4:6,800 --> 01:4:9,570 01:4:6,810 --> 01:4:11,700 articulate this or I feel like I'm you 01:4:9,560 --> 01:4:11,700 01:4:9,570 --> 01:4:14,640 know I'm not conveying the idea that I'm 01:4:11,690 --> 01:4:14,640 01:4:11,700 --> 01:4:16,050 trying to convey cetera or sometimes I 01:4:14,630 --> 01:4:16,050 01:4:14,640 --> 01:4:18,150 will just send it to them and be like 01:4:16,040 --> 01:4:18,150 01:4:16,050 --> 01:4:19,800 can you read this and then tell me what 01:4:18,140 --> 01:4:19,800 01:4:18,150 --> 01:4:22,110 your understood which is also very 01:4:19,790 --> 01:4:22,110 01:4:19,800 --> 01:4:24,510 helpful to see if what they understand 01:4:22,100 --> 01:4:24,510 01:4:22,110 --> 01:4:27,030 is what I wanted to say so this is how I 01:4:24,500 --> 01:4:27,030 01:4:24,510 --> 01:4:30,830 am come and feedback in my process how 01:4:27,020 --> 01:4:30,830 01:4:27,030 --> 01:4:33,870 would have you thought about developing 01:4:30,820 --> 01:4:33,870 01:4:30,830 --> 01:4:36,150 ideas and language around your work 01:4:33,860 --> 01:4:36,150 01:4:33,870 --> 01:4:38,670 things like metacognition things like 01:4:36,140 --> 01:4:38,670 01:4:36,150 --> 01:4:40,170 thinking about thinking a brand like 01:4:38,660 --> 01:4:40,170 01:4:38,670 --> 01:4:42,630 nest labs how do you actually think 01:4:40,160 --> 01:4:42,630 01:4:40,170 --> 01:4:44,370 about to go back to the beginning of the 01:4:42,620 --> 01:4:44,370 01:4:42,630 --> 01:4:48,360 conversation the things that you're 01:4:44,360 --> 01:4:48,360 01:4:44,370 --> 01:4:50,070 actually known for how deliberate has 01:4:48,350 --> 01:4:50,070 01:4:48,360 --> 01:4:52,830 that process been or has it been 01:4:50,060 --> 01:4:52,830 01:4:50,070 --> 01:4:55,440 emergent and then assuming it has been 01:4:52,820 --> 01:4:55,440 01:4:52,830 --> 01:4:59,790 somewhat deliberate how do you help 01:4:55,430 --> 01:4:59,790 01:4:55,440 --> 01:5:4,080 yourself navigate into new waters that 01:4:59,780 --> 01:5:4,080 01:4:59,790 --> 01:5:8,370 are inside of terms and ideas and sand 01:5:4,070 --> 01:5:8,370 01:5:4,080 --> 01:5:10,590 boxes that you are actually creating 01:5:8,360 --> 01:5:10,590 01:5:8,370 --> 01:5:13,920 yourself rather than ones created by 01:5:10,580 --> 01:5:13,920 01:5:10,590 --> 01:5:17,300 other people yeah I think it's very 01:5:13,910 --> 01:5:17,300 01:5:13,920 --> 01:5:20,610 similar to the concept of diffused and 01:5:17,290 --> 01:5:20,610 01:5:17,300 --> 01:5:22,740 diffuse and focused thinking where when 01:5:20,600 --> 01:5:22,740 01:5:20,610 --> 01:5:25,200 you're thinking you basically always 01:5:22,730 --> 01:5:25,200 01:5:22,740 --> 01:5:27,390 alternate between being super focused 01:5:25,190 --> 01:5:27,390 01:5:25,200 --> 01:5:29,550 like refocus you're trying to solve the 01:5:27,380 --> 01:5:29,550 01:5:27,390 --> 01:5:31,950 problem actively you're in front of the 01:5:29,540 --> 01:5:31,950 01:5:29,550 --> 01:5:33,810 question you're trying to crack it and 01:5:31,940 --> 01:5:33,810 01:5:31,950 --> 01:5:36,170 sometimes it works and sometimes it 01:5:33,800 --> 01:5:36,170 01:5:33,810 --> 01:5:39,480 doesn't and then you leave it away and 01:5:36,160 --> 01:5:39,480 01:5:36,170 --> 01:5:41,490 and all of a sudden that's what we call 01:5:39,470 --> 01:5:41,490 01:5:39,480 --> 01:5:43,260 shower thoughts you just you're like Oh 01:5:41,480 --> 01:5:43,260 01:5:41,490 --> 01:5:45,570 Eureka I got it 01:5:43,250 --> 01:5:45,570 01:5:43,260 --> 01:5:47,370 and so that's because you let your mind 01:5:45,560 --> 01:5:47,370 01:5:45,570 --> 01:5:49,560 do the work in the background that's 01:5:47,360 --> 01:5:49,560 01:5:47,370 --> 01:5:52,110 called diffuse thinking and our brain 01:5:49,550 --> 01:5:52,110 01:5:49,560 --> 01:5:54,030 basically always alternate between focus 01:5:52,100 --> 01:5:54,030 01:5:52,110 --> 01:5:56,700 and if she's thinking and I think when 01:5:54,020 --> 01:5:56,700 01:5:54,030 --> 01:5:58,800 it comes to creativity and to do topics 01:5:56,690 --> 01:5:58,800 01:5:56,700 --> 01:6:2,040 that I've read about it's a bit similar 01:5:58,790 --> 01:6:2,040 01:5:58,800 --> 01:6:3,870 where the diffuse mode of writing would 01:6:2,030 --> 01:6:3,870 01:6:2,040 --> 01:6:5,430 be oh this is interesting 01:6:3,860 --> 01:6:5,430 01:6:3,870 --> 01:6:7,050 let me explore this I'm going to write 01:6:5,420 --> 01:6:7,050 01:6:5,430 --> 01:6:7,600 about this and I just like follow my 01:6:7,040 --> 01:6:7,600 01:6:7,050 --> 01:6:10,150 curiosity 01:6:7,590 --> 01:6:10,150 01:6:7,600 --> 01:6:12,100 and I read about it and then the focused 01:6:10,140 --> 01:6:12,100 01:6:10,150 --> 01:6:14,080 mode would be when I noticed as a 01:6:12,090 --> 01:6:14,080 01:6:12,100 --> 01:6:16,810 pattern I've been writing about similar 01:6:14,070 --> 01:6:16,810 01:6:14,080 --> 01:6:19,780 stuff for a few months and I'm like is 01:6:16,800 --> 01:6:19,780 01:6:16,810 --> 01:6:22,630 there a term that I would be able to use 01:6:19,770 --> 01:6:22,630 01:6:19,780 --> 01:6:24,670 in a more intentional way to put them in 01:6:22,620 --> 01:6:24,670 01:6:22,630 --> 01:6:26,530 their a category that both make sense 01:6:24,660 --> 01:6:26,530 01:6:24,670 --> 01:6:28,660 from my readers but will also help me 01:6:26,520 --> 01:6:28,660 01:6:26,530 --> 01:6:30,820 position myself as someone who knows 01:6:28,650 --> 01:6:30,820 01:6:28,660 --> 01:6:32,590 about it because I know about this I've 01:6:30,810 --> 01:6:32,590 01:6:30,820 --> 01:6:34,840 been really writing all of these 01:6:32,580 --> 01:6:34,840 01:6:32,590 --> 01:6:38,200 articles about it it's just not visible 01:6:34,830 --> 01:6:38,200 01:6:34,840 --> 01:6:40,300 at the moment so for me using one term 01:6:38,190 --> 01:6:40,300 01:6:38,200 --> 01:6:42,940 an umbrella term for several articles 01:6:40,290 --> 01:6:42,940 01:6:40,300 --> 01:6:45,430 that I wrote about a topic is just a way 01:6:42,930 --> 01:6:45,430 01:6:42,940 --> 01:6:47,800 to make that expertise visible to 01:6:45,420 --> 01:6:47,800 01:6:45,430 --> 01:6:49,870 readers because they're like oh she 01:6:47,790 --> 01:6:49,870 01:6:47,800 --> 01:6:52,630 wrote now you know 20 years or 25 01:6:49,860 --> 01:6:52,630 01:6:49,870 --> 01:6:54,160 articles about mindful productivity 01:6:52,620 --> 01:6:54,160 01:6:52,630 --> 01:6:58,150 specific to you so she must know about 01:6:54,150 --> 01:6:58,150 01:6:54,160 --> 01:7:0,730 it I'll ask you a tough question Tyler 01:6:58,140 --> 01:7:0,730 01:6:58,150 --> 01:7:2,770 Cowen an economist at George Mason has 01:7:0,720 --> 01:7:2,770 01:7:0,730 --> 01:7:5,260 this idea that all thinkers or regional 01:7:2,760 --> 01:7:5,260 01:7:2,770 --> 01:7:8,110 thinkers how do you think that being 01:7:5,250 --> 01:7:8,110 01:7:5,260 --> 01:7:14,830 French has influenced your writing and 01:7:8,100 --> 01:7:14,830 01:7:8,110 --> 01:7:16,450 your style of creativity I okay so the 01:7:14,820 --> 01:7:16,450 01:7:14,830 --> 01:7:17,680 bad and the good I'm going to start with 01:7:16,440 --> 01:7:17,680 01:7:16,450 --> 01:7:20,590 the bag which is something I've been 01:7:17,670 --> 01:7:20,590 01:7:17,680 --> 01:7:23,050 fighting a lot with is that if you read 01:7:20,580 --> 01:7:23,050 01:7:20,590 --> 01:7:25,600 French in French sentence system to be 01:7:23,040 --> 01:7:25,600 01:7:23,050 --> 01:7:32,320 really long we love long sentences and 01:7:25,590 --> 01:7:32,320 01:7:25,600 --> 01:7:34,540 in French and it's yeah it's it's 01:7:32,310 --> 01:7:34,540 01:7:32,320 --> 01:7:37,300 something I don't really know why but in 01:7:34,530 --> 01:7:37,300 01:7:34,540 --> 01:7:38,950 English I feel like simplicity and being 01:7:37,290 --> 01:7:38,950 01:7:37,300 --> 01:7:43,210 able to articulate something in a few 01:7:38,940 --> 01:7:43,210 01:7:38,950 --> 01:7:45,760 words is valued whereas in in French we 01:7:43,200 --> 01:7:45,760 01:7:43,210 --> 01:7:46,840 say terrific sorry language okay it 01:7:45,750 --> 01:7:46,840 01:7:45,760 --> 01:7:48,010 doesn't mean the same thing as in 01:7:46,830 --> 01:7:48,010 01:7:46,840 --> 01:7:49,690 English I think sorry I meant something 01:7:48,000 --> 01:7:49,690 01:7:48,010 --> 01:7:51,790 else in English but in French it's 01:7:49,680 --> 01:7:51,790 01:7:49,690 --> 01:7:54,250 really about decorating and making nice 01:7:51,780 --> 01:7:54,250 01:7:51,790 --> 01:7:56,170 and it makes me long and the longer 01:7:54,240 --> 01:7:56,170 01:7:54,250 --> 01:7:58,330 sometimes you can make that so make 01:7:56,160 --> 01:7:58,330 01:7:56,170 --> 01:8:0,430 sense and that has a musicality to it is 01:7:58,320 --> 01:8:0,430 01:7:58,330 --> 01:8:3,250 something that is very appreciated so 01:8:0,420 --> 01:8:3,250 01:8:0,430 --> 01:8:5,050 when I write in English I constantly 01:8:3,240 --> 01:8:5,050 01:8:3,250 --> 01:8:6,670 have to remind myself that this is 01:8:5,040 --> 01:8:6,670 01:8:5,050 --> 01:8:10,360 English and I need to cut it and I need 01:8:6,660 --> 01:8:10,360 01:8:6,670 --> 01:8:15,880 to be short and crisp etc so that's for 01:8:10,350 --> 01:8:15,880 01:8:10,360 --> 01:8:17,680 good bad for the good I I think that 01:8:15,870 --> 01:8:17,680 01:8:15,880 --> 01:8:19,960 there's a very long tradition of 01:8:17,670 --> 01:8:19,960 01:8:17,680 --> 01:8:20,500 thinkers and philosophers in France and 01:8:19,950 --> 01:8:20,500 01:8:19,960 --> 01:8:22,750 so 01:8:20,490 --> 01:8:22,750 01:8:20,500 --> 01:8:26,020 no about other countries but but 01:8:22,740 --> 01:8:26,020 01:8:22,750 --> 01:8:29,560 philosophy is a mandatory discipline 01:8:26,010 --> 01:8:29,560 01:8:26,020 --> 01:8:32,259 that you have to study from 16 to 18 so 01:8:29,550 --> 01:8:32,259 01:8:29,560 --> 01:8:34,330 it's something that every single French 01:8:32,249 --> 01:8:34,330 01:8:32,259 --> 01:8:36,160 person that went to school up until 18 01:8:34,320 --> 01:8:36,160 01:8:34,330 --> 01:8:38,560 years old had to study so we had to 01:8:36,150 --> 01:8:38,560 01:8:36,160 --> 01:8:40,690 recount and we had to reject from 01:8:38,550 --> 01:8:40,690 01:8:38,560 --> 01:8:44,529 plateaued again to depart to all of 01:8:40,680 --> 01:8:44,529 01:8:40,690 --> 01:8:46,750 these guys that was basically basic 01:8:44,519 --> 01:8:46,750 01:8:44,529 --> 01:8:49,660 readings that we had to do and I think 01:8:46,740 --> 01:8:49,660 01:8:46,750 --> 01:8:52,600 it's impossible to be a writer and 01:8:49,650 --> 01:8:52,600 01:8:49,660 --> 01:8:54,310 having been first not first I really 01:8:52,590 --> 01:8:54,310 01:8:52,600 --> 01:8:55,660 enjoyed reading these but having had to 01:8:54,300 --> 01:8:55,660 01:8:54,310 --> 01:9:0,060 read all of these from a young age to 01:8:55,650 --> 01:9:0,060 01:8:55,660 --> 01:9:2,529 not be influenced so I do value a lot 01:9:0,050 --> 01:9:2,529 01:9:0,060 --> 01:9:4,810 arguments that are explained clearly I 01:9:2,519 --> 01:9:4,810 01:9:2,529 --> 01:9:8,650 have to fight against myself to write it 01:9:4,800 --> 01:9:8,650 01:9:4,810 --> 01:9:10,509 shortly but I I get really annoyed when 01:9:8,640 --> 01:9:10,509 01:9:8,650 --> 01:9:13,259 something is vague or it doesn't make 01:9:10,499 --> 01:9:13,259 01:9:10,509 --> 01:9:16,690 sense and that's something I'm trying to 01:9:13,249 --> 01:9:16,690 01:9:13,259 --> 01:9:18,370 to really like do in my writing I will I 01:9:16,680 --> 01:9:18,370 01:9:16,690 --> 01:9:20,529 will sometimes spend a lot of time 01:9:18,360 --> 01:9:20,529 01:9:18,370 --> 01:9:22,540 rephrasing one sentence because it just 01:9:20,519 --> 01:9:22,540 01:9:20,529 --> 01:9:24,520 sounds and I never want to have 01:9:22,530 --> 01:9:24,520 01:9:22,540 --> 01:9:26,140 anything that is in my writing 01:9:24,510 --> 01:9:26,140 01:9:24,520 --> 01:9:29,259 so that's how I've been influenced by 01:9:26,130 --> 01:9:29,259 01:9:26,140 --> 01:9:32,140 French visitors that is a outstanding 01:9:29,249 --> 01:9:32,140 01:9:29,259 --> 01:9:34,750 answer one of the things that I really 01:9:32,130 --> 01:9:34,750 01:9:32,140 --> 01:9:36,730 like about studying philosophy is the 01:9:34,740 --> 01:9:36,730 01:9:34,750 --> 01:9:39,520 dialectical mode of thinking that it 01:9:36,720 --> 01:9:39,520 01:9:36,730 --> 01:9:42,580 gives you all philosophers are wrong but 01:9:39,510 --> 01:9:42,580 01:9:39,520 --> 01:9:45,520 some are useful and what you find is 01:9:42,570 --> 01:9:45,520 01:9:42,580 --> 01:9:48,220 that philosophy helps you take an idea 01:9:45,510 --> 01:9:48,220 01:9:45,520 --> 01:9:51,310 to its look to its farthest possible 01:9:48,210 --> 01:9:51,310 01:9:48,220 --> 01:9:53,259 extreme and then you just assume that 01:9:51,300 --> 01:9:53,259 01:9:51,310 --> 01:9:54,009 when you're reading a philosopher that 01:9:53,249 --> 01:9:54,009 01:9:53,259 --> 01:9:56,110 they're wrong 01:9:53,999 --> 01:9:56,110 01:9:54,009 --> 01:9:58,330 so critique is embedded into the 01:9:56,100 --> 01:9:58,330 01:9:56,110 --> 01:10:1,990 philosophical mode of discourse and what 01:9:58,320 --> 01:10:1,990 01:9:58,330 --> 01:10:4,300 you realize is that you sort of have to swing like a hammock from one philosopher then sort of get to the opposite side and it is only through that swings of like thesis antithesis synthesis of ideas that you actually begin to discover truth and I think that a lot of the harshness of social media like if you look at somebody of how they're talking on Twitter for example it tends to be very harsh it tends to me this is my opinion this is what I'm saying and in order for that not to drive you crazy you need to ask how is this wrong and how is this useful what can I learn from this idea that offends me what can I learn from this idea that sort of jarring and daunting and different from how I ordinarily think and I think that a lot of the things that are wrong in terms of public discourse is our very basically we've lost this ability to think dialectically to think of how an idea could be useful and wrong and to assume that that's the case in the first place and just to hop on people at the beginning for just being wrong and I think that a lot of what is required for interestingness is paradox and that we're taught to think of truth in terms of logic in terms of right and in terms of wrong but philosophy begins to see that a lot of truths and same with religion they begin to see that a lot of the deepest truths in humanity are rooted in paradox and is only through that mode of thinking where you can hold to ideas and your mind did not go crazy that you can actually access those kingdoms of knowledge absolutely and and it's a it's something that's actually also true of science in general and a mistake that people make a lot with science is thinking that science is finding a definite truth but when you think about it we've been going from being wrong to being less wrong but you know if we thought that we were right for science we would just stop today we're right we're done boom job finished no need to do more science or more research so the reason why science is progressing and the reason why we're progressing as humanity in general is because we're able to question whatever is being saved by other people or the beliefs of other people in a thoughtful constructive way I mean like okay this is wrong like is there a way to be less ronger is it compatible with another way of thinking or is there more to it that we didn't think about yet and you talked about paradoxes and it's just super interesting to think that one of the biggest problems in science today when like quantum physics and and I stretch line theory of relativity they're completely paradoxical so right now if you're a scientist you have to believe two things are true they're both valid so far as we know and we have to live with this paradox and so I absolutely agree with you that to me being able to make progress either in public discourse or in science or really in anything as human beings is being about being able to hold to ideas that may seem contradictory and our mind at the same time and to examine them without going completely crazy yes absolutely to return to something a bit more practical how do you think about distributing your work so you've published your work but there isn't a if I write this they will read this idea online how do you actually think about distribution I know you have the community I know you have the newsletter what else you focused on and how would you summarize your frameworks that you're using to actually get your ideas out into the world yeah so basically it really depends at what stage the idea is at if the idea is very very early very half-baked and I'm not quite sure if I'm going to write it yet it's going to be shared as the tweet then if I have a little bit more thoughts is going to be in my public notebook and then if I have something a little bit more you know I worked on for a little bit longer it's going to be on the blog she distribute the articles or on the blog I have several channels the very first one the most important one and the one where it always goes there for sure is my newsletter so this is the you know I have this kind of like contract with my readers that they don't have to worry about following me on Twitter or trying to catch like whatever I'm publishing everywhere if there's subscribe to the newsletter they know they're not going to miss anything so that's really for me the main color then I post in some communities sometimes but I'm being very mindful about it and it's really only about only in case the topic is very relevant to what that community cares about so I don't right that much about these topics anymore but when I used to write about writing newsletters very meta I would post for example in the news area group because that would be relevant to them so that kind of stuff and then I always tried to make sure that I can expand my reader base because if I only posted by a my newsletter or the groups that I'm a part of or on Twitter I would just kind of keep on engaging with the same people maybe a few new people but it would still be mainly targeted at my existing audience so I also post in other places such as in my case pretty relevant not relevant for everyone but unhappy news so on other platforms exist or a public sometimes on indie hackers etc where I know that entrepreneurs are hanging out and that's because my in my audience I have lots of knowledge workers engineers and entrepreneurs but I guess if someone is writing about another topic like gardening or whatever they would post in firms that are more relevant to what they're writing about so yeah I try to make sure to have a healthy mix of directly sending these to my audience but also using channels that have people there that don't know me yet so I can keep on growing my community I've seen you begin to incorporate visuals into your writing sort of like the bucket that we saw today how have you thought about incorporating visuals where are you taking inspiration from and what are you using to get better at that yeah I am I actually started doing this with the second or third article I ever published on unless slap so I've been doing this since the very beginning um I think first okay the very first reason I did this was very practical the very first time I did it it was because I needed something to show up on social media when I was posting it I mean in a visual here and I just thought that was interesting real estate and that instead of putting a random picture I could put something that was really about the content of what I wrote about but then I started realizing that these were super helpful to capture an idea and sometimes I actually use these in parallel writing I will be writing and I will be struggling to formulate an idea and I will stop for a second just try them and draw it a neck if I can put it in this little illustration it means that it's pure in my head so there's this dialogue sometimes between the illustration and the article itself and then the reason why I kept on doing them is because I get lots of positive feedback from readers who tell me that they're super helpful so I keep on using them in terms of improving they're fairly simple so it's not like you know I make them in Google slides by the way they're not I'm not using any special software so if anyone here wants to also do cool illustrations you can just do them in Google Sites if you don't want to invest in software um I I just like I just try to you know again I read content where I see some of these like I know that James Kerr has some of them for example so I think by just making sure that I consume content that has nice visuals like it just gives you inspiration but because for me the visuals are not the main thing I'm trying to improve its my writing I definitely don't have a creative creativity system as polished as I have for my writing so it's more about reading illustrating books and reading blogs that have these etc and I and I I'm letting the diffuse mode of my brain doing the job here I'm not trying to control it I think that there's a theme here of clarity in that hmm once you begin to switch mediums your brain can actually see what you're trying to say in new ways and it actually I just realized this in the same way that conversation can get us unstuck the same thing you can do is just switch mediums and also you can switch context to you can go from thinking in your office to thinking on a walk to thinking in a coffee shop and by then switching the places that you are working through ideas you are then removing the blockers from your brain so what I would think of here is a lot of ideas the way that your brain works tends to be like a maze and what happens is you have in one part of your brain the original seed of an idea and in the other parts you have this basically where you want to end up and when you think through an idea you have to traverse through this maze but you end up getting stuck you run it to some dead-end here whoo got to go back then you go oh wow if some momentum whoo got to go back and so then you're trying to get to that end point but every single time that you switch contacts every single time you have an interesting conversation every single time that you switch mediums like going from writing to drawing you begin to lower the walls in your maze that then allows you to get from point A to point B faster absolutely I actually wrote an article about this and I call it mindful context switching because I think it's very important you know that it's not the same as multitasking multitasking is doing two different tasks that have nothing to do together at the same time really bad really unproductive you're not going you're basically going to do a bad job at both of them whereas mindful context fiction which is exactly what you described is I still have the same goal I still have the same task I'm just going to approach it from a slightly different angle and for example I have a friend who's actually writers she published a book and she's writing on her second book for hurt her mindful context switching method is that if she comes right in if she's stuck she will take her voice note recorder from her phone and talk to herself and try to explain the idea to herself and it has an automatic transcription thing in it so she can then just read the transcript and like oh actually that's exactly what I wanted to say weird that I couldn't do it while writing but I could just say no yes definitely mindful context switching is super helpful yeah I'll take you and go one further so in write a passage we have on Saturdays we do this thing called CrossFit for writing where everybody in the course we all get together and we go from start to finish on an article in two hours and so it's a nine step framework that I developed for doing that I know it sounds ludicrous for the average person to be able to do that that fast but what we do is we sit down with notes and then you go through a C of conversations where you have a conversation explain it to somebody else then you write it and what's interesting is the brain evolved to learn how to read and write quite late we've only learned how to do this in the last 500 years and even after Gutenberg invented the printing press only a small percentage of people could read and write and those who did like Martin Luther who wrote the 95 theses had a huge impact because books were so scarce my point in saying this is that speaking and thinking of ideas in speech is rooted much deeper into it in terms of the evolution of human consciousness so what you realize is in CrossFit for writing what we do by forcing people to speak it helps you structure ideas which you can't do when you're just sitting down on the page so what we do is we give people these 2 to 5 minute blocks to just talk through their ideas and then we say go right back to the page and write down exactly what you said and through the process of speaking to interesting things happened I mentioned the idea that it automatically structures ideas for you but the other one that our students realize is when you speak the things that you don't mention when you can still convey an idea those are the things that you should delete so by virtue of speaking you know both how to structure your essays and what to delete from them which is why the system works so well this is an amazing method and and I think this is why lots of people find it helpful to you just have a chat with someone when they're stuck so you know I I've never heard about it used it for writing this is really cool well on Laura thank you very much this was utterly fantastic and exceeded all my expectations and I say that I had big expectations because I'm a huge fan of your work so thank you very much thanks so much for having me bye everybody
