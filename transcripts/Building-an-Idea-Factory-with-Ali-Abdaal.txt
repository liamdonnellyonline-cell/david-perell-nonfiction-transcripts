uh so i am thrilled to be hosting one of the fastest growing youtubers on planet earth right now ali abdul he is somebody who's become a friend somebody who i think is just doing absolutely exceptional work and the two of us today are going to be talking about how to build an idea factory how to build a system a way of life a way of thinking a way of being that has new ideas pouring through your veins each and every day and now it's time to meet our guest of honor ali abdull calling in from the united kingdom hey everyone how's it going thank you very much dave well and rebecca for having me in a moment i will uh commence my presentation everyone joining us on the youtube live stream welcome as well uh there is a link in the youtube live stream video description to join us in the actual webinar if you would like because then you can actually ask questions because i'm not going to be looking at the youtube chat i'm afraid but if for some reason you don't want to join the zoom webinar you can watch the live stream anyway thank you very much uh for having me here and you guys can see my screen right we're going to kick off this session on building an idea factory and this is something that i'm very excited to chat to you guys about and to be collaborating with david on um he and i approach it from different angles david obviously does a lot of writing i do a lot of youtubing and but i think what underlies both activities is this thing of having an idea factory so this is how i usually introduce the topic when i am doing my course the part-time youtuber academy and i'm gonna sort of concretize it towards youtube specifically because that's what i know about but to be honest a lot of the things around growing on youtube and succeeding on youtube are very applicable to blogging podcasting i don't know making sculptures basically whatever art form you you care about now i want to start things off with a bit of a maths puzzle and this is a little maths puzzle from morgan housel's book the psychology of money this is our friend uh warren buffett and i want to show you two scenarios of you know applying applying some numbers to it to warren buffett's life and so um he started investing at the age of 10 and by age 30 his net worth was about a million dollars which would be close to nine million dollars inflation adjusted he's still investing at the age of 90 he's either 90 or 91 something like that he's got 22 in annual returns and his current net worth is 84.5 billion at least it was a few months ago when i made this has probably increased since then so that's that's warren buffett now let's take a more normal person let's say this normal person starts investing at the age of 30. and at age 30 the network is about 25k which is reasonable for a 30 year old in the us and let's say they quit investing at age 60 to play some golf and hang out with their kids and all that kind of stuff and let's say this person is just just as good an investor as warren buffett and is getting 22 annual returns now uh a question for the chat for the people who didn't see uh that thing that i just flashed up what do you think this person's net worth would be where the only difference is the length of time that they've been investing if you fancy posting in the uh in the chat in the youtube live chat if you guys want to get involved um the answer is 11.9 million dollars if i hadn't shown you that most people would have not got it that it was that low and and the message is there that the message there is that 99.9 plus percent of buffett's net worth is because he started early and kept going like he would be 99.9 less rich than he is now and the only thing that changes is the amount of time that he's been doing it now this is interesting because as einstein famously said compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world and buffett's story is really a story of compound interest like you know decent progress but that just happens over a very very long time and this is kind of what this graph looks like and this is very much what it takes to succeed on youtube if you look at any big youtubers or any any youtuber that you deem successful and you look at their analytics this is what the graph will look like it will be basically nothing at the start and then it will be massive compounding returns over a long period of time the annoying thing about this sort of stuff is that when it comes to our memory of of things our memory is very uh time-bound in the short term like it tends to decay over time this is uh the forgetting curve and so if you overlay these two graphs um this is a concept i got from sam evans who's a does a lot of consulting related things you kind of get these two graphs of like as as like memory starts off big and then goes down and the effect size or the success or whatever metric you want starts off small then goes big and you kind of get this weird phenomenon where you know at the start you have basically zero effect so no views no subscribers no revenue no one reading your blog post no one listening to your podcast but you have a strong memory of the amount of effort and the amount of pain it takes to create the content and that is that's not a good formula for for success right because you're not seeing anything and you're you're feeling the pain whereas when you get to sort of with me three and a half years later where you have a pretty large number of views and subscribers in revenue at this point i have very little actual memory of what it was like three and a half years ago when i first got started so i could no longer really appreciate how much hard work it was at the beginning and so if you ask me about kind of hey what's it take to succeed in youtube i'll probably make it sound a lot easier than it actually is just because that that memory has decayed and so the reason people fail is that they start a journey and can't see effect from cause immediately so they give up and quit before they reach the point where the effect starts to compound and it's the people who stick at it long enough to actually let the compounding happen they forg you know forget what what what the causes that we're responsible for for creating it and it makes them feel as if you know oh i just got lucky because i didn't i didn't realize how much hard work this was over over time and really the key message here is that if you want to succeed on youtube or any content platform or anything in life really it's about thinking of it as a marathon rather than a sprint and you know one example that i love to use is mkbhd lots of you guys are familiar with him marcus brownlee one of the biggest tech youtubers in the world he's now got like 13 14 million subscribers something like that this is this is my favorite video of his and i'm going to play this and i hope that everyone can hear the sound damn okay no one can hear the sound uh let me pantomime uh what this guy is saying oh you're right i haven't shared the audio let's do that new share share sound okay i have to say it's pretty good that i've gotten to upload a hundred good videos for you guys can you hear that perfect number 100 so yeah welcome to video number 100 um i have to say it's pretty good that i've gotten to upload 100 good videos for you guys over the past couple of months basically and so what i'm going to go into is that right now i have i'm going to check right now right now i have approximately 70 ish subscribers i'm just looking at yeah i have oh wait now if i go to my page youtube.com marcus brownlee just click on the link over there i have 74 subscribers so i was thinking marcus brownlee mkbhd one of the biggest tech youtubers in the probably a sort of multi-millionaire at this point made 100 videos and in his 100th video he said guys it's so great that i've got 76 subscribers or 74 subscribers that is absolutely insane like i know i know hundreds of people at this point who started youtube and quit before making 100 videos because i didn't see any growth and it wasn't working and marcus brownlee who is one of the most successful youtubers of our generation uh made a hundred videos before he hit 74 subscribers i just think that's always that that's like hugely inspiring um uh if i if i show you what my analytics look like now you know again this is this is the pattern of basically all all youtubers where it starts off i started making videos in june 2017. so you see i start off with nine video nine views and then i get i don't know how many views is this uh you know it's 30 views 70 views 60 views 90 views 62 i know yeah you know it's basically it's pretty tiny you can't even see the line on the graph but it's like over time as you bang out more and more and more and more videos things start to compound and then these view counts start to get interesting and so now these days it's like you know every day is a few hundred thousand and three and a half years ago when i first started with 7 17 27 views i could just never have imagined what that effect size would grow to over time and so really the key message here is that it's all about consistency and if you want to succeed on youtube if you want to succeed on a blog or writing anything or doing a podcast or doing any kind of basically anything you've got to be very very consistent over a very very long period of time and that you know if if there is a secret to consistency then that secret is that you want to try and build a system around it and there's this fantastic book called the emeth enterprise or the updated version the e-myth revisited which i i often return to it it talks about how the question you need to keep asking yourself is how can i give my customer the results he wants systematically rather than personally put another way how can i create a business who is whose results are systems dependent rather than people dependent um and i think there are this is a book about growing business but there are a lot of lessons we can learn from it and from the systems based approach to towards our own creativity and our own content did i didn't quite appreciate this until i read this book and until i started doing things like taking tiago four days course building a second brain and david parol's course right to passage and now i've kind of built these systems into my own youtube channel and now for my own youtube channel and all the content that i produce i've got this idea factory which is a systematic kind of way of combining creativity and systems to create content effortlessly and now i'm going to hand over to david who's going to talk to us much more about what it what building an idea factory actually involves and how we can go about it thanks ali so i'm gonna share my screen here and what i want to focus on is exactly what ollie said like how do we actually build this idea factory and i thought it'd be fun to take all of our inspiration today from comedians and to begin we're going to talk about the great jerry seinfeld and he says when he talks about writing in particular he says my writing sessions used to be very arduous very painful like pushing against the wind in soft muddy ground with a wheelbarrow full of bricks and this is what we feel when we sit down to write the pain the arduous battle of going uphill of maybe having writer's block or deep frustration and the way that we solve this is with an idea factory collect connect create is what we're going to focus on collecting nutrients for your mind like a chef collects food for the kitchen connecting making sense of the ideas in your head through reflection and conversation and then finally creation to put thoughts on paper and edit them until they're good and that is where we begin in the collect phase and speaking of comedians let's talk about david sedaris who says everybody's got an eye for something the only difference is that i carry around a notebook in my front pocket i write everything down and it helps me recall so that's where i want to begin today get into the habit of writing down your epiphanies i was watching a video last night with neil gaiman famous famous fiction writer who says you know everyone basically has the same amount of epiphanies the same amount of new ideas that are insightful the difference between a writer and a normal person is that writers know how to recognize those ideas and then they save those ideas but then what kind of ideas should we collect and there's really four things that we should focus on epiphanies what we read conversations and experiences and first i want to focus on epiphanies and we'll return to jerry seinfeld who says i think jokes come from a kind of intense visual acuity i feel like my senses are my eyes my ears and my skin and i just feel everything just a little bit more than i would even like to and what he's trying to say here is that his senses are just a little bit more trained a little bit more on than most people kind of drives him crazy even but what he's doing is he is using those hyper-sensitive senses to recognize what's going on in the world and to observe what's happening which then leads into his jokes and when it comes to finding new ideas i always try to remember the three b's of creativity bed bath and bus if we're looking for new ideas if i ever need to find a new idea i just go to one of these three i basically have a menu and i'll just pick so bed take a nap and let yourself dream bath relax by taking a bath reading a book or by calling a friend or bus get on the move even if you're just going for a walk and when i just need to find an idea if i can just do one of these three depending on my mood i know that i can end up finding that kind of idea and if i match the perceptiveness of seinfeld i end up discovering something but then when it comes to ideas to collect there's also reading and the question that we need to ask here is what kind of information should you consume and i think that there's three things that we want to focus on three things that i focus on in my writing and the first is first to decorate to look for knowledge and ideas that aren't often found together and so for example you're much more likely to find somebody who is a software engineer who also knows about computers and the construction of computers and how to code programs whereas somebody who's a painter and a software engineer for example that'll be much less likely that'll be more likely to be original and come to think of it that connection led to arguably one of the most famous books in silicon valley history hackers and painters by paul graham you combine two things that are seemingly disconnected that are decorated and you bring them together and when it comes to decoration i've always liked this quote from john hagarty who says the originality of an idea depends on the obscurity of sources basically saying even the things that you do see as original aren't as original as you think and speaking of youtubers now that we have one here my very favorite youtubers casey neistat and i looked at his videos and i said oh my goodness these are so original so unique so novel not so fast he was very influenced by wes anderson who's the guy here who's behind the camera famous for movies like the grand budapest hotel and wes anderson developed this whole style within the world of film and he worked from behind the camera looking into the lens shooting at the world away from him casey neistat when it came to the internet when it came to smartphones and a new way of thinking about film in the youtube generation said you know what i'm going to turn the camera around and focus it on me and what you find is what casey neistat did and i thought his ideas were just fully fully fully original and this isn't to take anything away from him but i think this random guy on reddit said it perfectly everything casey neistat shoots is inspired by wes anderson everything so what do you mean david well here are some of his shots these are wes anderson shots and you can see symmetry you can see colors you can see the way that he breaks the fourth wall you can see dramatic zooms you can see symmetrical framing these are all the things that wes anderson is known for and when it comes to casey neistat he pulled in a lot of wes anderson's symmetry so you can take this shot of casey in his office he's waving his flag he's in the middle this is something that is straight out of a wes anderson movie then you see breaking the fourth wall this is what casey neistat's doing when he's talking to the camera and you know what it's straight out of a wes anderson movie you can see the similarities looking right at the camera traveling on the go to communicate something and then there's more talking to the camera of casey neistat sitting in an emirates airplane leaning back to enjoy himself he's got his passport up front and then going back to the grand budapest hotel you could see that same sort of let's look right into the camera and let's talk to the viewer which is very different from the way that most movies are done and in this new york magazine piece about casey and his brother van neistat who used to host an hbo show it says the end products recall both a child-like wonder love of monsters and make-believe and a fetish for tangible craft stop motion animation hand lettering duct tape familiar with the aesthetic of say wes anderson and if anderson made really moving personal films about himself and so you see this translation this decoration all over the place and what i've discovered is if you decorate and if you curate a sufficiently unique information diet you end up with a combination of ideas that nobody's ever seen before so what else can we do when it comes to information consumption well we can look outside the spotlight you know i think that this right here shows that there's so many things that happen in the world on a day-to-day basis and the news the mainstream media just covers a very small fraction and you can think of the world like an intellectual spotlight where everyone's just always focused on the same things and you can look in other places who right now is talking about say the design of nuclear energy plants maybe you can go be an expert on that there's a bunch of people on youtube that i watch who study the economics of the aviation industry i see nowhere else people focusing on that and then there's a channel called long haul by simplifying that i watch all the time whenever i eat lunch they are outside of the spotlight doing something that others aren't doing and then finally escape the time bias you know what we've done is we used to have a world where information consumption was really predicated on space where you lived and now it's predicated on time what the year is what the day is what is the hour and what i mean by that is if you were to go back to an old town and you were to go to their library what you would find is a ton of books most of them weren't written this year most of them maybe not even written this decade but almost all of them from the local region back in the 17th to 18th century and that is a space bias you read stuff that pertains to where in the world you live and now what's happened is we've flipped we've done the opposite we've moved to a time bias a couple years ago i was with some youtubers and we were going to a comedy store on the in midtown manhattan called the stand and we all hopped in one of those uber suvs that you you know they sort of market them as an suv but they're just like actually big cars and you always feel like slightly ripped off when you get into them and i was sitting in the back and i just paid attention to what everybody in front of me was consuming what i noticed was every single person in this car for the 20 25 minute drive only had consumed things created in the last 24 hours they were consuming instagram stories twitter feeds facebook feeds all that sort of stuff and so rather than being focused on space they were focused on time they were consuming only things that were created in the here and now but that it those ideas they were coming from all over the world so we've gone with a flipping and so if you take seriously the structure of the internet is very get out of the here now stop reading the news so obsessively look at what is everybody else consuming and do the opposite and a little recommended video that i suggest on youtube for this is how to write a long form essay 35 minutes about how exactly i do this and now i want to move into the connect phase you know high performers they're like surfers writers youtubers comedians everything and surfers they don't spend most of their time in the waves like this they actually spend most of their time paddling and even though everybody talks about the epic wave that they caught after hours of paddling in the water well it was actually that paddling and all those hours paddling that led to the epic wave and so no matter what you do in life whatever craft you want to partake in if you're going to get good you're going to have to spend a lot of time paddling and in writing and creating when it comes to building an idea factory paddling is this connect phase and a good example of a paddler would be someone like chris rock who we all know and love and he says when i start a tour it's not like i start out in arenas before this tour i performed in this place in new brunswick new jersey called the stress factory i did about 40 or 50 shows getting ready for this tour and this place the stress factory is not a very impressive place i mean you look at this place and you're like any old schmuck could perform here it's not madison square garden where he ends up performing later on but it was those 40 or 50 shows that allowed him to prepare allowed him to think about how does he develop how does he refine ideas so that by the time he gets to midtown new york he can shine like the sun and that reminds me of the content triangle you know there's many different ways to write and the way that many people think about writing is i need to escape i need to leave i need to abandon society get rid of all distractions every single paying every single notification every single distraction is killing my work it is bothering me and i just need to be like henry david throw who in the mid 19th century went went to weldon pond outside of massachusetts outside of boston and he lived here for two years and after that experience he ended up with a book called walden but this whole walden ponding idea it just doesn't work anymore the world it's moved on from that we need a different strategy when it comes to building an idea factory that systematically helps us get more out of the time and the energy that we put into life and that allows us to develop ideas in a way that is repeatable in a way a meta framework that we can apply to youtube that we can apply to comedy that we can apply to writing and i call this the content triangle and it starts with conversation so whereas most people see the first draft the book that you publish is this end result and that first draft is like the f that book is like the first draft your thoughts i say do something else start off in conversation we have conversations all the time in our life we go out to lunch we go out to dinner we see our roommates we see friends we call our parents on the phone and where most people think of conversation as something that it's just for fun i'm challenging you to see it as a way to start developing your a way to structure and organize and think clearly because you're getting feedback from other people all the time what's exciting what's confusing what's interesting what's entertaining and then what happens is you have a good and you find something that's worth sharing and maybe you share it your email newsletter maybe you share it on twitter or something and you just type it up and then all of a sudden you see how people react so now you're getting a second level of both certainty that that idea is interesting and you're getting more feedback that you can use to refine what you're saying so say it works well on email or on twitter now maybe you publish an article about it and every single time you're creating you're sharing you're getting feedback creating sharing getting feedback you're always iterating and refining and then at the end when you publish your book what you've done is you've actually had multiple attempts you've gone through multiple iterations and you've had multiple people saying this is interesting this is confusing this is how you can improve your ideas when it comes to chris rock morgan housel said one newspaper profiled these small club sessions it described rock thumbing through pages of notes and fumbling with material i'm going to have to cut some of these jokes he says mid-skit the good jokes you see on netflix are the tales that stuck out out of a universe of hundreds of attempts but in order to do this well you need honest feedback and jerry seinfeld says that stand-up comics receive a score on what they're doing more often and more critically than any human on earth even a pitcher in baseball he's on the mound for an hour and 20 minutes straight having his pitches judged by the umpire every opinion the audience gives you is a hundred percent accurate and so that's what we need in our writing we need in any creative endeavor to find that honest feedback that can help us improve but then how do you actually find new ideas well chris rock says when trying to write comedy don't try don't bother trying to be funny just be a reporter look for what's sticking out and then look for the question that hasn't been asked and what you do here is you do something that i call fracking for ideas now i'm not an oil engineer so forgive me if i miss anything but basically what the way that fracking works is you go into the ground and you find like a little rock where you think that there will be oil and you cut sideways you crack open the rock you suck out the oil and it goes kind of like a slurpee back up to the surface that is then how you get your oil we can actually do the same thing when it comes to discovering ideas where we can start with an original idea we can ask why a couple times we can try to explore that idea go deeper and this is sort of like the depth of an expert but then we then cut over we find a unique thesis and we end up with something that makes the reader the viewer the attendee the participant say huh i've never thought of that before we end up with a unique thesis so what do you mean david well let me give you an example from my essay peter teo's religion probably the most successful essay i've ever written and i started off with this idea about peter thiel famous investor that he is a contrarian and the whole word contrarian is sort of upstream from teal and i knew that in college he was influenced by a guy named renee gerard it was one of his professors in college and teal spoke at gerard's funeral but a lot of people knew that and then i kept on diving in sort of like an expert would and really began to explore and i said okay jordan gerard is famous for memetic theory and teal's book is zero to one kind of builds off a medic theory once again a lot of people knew that i didn't really have a negative insight here but then i said now this is interesting this is the variant perception that other people don't have that i can build upon and that is that memetic theory is upstream from christianity and if you follow the logical the logical steps of this what you realize is that teal's investment framework is all upstream from his belief in christianity and i end up with something that is an insightful idea by fracking into this idea and trying to find a different way of thinking about how to do this ali quick question do you have any comments that you want to share here or should i keep rolling yeah i think yeah this reminds me of this whole like originality thing and there was there's an idea that i i like which is that you know as we've talked about there is nothing that's ever truly original and it's just when you apply when you apply the lens of your own personality but also the you your own your own influences and the stuff that you've read you get to something that that looks like it's original and so for me i i i found that for ages before i started i started my blog i was really worried about this idea of originality but what i've kind of come to realize is that as long as if i've if i've taken an idea from somewhere as long as i can apply a personal story or personal anecdote from my own life even that that lens with which i view the idea changes it into something original and there's a great quote that i like which is that uh there are no unique messages only unique messengers um i think with your article what you've done there is you've actually found a unique message like a unique framing of the thing i've tried that so often to try and find a unique framing and i feel like i just have zero original ideas and so my way of trying to be a bit more unique is just leaning more into the personality side and so if anyone's anyone's listening and you and you're also in that position that i was where i feel like i really don't have any novel insights like i don't read particularly novel sources of information i think one thing i find helpful is just to remember as as an individual the fact that you are writing or speaking or saying is what gives it an element of originality absolutely thank you so with that i want to pop in to create and i think that in some ways we can actually build upon what ali was saying personality here and we can think about how do we incorporate that and i want to talk about that a little bit later but i'm very inspired by this this image from picasso i think it's just beautiful because it just describes the creative process so well so picasso is doing here is he's trying to find the essence of a bowl he's trying to say how do i show what a bull is like in as few lines as possible to make every single stroke on the page relevant and necessary but what he does is he starts off in the top left corner by just making a simple drawing and what happens which i find to be just so beautiful is the way that the first couple drawings of the bowl are actually more complicated than the original one because this is what happens when we get into a creative mode when we're building on this idea of factories we have some kind of epiphany we say that's where i want to end up and we begin and things just get more complicated we begin to add stuff we put things on the page and we realize oh my goodness there's all these things that i never saw and then we sort of add and then only later do we begin to subtract to eliminate the non-essential and end up with something like the essence of a bull and what you can see is there are really two modes of creativity there's divergence where we expand and we just add new ideas and then there's convergence where we subtract and we take away the unnecessary and i think that a beautiful example is this cover from stripe where you can see for this book working in public what happens is over time now you can see they're sort of settled on the colors not quite settled on the shapes now they find this shape here they really begin to hone into designs and once they land here they're really onto something then they make small little adjustments okay we're going to figure it out we're going to figure it out this is what they end up with and what you see is at the beginning of that you end up with a lot of divergence they kind of find these orange and yellows and blues this the color with all the or the shape with all the lines and then they really begin to go into this and that is how a lot of creativity happens even in writing so here's seinfeld and he's talking about divergence in the writing process here and then convergence in the editing process and he sells he says when you're writing you want to treat your brain like a toddler it's just all nurturing and loving and supportiveness and then when you look at it the next day you want to be a hard ass and you just switch back and forth between treating your brain like a toddler and holding it and treating it gently and then you're being a real hard ass on your editing self you're saying no that doesn't belong get that out of here that is not relevant what you do right there is divergence and convergence right you comfort the toddler then you critique the adult so when it comes to divergence what i say when it comes to actually writing maybe writing a script for youtube maybe writing an article i say you know what don't write from a blank sheet of paper when i wrote my essay news in the age of abundance i had about 9 000 words of pent-up notes before i even started writing this thing now i wanted it to be about a 15 000 word essay so don't not write because you don't have 9 000 words of notes which is something like 20 pages here but that's what i needed to write that essay about 9 000 words and then i got to the point where i had so many notes that i couldn't even help but write it was like the obvious next step it would have been criminal and then what i do a lot of times is you know here's a fun game for yourself go out we were talking about conversation earlier with the content triangle and you can do this today okay well just make a game for yourself go out call a friend after this talk to a co-worker come up with some idea that you want to make something about and in five minutes describe the idea to them and then pay attention to what they say back what was insightful what was engaging what was confusing change the things that were confusing double down on the things that were insightful something was engaging keep drilling on that idea and then come home or just do this alone give yourself a three minute timer to write or to speak into this app called otter which will automatically transcribe your ideas three-minute timer and what you'll find is your ideas will get naturally structured where you'll see once you're forced to actually speak out your ideas you'll naturally find the beginning the middle the end and when it comes to improving your writing the best thing to do is just to try to bring in as much of the natural talking inclination that we have and what you're doing is you are writing by talking and i like this because writing is something that we've only developed in the last 500 years whereas talking is something that we've done for tens of thousands of years and so by focusing on talking instead of writing you're taking advantage of the gifts of evolution that people who are just fully only writing they aren't really taking advantage of and so then you get your idea transcribed you have it on the page and then it's time to edit and to refine jury jerry seinfeld says what's in front of me is i'm usually about is usually 20 15 or 20 pages of stuff that's in various stages of development and then there's a smaller book of just really really random things what he's saying is that when he sits down to write he just has all these ideas sprawled out over the place and he's writing from abundance just like my notes just like when you sit down and you talk and you get that idea transcribed now you have a lot of stuff you can just write from there and then you move into you guessed it the convergence phase right because if writing is thinking rewriting is rethinking and i love what seinfeld says about this that as any writer can tell you it's 95 rewrite that convergence phase lasts a long time and what i say is that there's really three knives of this editing process you know you're sort of cutting things out but just like in the kitchen you have different knives for different foods that you make different reasons that you make them you would never use a steak knife to cut a tomato and you would never use a butter knife to cut a steak you say you know what there's axe mode there's knife mode there's chisel mode and axe mode is sort of the first stage of the editing process in anything where you cut large sections in big blocks of test you do this in a movie and a youtube video in an essay knife mode is you remove unnecessary words and sentences so that you can then create a logical flow right you're zooming in you're focused on more specifics and then in chisel mode you're making these small cosmetic adjustments right before you publish now i want to make one thing very clear when you write talk and use talking to help you write but even though talking should help you write don't just write like you talk let me explain why when it comes to speaking you actually have a certain range in your voice that you can use to communicate what you're saying that you don't have in writing so for example a lot of us did this when we were kids we get home from school we get mom's car and mom says hey son how was say david how was school today and one day i go great and the next day i go great two totally different meanings in words but on the page you just read great and you don't actually get the dynamic range of expression in writing and this is why you can't just write like you talk so what you need to do is you need to diversify your vernacular and the key to do that is to both optimize for word clarity and word diversity and so if you can focus on clarity and then have a bunch of different words throughout your article where you're really using the diversity of the english language in order to communicate that is the stuff of good writing and i think that there's three kinds of words in english there are words that people know and say there's words that people know but don't say and then there's words that people don't know but don't say and this category of words that people know but don't say is our sweet spot when it comes to good writing and so an example here is you could have like the word good you could have particular and then you could have punch punctilis and people say the word good particular is a word that people would still say they don't say nearly as often as they would say good nobody knows what punk to list for what what that word means and no one really says that word it's kind of confusing and so that that's why rather than using good we want to use the word particular but not punctulous another example in words to use is nice cordial and copacetic nice is fine but it's not a very descriptive word what i love about the word cordial is it's a word that people would say but they don't say that often but it's a word that everybody knows cordial it's so specific but copacetic i have no idea what that word means and you could even go from words to phrases and what phrases should we use when we're angry well you could say that somebody's pissed off but people say this all the time or you could say that somebody had a fever of rage that's good writing it's a phrase that people don't know don't really use but they instantly understand what you mean that's that kind of creates an originality of vocabulary but then you could say that somebody was as red as a banksia and people don't know what a banksia is and don't really understand at least i didn't know what that was it's a red flower and then you could do the same thing with descriptions you could talk about two people who are dating and you could say that they're falling in love or you could say okay what is one person what would they say about the other about why they like them and maybe you could say in terms of phrases that people know and say that they were funny and confident fine but then something that people don't really say but instantly understand is something like they had a really good flirt to roast ratio you know it's hilarious it's just a funny description they were flirty they also roasted you everyone knows what this means puts a smile on your face that's good writing but you would never want to say equal parts haughty and risible because that's just too complicated and the problem is when we try to write for english teacher we end up with these fancy words that people don't understand that people don't know that people don't say whereas what we should really strive to do is find ways of describing the world that are fresh that are unique that are novel that are original that are instantly understood but at the same time we've never heard those descriptions before and then just back to pissed off fever of rage as red as a banksia this is what we don't want to use the banksia we want to use fever of rage and pissed off it's just a little too common we've heard that before so for that i recommend an article that i wrote called diversify your vernacular and to return to divergence and convergence and jerry seinfeld i think that what we should just remember here and this is where i'll close is that what you're attempting to do is is incredibly difficult when it comes to writing it's one of the most difficult things there is way harder than weight training way harder what you're summoning trying to summon within your brain and your spirit to create something onto a blank page and so this is a noble pursuit that you're doing with divergence and convergence and in order to build your idea factory you collect connect and create over to you ali amazing thank you very much david let's switch back to this back to that all right so we've established at this point that we need consistency to you know succeed in any of these in these areas of life and one way of getting consistency is by building this idea factory and david's talked a lot how the best creators the best comedians the best artists will be doing a lot of exploration a lot of generating ideas capturing ideas from different sources and how nothing is really original it just depends on the obscurity of your sources and i want to take this and i want to show you how i personally use these principles um in the idea factory for my own youtube channel so the problem of ideas is is is this thing of you know i talk to a lot of people who want to start who want to start youtube want to start a blog and one of the common objections after i'm worried what my friends and family will think is i don't know what i'm going to write about or i don't know what i'm going to make videos about like what if i run out of ideas and i used to have this problem up until recently well not recently up until a couple years ago when i sort of stumbled onto this uh concept that i called the idea generation machine and it's basically a way of you know ensuring that your idea factory never ever ever runs out of ideas because there is always an infinite number of things that you can write about or you can make videos about and there's two components to it this capture and generate and i want to give you a preview of some of the techniques that i personally use uh all six are techniques that i use almost every every day to generate ideas for my youtube channel and for my blog and email newsletter and all of these things um but i want to talk in particular about the first three eureka moments the birdsong technique and coal mining and i'll blitz through those so we've got some time for q a at the end now what is a eureka moment a eureka moment is when you're in the shower and you just have an idea uh and you're like oh my god i've got the sick idea it's great it's going to be a great idea for a video that is how i get maybe five percent of my ideas and the key thing about eureka moments is that uh we want to follow david allen's advice from getting things done they are stress free productivity which is that your brain is for having ideas not for holding them and so the idea there is as soon as we come up you know when you're in this creator mode and you switch away from just being a consumer to start being a creator anytime we come across any idea for anything at all that we could write about or make a video about it has to be written down somewhere i even have a notebook in the shower like a waterproof notebook that is for writing ideas down it's now got loads of mold on it because i only really used it once because then i got disgusted by the fact that it had so much more than it but you know the idea was there i was channeling my inner david allen to have a place to write down ideas in the shower and um the way i approach this these days is by using notion as my home base for storing video ideas it doesn't really matter what app you use feel free to use notion roam evernote onenote obsidian remnant i'm struggling to name more of these notes there's like zillions of them apple notes it doesn't really matter microsoft word google docs who cares the point is when you get an idea it needs to go straight into the home base otherwise that idea is going to decay and we're going to forget about things and it's not very good um a bit of practical a bit of a practical point notion's a bit slow so normally you know i i personally use the app drafts and things to store things and then i put them into notion but again the app doesn't really matter i'm just mentioning these because people always say what app do you use for your to-do list what app do you use for note-taking the answer is these three for the most part so that's eureka moments that's that's a bit of a cop out that's like well you know you're saying well have some original ideas and write them down yes that makes up about five percent of my content um around 45 of my content comes from these other two techniques the birdsock technique and coal mining um and they're really it's really all a solution to this issue of i have no original ideas which is a thought that i feel on a daily basis pretty much i lie awake in bed at night thinking i have no original ideas i'm writing a book at the moment about meaningful productivity but i have no original idea so like you know what am i gonna do this feels feels scary it feels bad the solution is to steal like an artist and actually this is one of my favorite books of all time i actually have a physical copy on my desk along with a physical copy of show your work both are books show your work in particular that have changed my life but still like an artist by austin cleon is just absolutely wonderful and i'm gonna steal some ideas from here like verbatim how to look at the world this is how the book starts every artist gets asked the question where do you get your ideas the honest artist answers i steal them how does an artist look at the work for a world first you figure out what's worth stealing and then you move on to the next thing that's about all there is to it when you look at the world this way you stop worrying about what's good and what's bad there's only stuff worth stealing and stuff not worth stealing everything is up for grabs if you don't find something worth stealing today you might find it worth stealing tomorrow or a month or year or a year from now and as david bowie famously said the only art i'll ever study is stuff that i can steal from and this fully describes my entire process for coming up with ideas for videos and stealing ideas from other sources is how my channel has become successful and anyone else can do the same because you don't need original ideas i have no original ideas you just need to steal them here's another one nothing is original the writer jonathan lethem has said that when people call something original nine out of ten times they just don't know the references or the original sources involved what a good artist understands is that nothing comes from nowhere all creative work builds on what came before nothing is completely original it's right there in the bible the book of ecclesiastes chapter number nine uh chapter number one verse number nine there is nothing new under the sun um everything that needs to said has already been said but since no one was listening everything must be said again and i really like this if we're free from the burden of trying to be completely original we can stop trying to make something from nothing and we can embrace influence instead of running away from it uh what is originality undetected plagiarism again speaks to the power of stealing ideas citing your sources and kind of putting your own spin on them but again i have no original ideas my youtube channel has been making two or three videos a week for the last three and a half years and we've got like another 200 video ideas in notion that we're in the process of creating you don't need original ideas to be successful in this kind of creator space or to be successful in whatever you do and there's a a method that i uh just semi jokingly referred to as the birdsong technique for doing this now what is the birdsong technique uh the birdsong technique is the idea that um if like you know we all we all walk around and you know if you're in a nice place you might hear the sound of the birds but for most of us me included you just think oh the birds are chirping that's kind of nice but there are some people who make it a point to study birdsong and apparently once you've done a little bit of practice with this you can actually identify what the different birds are by their song and then now that you've unlocked this aspect of your brain now when you hear birdsong it's not like random random ass birds are singing it's more like oh there's a robin over there and a sparrow over there and a crow over there and i'm running out of birds that i can name but you know you you're able to find the patterns and find the interestingness in what most other people would just think is random ass bird songs and so this is how i i think about it when it comes to the content that i consume because once you become a creator and once you give yourself permission to use that label even if you haven't created anything yet you can still use that label for yourself once you've once you've got that internal shift at that point everything that we consume becomes stuff that we can steal ideas from and become stuff that we can we can create so while to most of the world scrolling through twitter looks like scrolling through twitter for creators scrolling through twitter looks like let me find as many ideas as i can possibly steal and it just slightly changes the way your way of looking at the world so then you start finding inspiration and start finding influences everywhere if you're an artist you start seeing inspiration everywhere in art if you're a writer you start seeing the inspiration everywhere it's that shift from consumer to creator that um lets you do this kind of stuff and so uh we all have these kind of various places where we consume stuff twitter podcasts books articles physical books god forbid um netflix tv shows and the way that i think of it is that okay anytime i consume something that is worth stealing an idea from i want to chuck it straight into notion or into whatever app that i've got so that i've got it stored as a video idea and that means that i'm never ever going to run out of ideas to make videos about because you know twitter for example has an endless feed there are endless numbers of podcasts and books and articles and netflix shows and stuff being created i will always have a source of ideas um i've got a video called called the magical insight logging framework it talks about how you can automatically capture things from kindle highlights from insta paper highlights podcast highlights chuck them into an app called read-wise check them into notion i'm sure someone will link that in the chat if they feel like it but i want to kind of show you a little a live demo of what this looks like so i'm basically going to go so i've got my kind of video ideas page on notion which i've made just for this and we're going to see if we can kind of come up with some idea some video ideas purely based on scrolling through my feed on twitter here we go here's one mark spuntop i have no idea who this guy is um but do you journal if so what are the benefits and what's your process for journaling okay that's kind of interesting so potentially video about trying journaling and i'll just paste a link to that tweet great so we've got one idea already from my twitter feed oh hello david parrell here's ed sheehan sheeran i think you mean your earlier writing will be like dirty water the more you're right you're cleaner your creative water will be um that is an interesting tweet that i would look at that and think ah okay oh hello it's part of a thread then innovate oh i can literally steal that completely completely wholesale imitate then innovate but i'd be thinking about okay what am i what what's what's the title of that video gonna be um the secret to creativity um the secret uh i don't know to content to consistent content i wouldn't call it an imitate and innovate because on youtube a title like with a title like that probably won't work but basically david has created for me a lovely blog post which he is then turned into a twitter thread and i literally just go through his twitter thread and just apply my own spin to it i can use that concept of imitate and then innovate and i can talk about how as a youtuber basically i was trying to imitate peter mckinnon um i can talk about how i wanted to be the peter mckinnon of med school i can talk about how therefore i started changing my personality and trying to be a bit more charismatic on camera and starting using words like wasteman and incorporating coffee into my vlogs and all these things and now over the last three three and a half years of doing this i've managed to find my own style but it came from imitation originally and then thanks to david perrell on his twitter account giving me all these sources i can just oh great look at this oh no that's for me i can i can use this ed sheeran quote i can use this thing from julian shapiro i can use everything that david has very kindly collated for me and obviously i'll give him a hat tip and say hey sign up to write a passage affiliate link in the video description but the point is i'm basically stealing from david and he's just appeared on my twitter feed let's find someone else kindness of people aha james clear the more you move the easier it is to keep moving maintain the momentum interesting idea i can't think of the top of my head what that would become a video about but stumbling on happiness um left or right everything in life is remix find things to combine yeah okay when you follow someone on twitter you choose who influences your thinking here are people i'm testing out this month that's an interesting idea that's an idea about sort of curating an information diet um and then i can talk about how sort of being selective about twitter follows um podcasts um books articles helps me be the person i want and create the stuff i want and i can link to his tweets and now i know when it comes to making a video about this i will have julian's tweet that that says it so you guys kind of get the idea this is the birdsong technique this is literally you know i've scrolled about through 20 tweets on my timeline i haven't prepared this and because of the people that i follow i have just stumbled across like four different video ideas and this one about imitate and innovate could probably go become part of my course as well all of these because it could definitely be email newsletters i can definitely talk about these on my podcast if i wanted to do a video about journaling that could be a fun video called i tried i tried bullet journaling for 30 days or my bullet journaling experiment or experimenting with different journaling techniques and i'm literally just making the stuff up making the stuff up on the fly but you'll see that i've got that from just scrolling through twitter for literally a few seconds so that is kind of the birdsong technique and you know i i use that not just with twitter but any article that i read any podcast i listen to i'm always you know one bit of my mind is absorbing the stuff and the other bit of my mind is thinking okay what are the ideas from here that i can steal for my own content the final bit that i want to talk about is this idea of coal mining which is basically the same thing it's just a little bit more active so the birdsong technique is like a you know i'll if if i happen to stumble across something while scrolling twitter i'll steal the idea from them but coal mining is really a more active and deliberate way of stealing ideas from people again i'm going to quote a screenshot from austin cleon start copying what you love copy copy copy copy at the end of the copy you will find yourself nobody is born with a style of voice we don't come out of the womb knowing who we are in the beginning we learn by pretending to be our heroes we learn by copying we're talking about practice here not plagiarism plagiarism is trying to pass someone else's work off as your own copying is about reverse engineering it's like a mechanic taking apart a car to see how it works um the writer wilson business said if you copy from one author it's plagiarism but if you copy from many it's research i once heard the cartoonist gary panter say if you have one person you're influenced by everyone will say you're the next whoever but if you rip off 100 people everyone will say you're so original um and so the way i think about it is where are the hot spots on the internet or elsewhere you know the books the articles the resources i'm reading this fantastic book called meanings of life by roy baumeister right now this was written 30 years ago this is a fantastic source of mining for content for my for my book and for my uh rereading the four-hour work week ah it's a bit cliche it's been done but i'm making a video about it doing a little book summary but usually when it comes to coal mining uh the way i do is if if if i stumble across a blog or something where i think oh my god i love this person's writing or i love the topic that they're writing or this would resonate with my audience then i think okay i'm gonna save this as a resource and i'm gonna start stealing ideas from it and in fact if i show you uh do i have a page where i've listed all the people that i want to want to steal from uh no not that uh come on come on come on where is it where is it where is it never mind um one of well one of them is nesslabs.com this is done written by my friend uh and lore and her articles are amazing they're about all the stuff i care about better thinking mindful productivity purposeful creativity meaningful

expectations lead to improved 01:1:57,670 --> 01:1:59,520 01:1:57,680 --> 01:2:2,720 performance in a given area great 01:1:59,510 --> 01:2:2,720 01:1:59,520 --> 01:2:4,160 okay um let's see what is what's and 01:2:2,710 --> 01:2:4,160 01:2:2,720 --> 01:2:5,599 laura writing about it her website's 01:2:4,150 --> 01:2:5,599 01:2:4,160 --> 01:2:7,039 being slow never mind 01:2:5,589 --> 01:2:7,039 01:2:5,599 --> 01:2:8,799 and i could easily do a video about the 01:2:7,029 --> 01:2:8,799 01:2:7,039 --> 01:2:10,160 pygmalion effect and how hey guys i've 01:2:8,789 --> 01:2:10,160 01:2:8,799 --> 01:2:12,160 recently come across this this thing 01:2:10,150 --> 01:2:12,160 01:2:10,160 --> 01:2:13,520 that i read on neslabs.com so giving her 01:2:12,150 --> 01:2:13,520 01:2:12,160 --> 01:2:14,799 credit and linking to her article and 01:2:13,510 --> 01:2:14,799 01:2:13,520 --> 01:2:16,160 being like this is a great blog one of 01:2:14,789 --> 01:2:16,160 01:2:14,799 --> 01:2:17,599 my favorites bloody blur she's happy 01:2:16,150 --> 01:2:17,599 01:2:16,160 --> 01:2:18,960 because i'm giving her loads of traffic 01:2:17,589 --> 01:2:18,960 01:2:17,599 --> 01:2:20,720 i'm happy because i've just stolen an 01:2:18,950 --> 01:2:20,720 01:2:18,960 --> 01:2:22,400 idea from her but then i'm 01:2:20,710 --> 01:2:22,400 01:2:20,720 --> 01:2:24,319 phrasing it in my own way and i'm trying 01:2:22,390 --> 01:2:24,319 01:2:22,400 --> 01:2:26,160 to find a story stories in my life 01:2:24,309 --> 01:2:26,160 01:2:24,319 --> 01:2:28,319 where high expectations lead to improved 01:2:26,150 --> 01:2:28,319 01:2:26,160 --> 01:2:29,760 performance for example one that just 01:2:28,309 --> 01:2:29,760 01:2:28,319 --> 01:2:32,240 randomly comes to mind is 01:2:29,750 --> 01:2:32,240 01:2:29,760 --> 01:2:34,640 when when i when i work as a doctor and 01:2:32,230 --> 01:2:34,640 01:2:32,240 --> 01:2:36,640 my senior registrar is off sick 01:2:34,630 --> 01:2:36,640 01:2:34,640 --> 01:2:38,319 and i have to act up and i have to be 01:2:36,630 --> 01:2:38,319 01:2:36,640 --> 01:2:39,760 responsible for the patience 01:2:38,309 --> 01:2:39,760 01:2:38,319 --> 01:2:41,440 that actually makes me perform better 01:2:39,750 --> 01:2:41,440 01:2:39,760 --> 01:2:42,960 because now i don't have an excuse 01:2:41,430 --> 01:2:42,960 01:2:41,440 --> 01:2:44,079 i just have to do it because they're off 01:2:42,950 --> 01:2:44,079 01:2:42,960 --> 01:2:44,640 sick and there's no one else who's going 01:2:44,069 --> 01:2:44,640 01:2:44,079 --> 01:2:46,000 to do it 01:2:44,630 --> 01:2:46,000 01:2:44,640 --> 01:2:48,160 and that's probably an example of the 01:2:45,990 --> 01:2:48,160 01:2:46,000 --> 01:2:50,000 pygmalion effect and so 01:2:48,150 --> 01:2:50,000 01:2:48,160 --> 01:2:51,760 i've stolen an idea from an lore i've 01:2:49,990 --> 01:2:51,760 01:2:50,000 --> 01:2:52,640 applied a story for myself i've google 01:2:51,750 --> 01:2:52,640 01:2:51,760 --> 01:2:54,640 defined it 01:2:52,630 --> 01:2:54,640 01:2:52,640 --> 01:2:56,319 and i could build a sort of 10 minute 15 01:2:54,630 --> 01:2:56,319 01:2:54,640 --> 01:2:57,200 minute compelling video off the back of 01:2:56,309 --> 01:2:57,200 01:2:56,319 --> 01:2:59,440 just these two 01:2:57,190 --> 01:2:59,440 01:2:57,200 --> 01:3:0,720 just these two things other websites 01:2:59,430 --> 01:3:0,720 01:2:59,440 --> 01:3:3,280 that i like um 01:3:0,710 --> 01:3:3,280 01:3:0,720 --> 01:3:5,280 barking up the wrong tree is a great one 01:3:3,270 --> 01:3:5,280 01:3:3,280 --> 01:3:7,760 eric barker's blog 01:3:5,270 --> 01:3:7,760 01:3:5,280 --> 01:3:9,359 you know literally any of these will be 01:3:7,750 --> 01:3:9,359 01:3:7,760 --> 01:3:10,960 like six things the most productive 01:3:9,349 --> 01:3:10,960 01:3:9,359 --> 01:3:11,599 people do every day i can literally rip 01:3:10,950 --> 01:3:11,599 01:3:10,960 --> 01:3:14,960 that off 01:3:11,589 --> 01:3:14,960 01:3:11,599 --> 01:3:15,520 and say five things the most productive 01:3:14,950 --> 01:3:15,520 01:3:14,960 --> 01:3:19,760 people do 01:3:15,510 --> 01:3:19,760 01:3:15,520 --> 01:3:20,559 each day and then i can make my own list 01:3:19,750 --> 01:3:20,559 01:3:19,760 --> 01:3:21,920 of five 01:3:20,549 --> 01:3:21,920 01:3:20,559 --> 01:3:23,680 and think about okay what would those 01:3:21,910 --> 01:3:23,680 01:3:21,920 --> 01:3:25,359 five be but i've got 01:3:23,670 --> 01:3:25,359 01:3:23,680 --> 01:3:27,280 eric barker's article if i ever want to 01:3:25,349 --> 01:3:27,280 01:3:25,359 --> 01:3:28,640 return to it and so 01:3:27,270 --> 01:3:28,640 01:3:27,280 --> 01:3:30,480 hopefully that's given you a bit of an 01:3:28,630 --> 01:3:30,480 01:3:28,640 --> 01:3:33,119 idea about how 01:3:30,470 --> 01:3:33,119 01:3:30,480 --> 01:3:33,920 we apply these concepts of stealing like 01:3:33,109 --> 01:3:33,920 01:3:33,119 --> 01:3:35,520 an artist 01:3:33,910 --> 01:3:35,520 01:3:33,920 --> 01:3:37,119 and just like being like shamelessly 01:3:35,510 --> 01:3:37,119 01:3:35,520 --> 01:3:39,119 stealing ideas from other people 01:3:37,109 --> 01:3:39,119 01:3:37,119 --> 01:3:41,039 but crucially applying our own lens to 01:3:39,109 --> 01:3:41,039 01:3:39,119 --> 01:3:41,599 them using examples for from our own 01:3:41,029 --> 01:3:41,599 01:3:41,039 --> 01:3:43,520 life 01:3:41,589 --> 01:3:43,520 01:3:41,599 --> 01:3:44,960 and just saying them in a way that's 01:3:43,510 --> 01:3:44,960 01:3:43,520 --> 01:3:46,880 like true to ourselves 01:3:44,950 --> 01:3:46,880 01:3:44,960 --> 01:3:48,960 and in the last like 10 minutes we've 01:3:46,870 --> 01:3:48,960 01:3:46,880 --> 01:3:49,920 just created eight different video ideas 01:3:48,950 --> 01:3:49,920 01:3:48,960 --> 01:3:51,599 and this is content 01:3:49,910 --> 01:3:51,599 01:3:49,920 --> 01:3:53,599 me for my youtube channel sorted for the 01:3:51,589 --> 01:3:53,599 01:3:51,599 --> 01:3:54,319 next month if i publish two videos a 01:3:53,589 --> 01:3:54,319 01:3:53,599 --> 01:3:58,480 week 01:3:54,309 --> 01:3:58,480 01:3:54,319 --> 01:4:1,039 so this is kind of this idea of 01:3:58,470 --> 01:4:1,039 01:3:58,480 --> 01:4:2,160 curating your content diet in a way that 01:4:1,029 --> 01:4:2,160 01:4:1,039 --> 01:4:5,119 the stuff you come across 01:4:2,150 --> 01:4:5,119 01:4:2,160 --> 01:4:5,839 is the stuff that you can write about um 01:4:5,109 --> 01:4:5,839 01:4:5,119 --> 01:4:7,039 01:4:5,829 --> 01:4:7,039 01:4:5,839 --> 01:4:8,880 one thing i'm trying to get better at 01:4:7,029 --> 01:4:8,880 01:4:7,039 --> 01:4:10,880 personally is um 01:4:8,870 --> 01:4:10,880 01:4:8,880 --> 01:4:12,720 you know trying to diversify the 01:4:10,870 --> 01:4:12,720 01:4:10,880 --> 01:4:14,160 originality or the obscurity of my 01:4:12,710 --> 01:4:14,160 01:4:12,720 --> 01:4:15,119 sources because i think one problem i 01:4:14,150 --> 01:4:15,119 01:4:14,160 --> 01:4:17,920 personally have 01:4:15,109 --> 01:4:17,920 01:4:15,119 --> 01:4:19,520 is that most of the stuff i read as as 01:4:17,910 --> 01:4:19,520 01:4:17,920 --> 01:4:20,240 david said it was was generated in the 01:4:19,510 --> 01:4:20,240 01:4:19,520 --> 01:4:22,400 last 01:4:20,230 --> 01:4:22,400 01:4:20,240 --> 01:4:24,160 for me probably not 24 hours but more 01:4:22,390 --> 01:4:24,160 01:4:22,400 --> 01:4:27,520 like in the last 12 months 01:4:24,150 --> 01:4:27,520 01:4:24,160 --> 01:4:29,359 this is the 1991 is the oldest book i've 01:4:27,510 --> 01:4:29,359 01:4:27,520 --> 01:4:31,119 read in a very long time and there's so 01:4:29,349 --> 01:4:31,119 01:4:29,359 --> 01:4:32,720 many amazing ideas in it so one thing 01:4:31,109 --> 01:4:32,720 01:4:31,119 --> 01:4:35,680 i'm actively trying to do 01:4:32,710 --> 01:4:35,680 01:4:32,720 --> 01:4:36,160 is trying to find things that are older 01:4:35,670 --> 01:4:36,160 01:4:35,680 --> 01:4:39,200 01:4:36,150 --> 01:4:39,200 01:4:36,160 --> 01:4:42,559 more you know more off the beaten track 01:4:39,190 --> 01:4:42,559 01:4:39,200 --> 01:4:43,760 than for example you know a popular 01:4:42,549 --> 01:4:43,760 01:4:42,559 --> 01:4:46,079 productivity blog like like 01:4:43,750 --> 01:4:46,079 01:4:43,760 --> 01:4:47,680 like life hacker where i feel like now 01:4:46,069 --> 01:4:47,680 01:4:46,079 --> 01:4:48,559 i'm at the point where i should probably 01:4:47,670 --> 01:4:48,559 01:4:47,680 --> 01:4:50,880 be trying to 01:4:48,549 --> 01:4:50,880 01:4:48,559 --> 01:4:51,920 make my my make the sources that i use 01:4:50,870 --> 01:4:51,920 01:4:50,880 --> 01:4:53,440 more obscure 01:4:51,910 --> 01:4:53,440 01:4:51,920 --> 01:4:54,640 but if you're just getting started out 01:4:53,430 --> 01:4:54,640 01:4:53,440 --> 01:4:56,319 you've seen how we've literally just 01:4:54,630 --> 01:4:56,319 01:4:54,640 --> 01:4:57,520 created eight video ideas off the back 01:4:56,309 --> 01:4:57,520 01:4:56,319 --> 01:4:59,839 of browsing twitter for 01:4:57,510 --> 01:4:59,839 01:4:57,520 --> 01:5:1,440 five minutes and stealing ideas from 01:4:59,829 --> 01:5:1,440 01:4:59,839 --> 01:5:3,520 nest labs for five minutes 01:5:1,430 --> 01:5:3,520 01:5:1,440 --> 01:5:5,200 it's all very easy to do and you know 01:5:3,510 --> 01:5:5,200 01:5:3,520 --> 01:5:6,000 this thing of i don't have original 01:5:5,190 --> 01:5:6,000 01:5:5,200 --> 01:5:7,359 01:5:5,990 --> 01:5:7,359 01:5:6,000 --> 01:5:8,880 uh i don't know what to make videos 01:5:7,349 --> 01:5:8,880 01:5:7,359 --> 01:5:10,960 about i don't know what to write about 01:5:8,870 --> 01:5:10,960 01:5:8,880 --> 01:5:12,640 it holds so many people back 01:5:10,950 --> 01:5:12,640 01:5:10,960 --> 01:5:14,160 and there's no need for it because you 01:5:12,630 --> 01:5:14,160 01:5:12,640 --> 01:5:16,480 can just generate endless ideas 01:5:14,150 --> 01:5:16,480 01:5:14,160 --> 01:5:17,920 and then the lens that you give to those 01:5:16,470 --> 01:5:17,920 01:5:16,480 --> 01:5:20,079 ideas is what makes them 01:5:17,910 --> 01:5:20,079 01:5:17,920 --> 01:5:22,319 unique so those were three components of 01:5:20,069 --> 01:5:22,319 01:5:20,079 --> 01:5:24,319 the idea generation machine and 01:5:22,309 --> 01:5:24,319 01:5:22,319 --> 01:5:26,480 yeah that's that's me done thank you so 01:5:24,309 --> 01:5:26,480 01:5:24,319 --> 01:5:27,920 much i hope you enjoyed this and uh 01:5:26,470 --> 01:5:27,920 01:5:26,480 --> 01:5:30,160 thanks thanks david for having me on 01:5:27,910 --> 01:5:30,160 01:5:27,920 --> 01:5:30,880 this webinar yeah one of the things that 01:5:30,150 --> 01:5:30,880 01:5:30,160 --> 01:5:34,000 i want to 01:5:30,870 --> 01:5:34,000 01:5:30,880 --> 01:5:35,359 sort of mention is that 01:5:33,990 --> 01:5:35,359 01:5:34,000 --> 01:5:37,119 there are sort of different levels to 01:5:35,349 --> 01:5:37,119 01:5:35,359 --> 01:5:39,680 this and the amount 01:5:37,109 --> 01:5:39,680 01:5:37,119 --> 01:5:41,760 sort of the cadence of how you borrow 01:5:39,670 --> 01:5:41,760 01:5:39,680 --> 01:5:43,200 ideas i think really impacts 01:5:41,750 --> 01:5:43,200 01:5:41,760 --> 01:5:44,960 just the cadence of your life and how 01:5:43,190 --> 01:5:44,960 01:5:43,200 --> 01:5:48,640 often you want to create things 01:5:44,950 --> 01:5:48,640 01:5:44,960 --> 01:5:51,280 um i've been working on one single essay 01:5:48,630 --> 01:5:51,280 01:5:48,640 --> 01:5:53,839 for the last nine months and i've just 01:5:51,270 --> 01:5:53,839 01:5:51,280 --> 01:5:55,920 been churning through it over and over 01:5:53,829 --> 01:5:55,920 01:5:53,839 --> 01:5:57,520 and over with conversations with just 01:5:55,910 --> 01:5:57,520 01:5:55,920 --> 01:5:59,039 draft after draft 01:5:57,510 --> 01:5:59,039 01:5:57,520 --> 01:6:0,799 i'm probably on my sixth or seventh 01:5:59,029 --> 01:6:0,799 01:5:59,039 --> 01:6:2,960 draft of about a 15 to 20 01:6:0,789 --> 01:6:2,960 01:6:0,799 --> 01:6:4,000 000 word essay i actually had dinner 01:6:2,950 --> 01:6:4,000 01:6:2,960 --> 01:6:6,480 with will who 01:6:3,990 --> 01:6:6,480 01:6:4,000 --> 01:6:8,319 is one of our panelists and he this was 01:6:6,470 --> 01:6:8,319 01:6:6,480 --> 01:6:10,319 probably in november or october and he 01:6:8,309 --> 01:6:10,319 01:6:8,319 --> 01:6:12,319 was like dude the essay is awesome 01:6:10,309 --> 01:6:12,319 01:6:10,319 --> 01:6:13,440 it is now five months later i'm still 01:6:12,309 --> 01:6:13,440 01:6:12,319 --> 01:6:16,480 working on this thing 01:6:13,430 --> 01:6:16,480 01:6:13,440 --> 01:6:18,799 and i think that what ali said you know 01:6:16,470 --> 01:6:18,799 01:6:16,480 --> 01:6:20,559 is a certain kind of creativity 01:6:18,789 --> 01:6:20,559 01:6:18,799 --> 01:6:22,480 where you just want to be churning stuff 01:6:20,549 --> 01:6:22,480 01:6:20,559 --> 01:6:24,400 out all the time where it's your job 01:6:22,470 --> 01:6:24,400 01:6:22,480 --> 01:6:27,839 like this is your livelihood 01:6:24,390 --> 01:6:27,839 01:6:24,400 --> 01:6:28,319 but if you then want to sort of think 01:6:27,829 --> 01:6:28,319 01:6:27,839 --> 01:6:31,760 deeper 01:6:28,309 --> 01:6:31,760 01:6:28,319 --> 01:6:34,160 and sort of produce ideas that like 01:6:31,750 --> 01:6:34,160 01:6:31,760 --> 01:6:35,520 are more a byproduct of like your own 01:6:34,150 --> 01:6:35,520 01:6:34,160 --> 01:6:37,359 experiences 01:6:35,510 --> 01:6:37,359 01:6:35,520 --> 01:6:38,960 know that they're gonna take longer but 01:6:37,349 --> 01:6:38,960 01:6:37,359 --> 01:6:40,799 know that you can pull a lot of these 01:6:38,950 --> 01:6:40,799 01:6:38,960 --> 01:6:42,559 principles in order to do that 01:6:40,789 --> 01:6:42,559 01:6:40,799 --> 01:6:44,079 and i strongly encourage you as a 01:6:42,549 --> 01:6:44,079 01:6:42,559 --> 01:6:46,160 creator to try both 01:6:44,069 --> 01:6:46,160 01:6:44,079 --> 01:6:48,319 try on one lens you're gonna borrow from 01:6:46,150 --> 01:6:48,319 01:6:46,160 --> 01:6:50,880 a lot of other people you're gonna 01:6:48,309 --> 01:6:50,880 01:6:48,319 --> 01:6:52,880 think about okay how do i sort of cross 01:6:50,870 --> 01:6:52,880 01:6:50,880 --> 01:6:54,400 and remix like exactly what i need 01:6:52,870 --> 01:6:54,400 01:6:52,880 --> 01:6:56,960 that works really well like if you're at 01:6:54,390 --> 01:6:56,960 01:6:54,400 --> 01:6:57,839 your job and your boss comes up to you 01:6:56,950 --> 01:6:57,839 01:6:56,960 --> 01:7:0,160 and says 01:6:57,829 --> 01:7:0,160 01:6:57,839 --> 01:7:1,440 hey i need something from you in three 01:7:0,150 --> 01:7:1,440 01:7:0,160 --> 01:7:3,200 hours now 01:7:1,430 --> 01:7:3,200 01:7:1,440 --> 01:7:5,119 what ollie just did will tell you 01:7:3,190 --> 01:7:5,119 01:7:3,200 --> 01:7:6,000 exactly how to do that that's one end of 01:7:5,109 --> 01:7:6,000 01:7:5,119 --> 01:7:9,200 the spectrum 01:7:5,990 --> 01:7:9,200 01:7:6,000 --> 01:7:10,640 the other end of the spectrum is like 01:7:9,190 --> 01:7:10,640 01:7:9,200 --> 01:7:12,880 i'm trying to figure out how to save the 01:7:10,630 --> 01:7:12,880 01:7:10,640 --> 01:7:15,359 liberal arts it's a huge project 01:7:12,870 --> 01:7:15,359 01:7:12,880 --> 01:7:17,400 every single answer that has been given 01:7:15,349 --> 01:7:17,400 01:7:15,359 --> 01:7:21,200 is in my opinion 01:7:17,390 --> 01:7:21,200 01:7:17,400 --> 01:7:21,760 unsatisfactory this is a very important 01:7:21,190 --> 01:7:21,760 01:7:21,200 --> 01:7:24,640 problem 01:7:21,750 --> 01:7:24,640 01:7:21,760 --> 01:7:25,359 that is more important to me than my 01:7:24,630 --> 01:7:25,359 01:7:24,640 --> 01:7:28,000 work 01:7:25,349 --> 01:7:28,000 01:7:25,359 --> 01:7:29,440 and i can use the skills that i learned 01:7:27,990 --> 01:7:29,440 01:7:28,000 --> 01:7:31,599 from my work to 01:7:29,430 --> 01:7:31,599 01:7:29,440 --> 01:7:32,880 go out and come up with a solution and 01:7:31,589 --> 01:7:32,880 01:7:31,599 --> 01:7:35,280 because of that i've been spending 01:7:32,870 --> 01:7:35,280 01:7:32,880 --> 01:7:37,359 nine months and probably will end up 01:7:35,270 --> 01:7:37,359 01:7:35,280 --> 01:7:38,559 spending a whole year on this essay 01:7:37,349 --> 01:7:38,559 01:7:37,359 --> 01:7:40,720 just working through all the 01:7:38,549 --> 01:7:40,720 01:7:38,559 --> 01:7:42,960 nitty-gritty so 01:7:40,710 --> 01:7:42,960 01:7:40,720 --> 01:7:43,839 for those of you who feel like you know 01:7:42,950 --> 01:7:43,839 01:7:42,960 --> 01:7:45,200 what i'm not going to produce something 01:7:43,829 --> 01:7:45,200 01:7:43,839 --> 01:7:45,760 every day i don't want to work that fast 01:7:45,190 --> 01:7:45,760 01:7:45,200 --> 01:7:47,200 like 01:7:45,750 --> 01:7:47,200 01:7:45,760 --> 01:7:49,200 every single person has a different 01:7:47,190 --> 01:7:49,200 01:7:47,200 --> 01:7:49,760 cadence and each project has its 01:7:49,190 --> 01:7:49,760 01:7:49,200 --> 01:7:52,559 different 01:7:49,750 --> 01:7:52,559 01:7:49,760 --> 01:7:54,400 a different cadence and you don't want 01:7:52,549 --> 01:7:54,400 01:7:52,559 --> 01:7:56,160 the project to serve 01:7:54,390 --> 01:7:56,160 01:7:54,400 --> 01:7:58,400 the method you want the method to serve 01:7:56,150 --> 01:7:58,400 01:7:56,160 --> 01:7:59,920 the project and as you get good at both 01:7:58,390 --> 01:7:59,920 01:7:58,400 --> 01:8:2,960 sides of the spectrum 01:7:59,910 --> 01:8:2,960 01:7:59,920 --> 01:8:6,720 then you'll figure out how 01:8:2,950 --> 01:8:6,720 01:8:2,960 --> 01:8:9,280 your personality and how 01:8:6,710 --> 01:8:9,280 01:8:6,720 --> 01:8:10,319 you're basically just what you're 01:8:9,270 --> 01:8:10,319 01:8:9,280 --> 01:8:13,440 working on 01:8:10,309 --> 01:8:13,440 01:8:10,319 --> 01:8:16,960 uh how you need to adapt that to the 01:8:13,430 --> 01:8:16,960 01:8:13,440 --> 01:8:18,960 ideas that we've spoken about today 01:8:16,950 --> 01:8:18,960 01:8:16,960 --> 01:8:20,799 yeah yeah absolutely i i completely 01:8:18,950 --> 01:8:20,799 01:8:18,960 --> 01:8:23,440 agree with that like this is 01:8:20,789 --> 01:8:23,440 01:8:20,799 --> 01:8:24,480 it's it's an area where i definitely 01:8:23,430 --> 01:8:24,480 01:8:23,440 --> 01:8:26,960 want to 01:8:24,470 --> 01:8:26,960 01:8:24,480 --> 01:8:27,839 improve because i think like like like 01:8:26,950 --> 01:8:27,839 01:8:26,960 --> 01:8:29,040 for me for the last 01:8:27,829 --> 01:8:29,040 01:8:27,839 --> 01:8:31,839 kind of three and a half years it's been 01:8:29,030 --> 01:8:31,839 01:8:29,040 --> 01:8:35,120 a case of how do i 01:8:31,829 --> 01:8:35,120 01:8:31,839 --> 01:8:36,640 how do how how do i basically make easy 01:8:35,110 --> 01:8:36,640 01:8:35,120 --> 01:8:38,560 content that i can put out on youtube 01:8:36,630 --> 01:8:38,560 01:8:36,640 --> 01:8:40,080 and do it at a rate of three times per 01:8:38,550 --> 01:8:40,080 01:8:38,560 --> 01:8:40,960 week while working a full-time job as a 01:8:40,070 --> 01:8:40,960 01:8:40,080 --> 01:8:42,799 doctor 01:8:40,950 --> 01:8:42,799 01:8:40,960 --> 01:8:44,400 and my brother often picks me up on this 01:8:42,789 --> 01:8:44,400 01:8:42,799 --> 01:8:46,000 he's like dude why are you 01:8:44,390 --> 01:8:46,000 01:8:44,400 --> 01:8:48,000 just parroting the same stuff that 01:8:45,990 --> 01:8:48,000 01:8:46,000 --> 01:8:51,520 everyone else is parroting and i'm like 01:8:47,990 --> 01:8:51,520 01:8:48,000 --> 01:8:53,600 because it works and that is my goal 01:8:51,510 --> 01:8:53,600 01:8:51,520 --> 01:8:54,640 in in the short term but now as i'm 01:8:53,590 --> 01:8:54,640 01:8:53,600 --> 01:8:56,719 writing this book about meaningful 01:8:54,630 --> 01:8:56,719 01:8:54,640 --> 01:8:58,400 productivity and i want to become 01:8:56,709 --> 01:8:58,400 01:8:56,719 --> 01:9:0,080 my i want to have my own original 01:8:58,390 --> 01:9:0,080 01:8:58,400 --> 01:9:1,920 insights and and that kind of stuff 01:9:0,070 --> 01:9:1,920 01:9:0,080 --> 01:9:3,520 i'm now shifting gears a little bit and 01:9:1,910 --> 01:9:3,520 01:9:1,920 --> 01:9:6,000 moving away from 01:9:3,510 --> 01:9:6,000 01:9:3,520 --> 01:9:6,880 the let me rip off a random idea from a 01:9:5,990 --> 01:9:6,880 01:9:6,000 --> 01:9:8,880 blog and just 01:9:6,870 --> 01:9:8,880 01:9:6,880 --> 01:9:10,159 present it as my own and more towards 01:9:8,870 --> 01:9:10,159 01:9:8,880 --> 01:9:11,600 the okay let's actually go back to the 01:9:10,149 --> 01:9:11,600 01:9:10,159 --> 01:9:12,960 original sources let's 01:9:11,590 --> 01:9:12,960 01:9:11,600 --> 01:9:14,080 dive dive deep into the studies that 01:9:12,950 --> 01:9:14,080 01:9:12,960 --> 01:9:14,719 have been done around this that no one's 01:9:14,070 --> 01:9:14,719 01:9:14,080 --> 01:9:16,000 looking at 01:9:14,709 --> 01:9:16,000 01:9:14,719 --> 01:9:17,679 and let's try and find some original 01:9:15,990 --> 01:9:17,679 01:9:16,000 --> 01:9:19,920 insight so i think there is absolutely 01:9:17,669 --> 01:9:19,920 01:9:17,679 --> 01:9:22,080 that that balance to be had between 01:9:19,910 --> 01:9:22,080 01:9:19,920 --> 01:9:24,159 publishing frequency like a machine and 01:9:22,070 --> 01:9:24,159 01:9:22,080 --> 01:9:25,679 generating and generating original ideas 01:9:24,149 --> 01:9:25,679 01:9:24,159 --> 01:9:26,480 i think yeah somewhere somewhere in the 01:9:25,669 --> 01:9:26,480 01:9:25,679 --> 01:9:29,279 middle is is 01:9:26,470 --> 01:9:29,279 01:9:26,480 --> 01:9:29,759 ideal yeah you know like and we can move 01:9:29,269 --> 01:9:29,759 01:9:29,279 --> 01:9:31,279 into q 01:9:29,749 --> 01:9:31,279 01:9:29,759 --> 01:9:33,359 a after this so we can just do a couple 01:9:31,269 --> 01:9:33,359 01:9:31,279 --> 01:9:34,799 questions but you know a lot of people 01:9:33,349 --> 01:9:34,799 01:9:33,359 --> 01:9:36,480 look at for example i was very 01:9:34,789 --> 01:9:36,480 01:9:34,799 --> 01:9:39,199 influenced by a guy named marsh mcluhan 01:9:36,470 --> 01:9:39,199 01:9:36,480 --> 01:9:41,199 marsh mclaren wrote the 1960s and what i 01:9:39,189 --> 01:9:41,199 01:9:39,199 --> 01:9:43,600 do when i discover 01:9:41,189 --> 01:9:43,600 01:9:41,199 --> 01:9:44,719 somebody who's writing i really admire 01:9:43,590 --> 01:9:44,719 01:9:43,600 --> 01:9:47,759 is i pick up 01:9:44,709 --> 01:9:47,759 01:9:44,719 --> 01:9:49,759 the books that have influenced them and 01:9:47,749 --> 01:9:49,759 01:9:47,759 --> 01:9:51,199 what i realized is often these things 01:9:49,749 --> 01:9:51,199 01:9:49,759 --> 01:9:53,440 just also happen on different time 01:9:51,189 --> 01:9:53,440 01:9:51,199 --> 01:9:56,960 scales marsh mcluhan in his books he has 01:9:53,430 --> 01:9:56,960 01:9:53,440 --> 01:9:58,640 hundreds of citations and he is building 01:9:56,950 --> 01:9:58,640 01:9:56,960 --> 01:10:0,480 upon different books that he's read i 01:9:58,630 --> 01:10:0,480 01:9:58,640 --> 01:10:2,520 once counted the number of citations in anti-fragile benzene to lab it's about 550 citations but then you know when you go and you actually read people's influences in some way they lose some of their magic and you know i think that what ollie and i are trying to say here is yes there is an element of creativity like if you take the word genius right you know what the etymology the word genius is it's genie and this goes back to the roman times where people literally thought that a genie would fly into the creator's studio and would basically endow them with creative ideas as like a gift and that genie would then contribute to their genius and you have that on one side which is just this sort of effervescent magical genius and there's an element of that but there's the other element of genius of like ollie and i do this and there are certain things that you can do to make your life as a creator much easier and go back i encourage you find your favorite people and study them find your wes anderson to the kcna stat in my case i went and with march mcluhan i'm now reading all of lewis mumford's to say okay how did mcluhan actually build up to these ideas and same thing with naseem's lab i went back and studied uh benoit mandelbrot and i said wow these are just taking these ideas translating them and adapting them to a new age that is how a lot of non-fiction creativity is will all right guys first question uh when you're coming up with all these different ideas uh any tips for prioritizing your ideas and deciding which videos or essays to work on first um you know there's this concept of idea overload or indecision about where to start so we'd love to hear y'all's thoughts on that mine is uh very unsatisfactory i just pick what i'm most excited about in the moment i think if i'm excited about it i look through my ideas i'm like you know what it would be really fun to do a video journaling today i mean let me let me do that one uh nothing particularly fancy to it the same way i write about what i'm excited about and i get hyped about ideas but i just gotta execute on them right away perfect next question in addition to a lack of consistency and a lack of persistence what are other biggest mistakes that aspiring creators writers youtubers tend to make on the youtuber front not thinking and not thinking enough about titles and thumbnails literally the most important we all hate paying attention to it especially if you're an intellectual and you're like oh i don't want to have to think about titles and thumbnails it's all click bait anyway and oh i don't want to have to use caps in my titles because that's clickbait and cringe i used to be like that for about two years before i realized oh my god if you don't get that if you don't get the click they don't get a chance to see how amazingly well-crafted your video is so title and thumbnail all the way from me yeah i laughed really hard in ollie's presentation when he talked about the cringeness of all caps i just i i was cracking up and you know every every artist every creator you serve two mediums you serve or you serve two masters you serve the medium and you serve the work and when you serve the medium you say what is what does this medium need for me how do i need to optimize my work and you have to know that when you're a creator then there's the other side and there's the art and there is what the art wants and every time you do something especially if you do this for a job you do this because you want something you got to think about where on this spectrum do i want to fall and some artists they're uncompromising in their commitment to the art but it can be hard to make a living if you do that other artists are uncompromising in their commitment to the medium and they're not artists they're just hyper optimized automatons who are just mostly uninteresting and so as creators we have to grapple with this spectrum and once you make that trade-off conscious then you can think clearly about where on the spectrum you want to be so we had a question in the chat uh somebody just sort of stream of consciousness said something like gosh so you're turning out all out all this content but is there any meaning behind it all are you just making content for the sake of it just to get more followers and can you guys talk about what you see is the the purpose behind the song and what do you guys see as uh maybe a higher sense of mission or how do you see that question um from happening i mean i'll speak to this i mean look there's there's there's a couple things the like there is first of all just the ability like i want to be the best essayist in the entire world and that is my goal i want to get to a place where i spend decades and my essays are just absolutely exceptional and for me it's all about the long form essay that to me is a beautiful craft and i want to get good at that long form essay in video and i want to get good at that long form i say in writing and i want to be absolutely exceptional at it so that's my end goal and that to me is a very noble mission it's exciting and it psychs me up i love that but in order to get there there are things that i need to do i need to be able to fund my life so that and in order to do that i have a business i have people who work for me who i need to support i have health care to pay and stuff like that that's the first the second thing is i need the time and the space and the energy to do this work that is extremely important to me and so what i do is i've built a life where i say how do i work really hard five months out of the year so i have seven months out of the year that i can write these truly outstanding essays and get to a place that over years and over decades i can hone this craft so that i can make myself proud and i can admire my own work and that goal to me makes life worth living it's just a beautiful challenge that i've signed up for each and every day so it's really interesting that you say that's because i feel like uh i don't have any kind of uh long-term any any any goal like that my thing is more that i like i think the thing that that gives me the most meaning is teaching others and what i've what i've found is you know in the in the way that i make videos it is you know something like i'm going to film a video tomorrow doing you know explaining doing a summary of the four hour work week in in my mind i i would be tempted to say this is meaningless content because it's been summarized before it's been out since 2007. uh lots of people in the chat who are familiar with the book be like oh god uh you're just adding to the my asthma of content around the four-hour work week and hustle lifestyle and blah blah but that video is going to get 200 000 maybe more than that and for a large percentage of that audience it will be the first time they're hearing of the four-hour workweek it'll be the first time they're hearing of tim ferriss and this is genuinely the book that's most changed my life out of anything that i've ever read and if even like a handful of people if even one person can have the the response to this book that i did it just completely transforms the the trajectory of your life as it did for me and so it reminds me of uh something that derek siva says which is what's obvious to you can be amazing to others and i used to not really buy into this but now the more i've made videos and seen comments on things where i'm like in in my mind i feel oh god this was just a throwaway video i made purely to churn the content machine but it's resonated with loads of people and i'm like damn maybe i'm not the best judge of what is what's content worth making and so i try to think about the fact that there are going to be people that have never come across this stuff before even if i internally feel that ah this is kind of cheating yeah and i mean i think that when it comes to ali like i think it's important for all of us to say what what do we have that the world needs from us and i mean when i look at my studio the lights i have a big light here i have a microphone here i have a camera here i got a lens i have another light here i have a whole system for youtube that i've built and this was very simple for ali but i went through his course part-time youtuber academy and every single thing that i'm looking at in here every single video that i create is because of my time and a student of the course and so the things that you make which can be obvious to you but if you know that other people are interested in those ideas they can be transformative for other people and it's because of ali that i'm able to do youtube at such a high level all right guys last question i like the wording on this one how do you manage your inner saboteur when you lose confidence in your idea before you even get anywhere and specifically i want you guys to talk about when you're starting out david when you're making those early youtube videos or writing your first essays without an audience ali when it was june 2017 and you had that flat line on the graph how did you manage your inner saboteur especially at the beginning so my technique my tactic for this was was was was kind of twofold one was that and i i said this in my very first vlog that look even if no one watches this at the very least it will be a good memory for me to look back on and my grandma who's in pakistan will appreciate seeing my face on video and seeing what's up with my life and so i just lowered the stakes so much i was like you know what worst case scenario i get a bunch of memories and it's it's nice to look back on and the second thing was um that the main thing i was thinking was i'm i'm i'm going to document i'm not going to create and this is something that gary vaynerchuk talks about a lot i think for me the thought of creating felt very like oh you have to create something and that's hard because you've got to be original and good and stuff whereas documenting which is like hey hey guys here is how i take notes on my ipad hey guys here is how i manage my to-do list hey guys here is what i thought about this book by tim ferriss even to this day you know it's i silence the inner saboteur by thinking you know what i'm just documenting my vibe is this this kind of works for me maybe you'll like it if it works for you go and try it see what happens i'm not trying to be a guru not trying to be an expert in anything um there's actually a phrase that my writing coach recently said which is that you want to be a guide rather than a guru a guide is someone who's on the same journey as as as the audience and maybe is you know maybe one step ahead maybe just walking alongside a guru is someone who comes down from the mountain with all the answers and it's really hard to be a guru but it's very easy to be a guide and so those are the things that i use to silence the inner saboteur my answer is a little different i mean when i when i started writing um i actually just followed what i did when i started working out where working out was really hard for me i grew up pretty skinny and i had it very much in my identity that i was gonna be skinny that i wasn't gonna have a lot of muscle and that really bothered me for a lot of years and when i was in college people used to make fun of me when i was in high school when i was growing up i was just bullied really bad and it sucked like it really sucked and i had to get out of that and when i was in college i had a friend his name was jamie and jamie was a year older than me and he pulled me to the gym and he said something that really stuck with me he said it doesn't matter how hard you go when you do it what matters is that you do it every day and so what i did was i went to the gym every single day and i actually set a 30 minute time limit where after 30 minutes i had to leave and so rather than going and trying to just become ripped in one session i said none of my sessions are actually going to be that impactful but i'm going to make sure that i never miss a day monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday i went to the gym no matter what and i never missed a day and all that mattered was that i walked into the gym then i got the check box and i'm not like ripped now but i don't struggle with a lot of the issues that i used to have i don't have the self-image issues that i grew up with and i'm really proud of that and when i started writing something very similar happened which was i wanted to be the equivalent of ripped and i didn't know how to get there and so what i said was rather than trying to write the next great american novel in one day i'm gonna sit down and i'm gonna show up every single day and i write every day there's not a day that i miss this is a craft it is a way of life and i am dedicated to this like any ordinary professional would be and when you make a commitment to creative work you show up no matter how you feel and you do your on the behalf of ali and myself thank you very much for joining us today it is a real honor to be able to share this time with you thanks guys it's been a lot of fun bye everybody see you later
