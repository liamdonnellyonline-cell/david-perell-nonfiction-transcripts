what do you think that you've learned in say the six years since you've started quillette about publishing a high volume of articles that you wish you had known when you started that's an interesting question there there hasn't been a whole lot that's changed since we started um we i would i've learned from jamie my co my colleague that um avoiding polemic articles avoiding uh articles that are overly emotional and are trying to get an audience angry or get a hot response avoiding those type of articles is actually a good thing long term because you develop a more moderate reasonable audience and writers respect that and you and you just develop this sort of civilized culture and and my colleague jamie has done a lot to foster this sort of moderation that we've become known for i really like that why do you think that that seems like such a challenging thing for the media industry to do to put it likely well obviously a lot of media has been chasing revenue through the advertising model and so to do that one it's really easy to publish material that gets a hot response from readers it makes them angry or disgusted or enraged and that and material like that can get a lot of page views very quickly but it upsets people makes people angry and i think it's damaging to a brand over the long term so the short term strategy of chasing clicks and page views is ultimately damaging to the trust that readers have in in a brand and so with the help of my colleagues we have sort of adopted a strategy where we don't chase clicks we don't chase that short-term revenue or that even that short-term notoriety and we publish mod reasonable moderate material that is analytical that appeals to people who have cooler heads rather than hot heads and and a lot of the content we publish is also evergreen so we get a lot of traffic from older articles that we've published a couple of years ago it's still relevant today so although we don't chase clicks in the short term we still get a high volume of traffic because so much of the material we publish is not just relevant to this week it's relevant to um you know the last five years or the last 10 years and so on so we've just adopted a different strategy that is more long-term focused i think yeah that actually thank you for that because it made preparing for this podcast really fun because i could just go and i could scroll to your first articles and i read all those the early stuff on feminism and then i was going through 2016 2017 and there was another thing that you did where you don't compare to other publications really focus on american politics and you much more focus on these meta points which which i really liked and i also like what you said there i i've never quite thought of this idea of like the time horizon of clicks people think of chasing clicks as like 48 hours 72 hours but really there's a kind of click chasing that you could do over a 10 year period that leads you to a very different calculus in terms of the articles that you publish that's right that's exactly right and in publishing evergreen content which i mean that's a it's a vague term but for example we've published articles on uh famous writers and you know there's always going to be fans of flannery o'connor or jd salinger who are googling their fa their favorite writer you know and you always find these really interesting essays about these historical figures and that kind of writing doesn't go out of fashion it's always interesting to the reader those there and we have a lot of essays that are standalone essays that we think will stand the test of time you could read them 10 years from now from now and they'll still bring something to you and so that kind of material although it might not go viral in the moment over over a long time period can generate a lot of traffic and a lot of re attract a lot of readers and um yeah it's quite valuable to invest in
