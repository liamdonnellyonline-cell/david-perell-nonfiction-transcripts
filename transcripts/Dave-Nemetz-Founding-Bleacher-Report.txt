so i grew up big sports fan grew up in the san francisco bay area and my whole engagement with with sports was my dad used to come down every single morning and he'd give me the the sports section and he it was from the san francisco chronicle the san jose mercury news and the new york times and i'd read three sports sections every morning but now the way i engage with sports is so different there's i'm engaging with players a lot more than i'm engaging with teams i care less about the standings than i do and any individual game and i care a lot more about the highlights and the storylines and the cultural aspect of sports has really taken off and if i look at the last 15 years of how sports has changed that's how i'd summarize what's happened yeah yeah and yeah i had a very similar experience i read the i grew up in the bay area as well i read the mercury news sports section pretty much every day from probably when i was around 12 years old until i was out of high school uh and that was my experience and then you know kind of watching you know sportscenter on espn during its classic days and you'd get the highlights from all over um and that you know that was kind of the the the first part where you you you started to see you know kind of this infusion of personality and story lines and humor and jokes into sports uh and then you know i think you know around the time we started bleacher report it started to explode uh on the internet and you know we we really you know kind of saw this you know kind of this this opportunity to bring that fans point of view uh and uh yeah to kind of give that uh that big focus on the culture of sports as opposed to just the you know the headlines the box scores the quick highlights and you know turn it into this this kind of round-the-clock thing and yeah i think it's you know it's it's gone so much further today uh you know where you know it's it's kind of you know your experience growing up as a sports fan is is very different you are much more connected to players and to kind of specific storylines and uh you know to this cultural aspect than you are necessarily to you know just kind of this very like you know regional you know kind of local aspect why didn't that happen sooner so cnn started sometime in the early 90s and that's when they the news had that around the clock flavor that you were just alluding to why didn't this happen sooner what happened with bleacher report and bar stool starting when they did why was the world only ready for this at that time because it seems like there must have been some kind of latent appetite for this for years but maybe the technology wasn't there yet maybe the players weren't there yet maybe the world of media wasn't there yet why did these companies start when they did you know i think i think a lot of it had to do with with the internet and with you know kind of you know companies coming at it from a digital first perspective and that yeah that's one of the things that that we saw early on at bleacher when you know or very early on you know like i i said before we it was a passion project we didn't even consider it a you know a true company for a while it was just something we were yeah we we were creating because we wanted to see it uh but then you know after being in it for a couple years we started to realize you know we were competing with espn we were competing with fox sports and cbs sports uh and you know the the advantage we had against a lot of them is all we cared about was digital all we cared about was building an audience on the internet whereas they all saw that as secondary to what they had on you know in tv and these big broadcast operations um and it was really about you know i mean there was a while where you know you went to the fox sports website and all it did was tell you like what time the next game was on that they were going to broadcast it was so focused on you know kind of pushing people to that you know that big broadcast tv experience which drives a ton of revenue for for all these companies and you know they've invested a ton of revenue in it so you can understand that but you know they were really kind of missing the boat on digital and the way that we were able to build such a big audience and you know kind of out of nowhere you know create something that could compete with them is all we were doing was thinking about you know feeding this conversation digitally and you know kind of encouraging that back and forth with an audience which you can't really do on tv um so so that was you know that was what really kind of you know drove that and you know you look at what barstool has done today or what the athletic uh you know is doing you know they're they're just you know they're kind of feeding that beast in a very different way so you've told me that you think of media businesses almost like a supply and demand equation and so what are you looking for like you know one of my fundamental sort of ideas is that there's certain moments in life where you really want to believe in efficient markets and certain moments in life where it's actually really bad to believe in efficient markets for example one of the ways in which it's really bad is you talk to new creators who want to start creating online and they're like oh all the ideas that i've shared they've already been shared before and so when i talk to my writing students it's the efficient market hypothesis that idea and they might not even be be explicitly aware of it but implicitly that's how they feel but then on the other side what you're sort of looking for is you're operating with an assumption that the markets for media isn't always entirely efficient and so what you're looking for is where there's demand pulling on an idea but there's no supply to give people what they want talk about that yeah yeah i mean i think that's that's exactly the point i mean everyone you know hears these things about how you know there's more information new information created in you know whatever uh you know a day now than there were in you know centuries before right and you know we just got this flood of content from from all sides and it's you know be impossible to keep up but you know i think the other thing that's that's happened is you know we've all been able to you know through the internet through this explosion of content and media you know it it allows people to seek out and find things that speak exactly to them and so you know while the supply has increased dramatically the demand has increased and you know kind of how broad that demand is you know you everyone has the opportunity to find the community you know the content creator that that speaks directly to them uh and and so i think you know when you think about creating a media business whether it's you know a big scale business or whether it's a a one-person media business like like the trend is today uh you know i think you know that kind of thinking about it in that supply-demand way you know where where is their demand you know for you know for content that's not being fulfilled that you are uniquely positioned to fill that demand and i i think that's the key and and you know we that that was that was kind of the the big aha moment at bleacher report early on where you know we were looking at you know like i said competing with the espns and the fox sports of the world and we you know we realized that they just weren't covering those story those like cultural story lines they weren't covering teams at a deep level and you know we were we were building this community of writers uh and and this this voice that you know was was uniquely positioned to fulfill that demand and we started to look at it on a real granular level um you know one of the one of the areas that you know we yeah we noticed early on just wasn't wasn't getting the types of coverage uh you know at the level uh that um you know there was there was real demand for was around the nfl draft and around you know kind of all of the you know it's all the hype and the you know the you know kind of analyzing the different prospects and looking at you know kind of the the you know the team's uh you know needs and all that like there was a big you know kind of peak you know coverage around that like right before the draft and you know we realized early on and this was you know both in the numbers and also you know kind of based on you know our own personal experience that that's something that fans wanted year round they want like you know they they wanted they were thinking about constantly like how is my team going to improve and so you know we started to turn that into a year-round coverage beat um and you know a lot of a lot of the other sports site followed suit eventually uh but that's that's one part yeah one point where we we really had an advantage early on and you know we we kind of followed that supply demand curve and you know i think you know you can you can think about it that you know if you're starting a media business if you're you know starting a personal blog a podcast whatever sure there's a ton of stuff out there um but you know where you know where do you see you know where do you see interest where do you see people galvanizing around something that that you're uniquely positioned to fulfill it and you know there's there's always going to be an opportunity to build an audience around that how would you think about that on implicit on one side with explicit on the other in terms of gauging supply and demand so implicit is me and my buddies from college love sports but there's a aspect of sports that we're not getting we know we want this so i'm gonna go build it that's the implicit side the explicit side is seo you're looking at keyword volume and keyword competition and you're looking for places where the number of people searching is way higher than the number of people actually writing about that thing and you're going on that how would you think about the trade-off between those two if you were advising a company yeah so i mean i think you know you always have to start with that kind of that that implicit idea in that vision around hey here's something that you know yeah that you you just have a strong deep-seated belief that there's there's a need for in the world because you as a consumer have looked for it and haven't been able to found it find it because you have a specific insight around some topic or some category that you know you you don't think people are you know covering it in in the way it should be or you know it's it's not being talked about enough um and you know it always has to kind of start from that you know that inner vision um but you know i think about when you're building a media company when you're building an audience you know first of all it just starts with putting things out there you know kind of showing up and you're kind of putting putting your ideas out there consistently and kind of brick by brick building building an audience and and and creating a body of work and then over time you know people are just going to find you and you know kind of the beauty of the internet is people have a way of just finding the things whether through seo through sharing through word of mouth finding the things that speak to them uh but you know you start to see patterns in what's working and what people are responding to uh and you you know you can start to look at every piece of content you put out there as a data point and you know you it's sometimes it's hard to see the force for the trees when you've got you know there can be rand you know randomness and you know one thing hits and another thing doesn't and you you might feel like your best work isn't getting you know getting the most hits or whatever and like you can't read too deeply into that but you can start to understand you know these are the things that really resonate with my audience these are the you know these are the the story frames that you know that that people you know really seem to love and respond to and yeah like search is a great you know gauge of that because it's you know search is a market you know people are looking for things they they don't know where to find it they go to google and they type in you know whatever you know buffalo pills news or you know what yeah what when's the next star wars movie coming out or you know whatever it is and you know if you have you know kind of you know if you if you're you know providing you know the right content for the right search you know then then you know you're on to something if that starts to happen repeatedly you know then that could start to kind of point the way for you you have been to more than 200 fish concerts what has fish taught you about building a brand and building a fan base that is engaged as any band i've ever seen you know fish uh i love the music obviously uh you know i wouldn't have gone to so many shows if i didn't uh but i think there's you know there's a really interesting lesson to learn and how they've created this community and this super engaged fan base that that goes beyond you know the the music and the long meandering jams and all the things you you hear about fish uh and you know it it comes back to this concept about world building uh which is which is something that's really prominent in like you know sci-fi and fantasy and you think about you know star wars and you know kind of this intricate world that they've built uh but you know it's really a concept can apply to a lot of different areas music being one of them you have seen it with you know it's something that's that's that's rising a lot now with other types of media companies and it kind of it essentially means you know you create this this immersive world and experience around your brand you've got you where you know kind of the people who are following it you know feel like you know they're kind of insiders where there's only things that only they know there's there's a secret language there's you know kind of specific customs that you kind of have to be on the inside uh to really get it uh and and you know fish got this very early on you know they you know even even back in the earliest days when they were you know kind of playing bars around vermont you know they were you know kind of weaving these little like inside jokes and stories into their songs where there might be you know you know 15 people at the show but it's oh you know you had to be at that show to like really get that reference and then they're gonna you know kind of refer back to it maybe at you know the next show a week later um and you know they have a they've created a secret musical language where you know you you had to know if they played a certain you know a certain melody everyone in the audience does something um and you know there's there's so much more beyond it i mean they you know the the um the format they have for their shows they play a different concert every night so they play a different set list different songs some are you know some songs they play all the time some they might go 10 years without playing and that has created this uh you know interesting obsession with stats amongst fish fans it's all almost like like baseball stats where you know people keep track of not just the shows that they've gone to but how many times they've seen a certain song you know when when the last time they saw the song was you know if there was you know kind of an interesting unique way it was played uh so you know and that that becomes it's almost like a video game it's almost like you're you know you're kind of collecting experience points and you know a a certain unique song is like a badge of honor you know amongst the fans and i think there's something that that you can you can learn from that if you're creating a media business or really kind of any consumer business is you know kind of find ways to really give those like those deeper experiences to your most loyal fans and you have to kind of give them you know something special that they can you know feel even more connected you know to you and to your brand to connect with each other um and that's that's how you really build loyalty that you know people just you know kind of want to go go to bat for your brand or or really want to you know kind of feel like they're they're on the inside that they're part of the world yeah it's a phenomenal answer and just there's a lot here so how would you think about the trade-off between like if i go to my first fish concert is the experience worse for me than it would be for a normal artist because i don't understand those things or are they sort of layering them sort of deeper so that it's still okay for the first time fan because that is something that it seems like there'd be a trade-off between what you're giving your die-hard fans and they almost like the fact that it's bad for new people that the new people don't know the language but what you're doing is you're creating this culture so as a media business it seems like that would even map very well onto your business model like maybe an advertising based business model at least most of them would be very good for first timers seo like somebody comes and you make money off of the page view and then they leave whereas like a athletic subscription might be very different or like a ben thompson right the way that ben thompson is self-referentially talks about aggregation theory and all these ideas that i'm wondering like how this maps onto business models i guess yeah yeah i mean to to answer the first part of your question i think you know you can you can go to a fish concert for example not know any of the references not know any of the songs and maybe see people you know you don't know to you know that you're supposed to clap at a certain part of when they play stash and you see everyone people around you around you doing it and you know you could kind of start to clue into it a little bit i i feel like you know for for the newer fan that's one of the cooler things where you just see how into it people are um and you know it can vary i've i've taken you know people who are new to the band to shows where they play a bunch of very you know kind deep bust out songs that you know the hardcore fans love but are not very accessible to the new fan and they're kind of like what what the hell am i seeing but you know you can still kind of just just vibe off the connection between the band and the audience and how deep that is and you know if you're in the right mindset and you're you know kind of receptive to it i feel that that you know that's how they create the new fans and of course like any brand or like any music it's not for everyone uh and yeah i think about that the way you know when i think about that how that applies to a media business certainly for you know subscription you know kind of if you're you know really you know speaking to a very narrow audience uh you know people who've already sought you out who are either considering paying or willing to pay you know that i think there's a similar dynamic at play but you know even in in an ad supported world you know i look at um some of the things that for example uh the guys at the morning brew are are doing with with their business center uh alex and austin on the show and and i'm a big fan of them as well i mean they're i think they i look at what they're doing they're very intentional about you know kind of the the voice of their brand you know kind of the you know the jokes that they use in their headlines even down to like the iconography that you know the people who work there you know use on on their twitter handles and you know they're they're creating a world around their audience where you're around their brand where you know you you kind of you might sign up you might start to see their stuff and you you kind of start to feel like hey this is you know this is a very intentional space of creating a voice of kind of how you know how they're approaching telling stories and there's a lot of links and nods to their audience uh and yeah i think that's that's that's you know the kind of the same sense of how you build loyalty where you know even though it's a media brand speaking to millions of people you kind of feel like it's sticking directly to you and like you're on the inside um and i think in a very different way you know barstool has done that with their audience and to massive success and to the outside i mean a lot of people look at parcel and i i did for a while and say like you know what is this it's you know it's crass it's like you know it's you know it gets offensive it's you know there's just a lot of stuff that like you know you you can if you're looking at in a certain way it's hard to wrap your head around and like you know fair enough but they have created this voice created this world you know these characters where you've got everyone from portnoy on down has like a personality where they're playing a character almost like professional wrestling and people get into it and it's they feel like they're on the inside and i think that's the kind of definition it's from the outside looking in you say well yeah it's hard to make heads or tails of it but if you're on the inside you get it right and you know there's something special when that happens so i was listening to green day a couple months ago with a friend and i have this theory about green day that you can tell if someone is a fan of green day versus just heard the popular songs by whether they know the song jesus of suburbia and i'll tell you why because american idiot came out in 2004 the track list was american idiot jesus of suburbia boulevard of broken dreams then holiday an american idiot boulevard of broken dreams and holiday were three hit songs and they were all radio songs but on the album jesus of suburbia was right there so if you were a fan you everyone would know that song but then there were a lot of people who you know pose your green day fans and whatever they wouldn't know it and uh the theory is always held true and so i think that there's like these little signals that you get in any kind of brand which i agree make these brands really special real quick question for you what is the craziest farthest story that or place where you've gone to a fish concert so um actually not not too far from where i am now i'm i'm currently uh on the coast of maine uh near belfast uh and uh the the farthest i've gone for was just over in vermont uh northern vermont uh coventry was the farewell uh festival that fish put on when the band broke up uh for the first time uh back in 2004 uh and so this was you know this was a huge deal they you know they put an announcement at the time it was going to be their final shows ever um and you know if you know kind of army of fans showed up you know a few miles from the the canada border uh to see them play um yeah we uh i drove up there with a friend uh a few hours outside of it his car broke down we hitchhiked uh you know found some some benevolent fans who uh who picked us up and we hitchhiked the rest of the way there uh and then as we were waiting along the highway in an all-night traffic jam to get in they came on and announced that because of massive rains that had been you know kind of saturated in the area for the few days beforehand it was too muddy to get people onto the festival that they were going to have to basically start turning cars away and people weren't going to be able to um so we already didn't have a car so we just got out grabbed our stuff and we hiked in along with thousands of other fans miles from from the highway into the you know into the festival grounds uh and and saw the show i mean the show was itself was a blur but that whole experience of getting there i mean you talk about the dedication of fans you know that's uh that's about as as dedicated as you can get and fortunately they weren't really the farewell shows they came back five years later and you know they're they're still well they've been going strong until you know covet times and you know hopefully they'll be back you know whenever this is all over yeah let's talk about the arrival fallacy so you sold your you sold bleacher report to turner and let's talk about the time that you spent vegas after that and then we'll work back towards what it's like to do a huge m a deal like that yeah um so yeah that was um i guess a little over uh eight years ago um august 2012 we sold the company uh to turner um yeah which is it's it's crazy it's been that long but uh you know it was uh yeah kind of the the culmination of you know kind of nearly you know seven years of working on uh bleacher report at the time basically since we you know got out of college and started working on this uh you know this project um so i mean you know it was just a you know kind of a crazy time with a lot of you know honestly mixed emotions you think about the you know the all the highs of selling the company and you know kind of getting getting you know kind of to that point and you know i think there's a lot that you know that happens when you you know when you get to something that you've anticipated for so long where it's never exactly what you think it was uh what you think what you thought it would be um so yeah you asked about vegas um you know we um you know a few weeks after selling the company uh you know we took the entire company to las vegas which was pretty pretty nuts we chartered a whole southwest plain from san francisco uh to las vegas had kind of the other offices meet us there um and you know it was you know pretty much kind of what you would expect of like just a huge blowout you know let's you know kind of go live the high life you know there were you know people yeah and all night at the tables and the clubs and all that stuff and um you know i you know had a great time uh but yeah i i wrote about this recently uh and you know i was so burned out after just what we had been through uh and the acquisition process that you know it was yeah i was i was i kind of felt like i was just like going through the motions you know i was like showing up to you know to to you know kind of celebrate with everyone uh but you know in my in my head i was i was totally mentally checked out at that point and you know there's there's a lot of things that i think people you know don't really talk about about you know kind of what it's like to go through that process of selling a company um and just you know working working so hard at something and then finally getting to that point um you know it can it can really you you know it can it can mess you up in a way you know a little bit you know in terms of like your your your mindset your mental health and um you know the arrival fallacy uh you know is a concept that uh that that really tries to uh you know kind of describe that um which is that you know you kind of you you when you're working towards a goal when you're you know kind of you know a very driven type person and all you think about is you know how you can kind of get to the next milestone and achieving things like yeah that's something that can consume you and you know often you know in a good way you're you know you know you're always focused on how you make that next you know kind of step forward and you know within that there's a reward cycle where you know every you know kind of uh every achievement you know gives you a little you know a little hit and you're you know you're kind of working towards and then you work towards that next one and then ultimately you know when you finally get to that big goal that you've been working towards all of a sudden you have nothing kind of driving you forward you know and you know i think there's there's a little bit of you know of course you know overall you know i the bleach report experience was phenomenal and you know i you know very fortunate and and privileged to have gone through it and and you know achieved the exit and the the success that that we did um but you know i think there's you know there there can be a lot of problems with tying up your identity and your self-worth to a company a project you know a yeah kind of a goal that you're you're shooting towards when you know kind of you get there and you realize hey you know just because you achieved something doesn't solve all your problems doesn't mean you know you're automatically a different person um and you know that that can that can lead to kind of some bittersweet feelings as well um so yeah that's that's you know that was kind of my experience it took me a while you know after bleach report to really like you know get into a good mental head space and and you know work on my my mental health to the point where i you know kind of had you know felt like i i had other things driving me you know beyond you know what i really spent the last seven years working on do you ever wonder if the in ability or unwillingness to question your motivations actually push people hard enough and give people the drive and the i'm not even gonna think about it attitude that then leads to that burnout but ultimately is might be what you actually need to build a company like bleacher report yeah i mean i think it's you know it's a double-edged sword you know there's being being a part of you know a company that or you know project that's just on a mission where you feel like you know you're not gonna let anything stop you um and you've yeah you've got you know i had a great group of co-founders and yeah we had a yeah just a really tight-knit early team that was kind of there the whole way and you know there's there's a certain a bit of momentum and inevitability that you know you kind of you can push through the ups and downs and you know you're kind of so caught up on it it's like riding a wave um that no question you know that you know that ultimately is you know a huge part of you know achieving success is kind of having that um but you know it can get consuming and it can you know kind of uh you know play some some negative effects on you um and you know kind of i've you know when i was when i was doing bleacher i was in my 20s and i was you know kind of go fast you know you know you know kind of just you know be you know uber focus on it all the time you never turn it off um and you know i've i've yeah kind of really learned to take a step back um and i've gotten you know really you know learned to appreciate uh you kind of the uh you know the need to have balance in your life and to to uh you know take take your mindset seriously um and that's something you know as you know kind of by you know after bleacher you kind of went on and started inverse and built that and sold it last year you know kind of having that balance having you know kind of a really commitment to mindset and mindfulness you know kind of helped me through that experience um through a lot of ups and downs there as well i think in a much more even keeled way um than you know what i experienced at bleacher report so um you know i think you know there's there's been culturally i think more appreciation for mindfulness and work-life balance obviously there's still a huge hustle porn culture out there as well um you know to each their own uh but uh you know certainly like i you know i see the the benefit of you know you could still have that project and that you know kind of that inner drive and that push to you continue to you know climb the mountain and achieve more and more but you know ultimately i think also kind of having that balance and that that commitment to you know kind of a mindset that that helps you get through it um is is the right way to go so you're talking about two m a deals that you've done bleacher and inverse having never done one myself what would surprise me the most about doing an m a deal outside of the mental health component outside of the emotional component just about the tactical business components of what you actually do what would surprise me the most um i mean unfortunately the you know the one of the surprises just how grueling they are and how you know i think you know certainly i can't speak for every deal and every process but our experience at uh at bleacher you know it was a nine month eight nine month process yeah from start to finish uh uh of selling the company and that was you know we were not trying to sell the company that was with turner coming to us and saying hey we want to buy you guys um and you know from there that kicked off a whole process where you know we negotiated with them we started negotiating with other people and you know there's just a lot of kind of tricky balance that goes into something like that because on the one hand you know you're you know once you start you know agree to engage in a process like that you know you start to think about okay you know what do i need to do to get the deal done you know what all the diligence that goes into it all the you know kind of the planning of you know how you get to the finish line of the deal but then at the same time there's always a possibility that the deal doesn't happen or that it you know you decide to you know cut it off for some reason or they decide and you still have you're still operating business and you know you're still leading a team uh you know you're still you still need to think about the long term and you know kind of where you know where you're going to take the business if you don't sell it um and so you're kind of living in two different worlds and imagine doing that for eight or nine months um you know where you know and and there's you know there's some some interesting dynamics at play you have to decide at what point to bring other people on the team under the tent and kind of let them know what's happening because you do that too early and you know you know they get the same level of distractions that you do and all of a sudden like you know your your business progress can start to start to tank as everyone start to focus on the deal um but you know you do that too late and you risk you know kind of trust issues with the team or you you you at certain points you need to bring people in because you know they need to be involved in certain aspects of the diligence and again every deal is different usually you know the you know the the key management team is is is heavily involved in the process but um you know with at when we were selling bleacher report we had almost 250 employees at one point you know and it was still a few months before the deal closed the the news or the you know kind of the rumors of the negotiations leaked to the media uh so wall street journal wrote an article about it and you know we had to kind of talk to and say hey you know yeah there's reports out there yeah we're talking to you know turner we talk to other people we're always looking at you know kind of different you know what the best opportunity long term for the business is but as of right now you know you know we're we don't have a deal you know we're focused on you know building the company and you know we'll let you know if that changes but you know just that you know kind of that specter in itself can it just put you know puts the business in a very weird place so um so yeah it's it's it's definitely like a a real balancing act to to try to go through it because you know you're basically yeah you're you're living two different lives you know the whole time that that uh you know that the process goes on what are the dynamics of those leaks are when are they strategic when are they accidents how often when i read an article about a potential acquisition like that did someone plant that one of the people in the negotiation they put it there to maybe create havoc for the company that they're acquiring what's going on when i read an article like that yeah i mean there are always yeah there's always some story behind it you know it's everything from i've heard i've talked to journalists who like sat next to someone at a coffee shop or on an amtrak train and overheard you know the someone on the phone talking about an acquisition and you know there are stories like that where it's just completely random that something leaks but very often it's coming from someone on the inside and yeah i don't know for sure when that happened you know it could have been could have been from our side it could have been one of our bankers decided that you know the way he was gonna you know kind of get some other you know bidder to the table that he was trying to get to submit a counteroffer was by leaking you know to the media that we were we were close to closing our deal with turner it could have been from their side they could have been could have been a trial balloon just to see what the reaction was you know see how it you know you know impacted their stock price or something like that i mean i don't know that the bleacher deal was was that impactful on time order stock price at the time but yeah it could have been from them you know it's it's it's you know it's always there's always some some or almost always some deeper story to it and you know i think also you know journalists are especially journalists who are on that beat are good at you know cultivating sources and you know finding the people who will you know kind of slip them you know little slivers of info that you know they can then chase down so you know it can come from that way as well yeah it's one of the questions i always like to ask like when you see a big name in the media that hasn't been in the media for a while and this is different from leaks because they want to you always got to ask why why now and i think it's always an important question because people they come onto the stage and they disappear and there's always reasons for these things there's always people are very intentional about their media presence and i used to take it for granted oh there's a bunch of reed hastings articles that are in the newspaper now oh and then he was on tv oh that was a monday his book came out on the tuesday wait but then why is he writing the culture book and then you begin to get down these really interesting rabbit holes where then you begin to discover and get into a question like why would somebody like that spend three years on a book how much of it was them actually spending time on the book versus their public relations team and you can begin to discover a lot about the way that the world works through by looking at the implicit actions that people are taking rather than listening to explicitly what's being said um you know access journalism for for better for worse uh you know drives drives a lot of how the media works and um you know it's interesting you know i came into the media world as an as an outsider you know there was a while you know early on at bleach report i didn't even consider we we never consider ourselves a media company we were like a weird sports community you know uh type platform and then eventually we kind of realized oh no we're we're a media company we're you know we're creating content we're selling advertising you know we're building this brand um you know there's a there's a lot that you know i i kind of started to learn you know from that outsider's perspective about you know how media works and you know kind of see now seeing it more from the um it's been it's been uh been interesting to see it from from both perspectives you talk about the ways that you begin to see how media worked from the inside the things that surprise you and gary vaynerchuk once once gave this great speech it's like it's unlike the other stuff that he that he makes where he really goes into what he learned and the things that surprised him running an ad agency and he said that one of the things that surprised him the most was like this stepladder of saying awards they matter so much being on this the cranes list of best places to work they matter so much and then being like you know what actually people just pay to be on those things a lot of the times they don't matter at all but then saying wait they matter so much because all these other people think that they and so even though people are paying to be on those things that's actually how you get clients in the advertising agency business and going through that function of like surprise or thinking that something is a big deal nothing is a big deal then think it's a big deal again did you have any of those moments any of those realizations of just now being in the media business to be like whoa this world works very differently from how i thought oh absolutely and and that's that's a great example i mean when we when we like i said when we first kind of started to realize that we were a media business and that's what we were doing you know we you know bleacher report we started in san francisco we had some angel investors who were much more like technology investors they weren't necessarily media investors but you know they you know kind of believed in us early and and made some bets on us they were very very dubious at the idea of us being a media business and of us selling ad advertising they worked incredibly hard to try to convince us to get out of it to do something different not to get you know to you kind of bail on bleach report altogether but some different business model other than advertising or you know another thing they really try to push us on again with that more like tech silicon valley mindset is you know can we automate everything can we do it all self-serve the way google does and you know so that way we don't have to sell you know hire expensive sales people and all that type of stuff and you know first of all you know we kind of had to say hey google employs a ton of sales people like the self-serve stuff is just a you know kind of a small part of the or not a small part but it's just a part of their business uh and yeah i think the other part you know we we just had to you know kind of hold firm you know you know the way for us to you know to be a media company is you know we gotta establish ourselves in new york where you know most of the advertising sold we have to hire sales people we have to you know kind of go after the same brand advertisers who are advertising on espn or cbs or fox um and so we did and you know it just it was it was still surprising to me just how much that business is driven off relationships and kind of the you know the in-person deal-making and the you know taking the clients out to a nice steak dinner and or you know to you know there's something called jeans parties have you ever heard of these no i don't think they really happen anymore but they did back in they did back in those like days where literally uh you know a sales person would take a whole group of uh you know kind of people who work at an ad agency to what's called a jeans bar where they would all like hang out and i i never went to one so i don't know i don't know if they're drinking or what's happening but they all get fitted for custom jeans and it's like yeah basically you're you're buying everyone really nice jeans but like under the guise of we're hanging out we're entertaining clients and you know we're having a good time or you know there's jeans bars there's taking clients out to a sports game and there's all sorts of ways of basically you're just yeah quasi-bribing people to do business with you but in under the guise of we're going to show you a good time you know we're going to show you what good people we are we're going to build a relationship and you know ultimately you're going to be more predisposed to you know to do business so that i mean that yeah that was just like so surprising to me that this is how this was still how the advertising world works i mean you said like i'm a huge fan of uh of mad men um and you know it's just a fascinating uh you know show on many levels but a lot of what it depicts of the advertising industry back in the 60s you know is still in place today or certainly still in place you know in you know about 10 years ago and when you know we really started uh selling ads on bleacher a lot has changed since then i think you know some of you know a lot of the the ad agencies and and big advertisers have really like uh you know started to uh yeah really kind clamp down on you know that very egregious uh you know level of entertaining um and they're much more there are more controls uh around that um and i think the shift uh you know programmatic advertising has in effect made the world in some ways more like that automated you know ad sales world that our investors envisioned 10 years ago but there are still a lot of steak dinners or you know luxury suites at the concert or the knicks game or whatever you know happening in the advertising world and that still you know kind of indirectly or directly influences a lot of the major buying decisions that are happening you know spending 500 on a steak dinner and then ending up with a you know several hundred thousand dollar you know ad campaign is you know it's definitely a trade-off that i think you know most most publishers would make yeah i remember this was one of my nights in new york where i was like what is this world that i'm living in now i got invited to a dinner with some private equity guys and we went to wolfgang puck on 33rd and park so we sit down there's eight of us there's an nba player at the table there's a professional comedian at the table you know there's some big names at this at this dinner and i was really excited to be invited so i said sure i'll go and the the the hosts like i didn't even look at the menu and they must have ordered at least a bottle and a half of wine for every single person at the table and at a steakhouse these bottles of wine aren't cheap and the dinner was kind of a blur but i remember just going through steak after steak after steak and we had all these different kinds of steaks and at the end of the meal the guy said i will take care of it the host they said i'll take care of it but can you chip in a little and i chipped in 250 bucks after they took care of the meal and i was just like this is this is not a group i want to be a part of and i cannot believe that people in new york are doing this multiple times a week but it's the culture and you know exactly what you said it sounds so crazy at first like why would it ever make sense for them to drop a couple thousand dollars on a dinner i now know that they're pretty tight with this nba player the nba player is now a pretty big deal and if they get a a million dollar deal out of that night it's it's pennies compared to what they're making on the other place and so it's just like the scale of the money that was exchanged and i had season tickets to the golden state warriors grown up and my dad got some of the cheapest seats in the house i mean i remember we were all this was back when the warriors were bad and we had third deck seats and when you go from that of just like consumer spending to then the agency i worked for we had courtside seats at the nets and the whole calculus just changes shocked me man yeah yep yep well i mean i'm sure those are some fun warriors games i'm sure you saw back at the old oakland area that that place was was amazing but but yeah i know i mean that that whole like there's a whole economy around this you know this entertaining and this you know kind of clients or you know kind of interaction and i mean you you only i got to think that with the effects of covid and you know the shift to work from home and kind of we'll see how things you know start to reopen with finance and the advertising industry and things like that but you know a lot of these high-end restaurants you know so much of their business is from people on expense accounts entertaining clients taking people out be interesting to see what happens when you know kind of when all this shakes out whether they can still sustain that kind of business because i think you know so much of this is is gonna shift i mean we're yeah we're talking about it you know where i'm at bdg that you know in person me client meetings are you know not gonna happen for a while i mean we're talking until there's a vaccine and then you you know even after that i think people are getting used to doing more business over the phone online it's definitely it's just a different mindset now and it's kind of it's it's cutting out a lot of those you know more like entertaining relationship building aspects and and putting the focus more on you know just the business side so it'll be interesting to see like whether that returns or you know what how it changes or evolves uh yeah one of the you know one of the very secondary effects of uh you know the the world we're living in right now but uh just shows you how how widespread you know kind of these changes can be one of the things that you made very clear to me and i think it's a spot-on insight and was part of what went into you building inverse was the mainstreaming of geek culture that geeks are now taking over the world in a lot of ways you know it used to be it was weird there maybe wasn't a lot of money in it and then when i was growing up there were things like yu-gi-oh and pokemon there was a lot of money in that but it still wasn't like today now you have an explosion of video games you have nerds and people who ordinarily would be at the bottom of the social hierarchy now being at the top with silicon valley i mean normally engineers they weren't the wealthiest ones the wealthiest ones were the mad men people the people who were really good at socializing and really good looking and and often weren't quite as smart and now you have a world that really rewards intelligence and conscientiousness and a lot of the nerds are sort of on top and then you have ceos like elon musk who tap into that who love that geek culture what's going on behind that what was the insight that you had before starting inverse well i think you know the geeks won basically yeah the geeks took over and you know i love it uh you know before before i was a sports fan i was a geek i think i've always been a geek uh still today but i you know i i grew up reading comic books and obscure sci-fi novels and yeah just geeking out on on this stuff and i think i became kind of more of a a big sports fan uh you know as i you know kind of got into like middle school and high school like a lot of kids do but it's you know part of it was like to be less of a geek and to be you know more like you know conventionally cool um and you know but back when i was doing that it was you know it was not very cool to be a geek uh and then you know what we've seen i think over the last you know 15 20 years is you know all of a sudden all these kind of you know fringe cultural you know kind of ideas and franchises and things like that all the you know kind of you know things like computer science and you know technology have all kind of you emerged at the forefront um and so when i started inverse uh which was uh a little over five years ago you know that was kind of the central uh thesis is that geek culture has become mainstream and that's it's not just you know kind of the the you know the entertainment side of the culture but it's you know the you know kind of the the science the technology you know kind of aspects of being a geek are also mainstream um and yeah we you know you know we just decided we were going to cover that in a more mainstream way you know the same way that you know a bleacher report would cover sports uh and i think you know a great example you know you mentioned elon uh you know love him or hate him you know some people you know are you know idolize everything he has to say some people you know are you know roll their eyes anytime he you know spouts off on twitter about you know something but you know he has he's one of the biggest celebrities in the world now and he's got you know kind of a a devoted following and he's doing of course really amazing things at spacex and tesla etc uh but he's also you know he's just so central in the culture in a way that i think if you were to yeah kind of yeah turn the clock back you know five years and say like hey you know elon's gonna be you know this this massive figure that you know has millions upon millions of followers on twitter and is gonna be you know it you know it gonna be driving the culture in such a way it you would not expect it um and you know we like you know when we started inverse you know he was one of the big people that we decided we were gonna cover in a very deep way and i see a lot of parallels between kind of his personality and kind of the reaction we get we would get around him and the the engagement to um you know kind of some of the biggest athletes that we would cover at bleacher report and i think especially you know the big parallel uh is around kobe you know r.i.p when when uh you know in kind of the heyday of a bleacher report you know before the turner deal you know kobe was was you know kind of definitely you know he's still in his prime is still in the nba you know he was just the one athlete whenever we wrote about him whenever there was some big story around him it just got the most engagement on both sides a ton of people who love him a ton of people who hate him but everyone kind of you know respects him and you know is interested in what he's doing and you know i think elon is in a similar place now um and that's definitely you kind of it's a similar pattern anytime we cover him in inverse you know there's just always interest massive interest on both sides you know a legion of followers a lot of people who are you know not the biggest fans of him but still care about what he's doing um and that's just fascinating to me that we're in this place where you know this guy who in probably an earlier area arrow would just be a fringe figure you know you know aerospace 01:0:0,150 --> 01:0:2,799 01:0:0,160 --> 01:0:4,079 and you know kind of you know tech 01:0:2,789 --> 01:0:4,079 01:0:2,799 --> 01:0:7,839 entrepreneur 01:0:4,069 --> 01:0:7,839 01:0:4,079 --> 01:0:9,200 but now he's one of the most followed 01:0:7,829 --> 01:0:9,200 01:0:7,839 --> 01:0:12,960 people in the world 01:0:9,190 --> 01:0:12,960 01:0:9,200 --> 01:0:15,920 that's fascinating to me yeah 01:0:12,950 --> 01:0:15,920 01:0:12,960 --> 01:0:17,359 as you've been building media companies 01:0:15,910 --> 01:0:17,359 01:0:15,920 --> 01:0:20,799 how have you thought about 01:0:17,349 --> 01:0:20,799 01:0:17,359 --> 01:0:23,839 the the funnel of 01:0:20,789 --> 01:0:23,839 01:0:20,799 --> 01:0:24,400 getting people in versus retaining them 01:0:23,829 --> 01:0:24,400 01:0:23,839 --> 01:0:27,440 01:0:24,390 --> 01:0:27,440 01:0:24,400 --> 01:0:28,160 with bleacher you ran a search engine 01:0:27,430 --> 01:0:28,160 01:0:27,440 --> 01:0:30,240 optimization 01:0:28,150 --> 01:0:30,240 01:0:28,160 --> 01:0:31,760 strategy for top of the funnel and then 01:0:30,230 --> 01:0:31,760 01:0:30,240 --> 01:0:33,280 you did some things like 01:0:31,750 --> 01:0:33,280 01:0:31,760 --> 01:0:35,040 launching newsletters and then 01:0:33,270 --> 01:0:35,040 01:0:33,280 --> 01:0:37,440 eventually building an app to 01:0:35,030 --> 01:0:37,440 01:0:35,040 --> 01:0:38,240 retain people talk about that transition 01:0:37,430 --> 01:0:38,240 01:0:37,440 --> 01:0:39,440 and what are 01:0:38,230 --> 01:0:39,440 01:0:38,240 --> 01:0:43,040 what are some of the strategy 01:0:39,430 --> 01:0:43,040 01:0:39,440 --> 01:0:46,640 conversations going on there 01:0:43,030 --> 01:0:46,640 01:0:43,040 --> 01:0:50,160 yeah so with with bleacher it was very 01:0:46,630 --> 01:0:50,160 01:0:46,640 --> 01:0:50,559 organic uh and you know we we started 01:0:50,150 --> 01:0:50,559 01:0:50,160 --> 01:0:52,880 out 01:0:50,549 --> 01:0:52,880 01:0:50,559 --> 01:0:55,280 you know search was search was kind of 01:0:52,870 --> 01:0:55,280 01:0:52,880 --> 01:0:58,319 our pretty much our only option 01:0:55,270 --> 01:0:58,319 01:0:55,280 --> 01:0:59,920 to find new audiences social didn't you 01:0:58,309 --> 01:0:59,920 01:0:58,319 --> 01:1:0,559 know the way it didn't exist the way it 01:0:59,910 --> 01:1:0,559 01:0:59,920 --> 01:1:3,680 does now 01:1:0,549 --> 01:1:3,680 01:1:0,559 --> 01:1:5,040 at the time you know facebook was still 01:1:3,670 --> 01:1:5,040 01:1:3,680 --> 01:1:6,960 you know kind of in its early days 01:1:5,030 --> 01:1:6,960 01:1:5,040 --> 01:1:8,880 twitter i think was like literally 01:1:6,950 --> 01:1:8,880 01:1:6,960 --> 01:1:10,559 launched you know around the same time 01:1:8,870 --> 01:1:10,559 01:1:8,880 --> 01:1:12,480 we launched bleacher report 01:1:10,549 --> 01:1:12,480 01:1:10,559 --> 01:1:14,240 um so it was all that was all still very 01:1:12,470 --> 01:1:14,240 01:1:12,480 --> 01:1:16,400 new and you know 01:1:14,230 --> 01:1:16,400 01:1:14,240 --> 01:1:17,359 google was dominant search was the 01:1:16,390 --> 01:1:17,359 01:1:16,400 --> 01:1:19,440 primary way 01:1:17,349 --> 01:1:19,440 01:1:17,359 --> 01:1:20,480 people found you know their content 01:1:19,430 --> 01:1:20,480 01:1:19,440 --> 01:1:21,760 online unless they were 01:1:20,470 --> 01:1:21,760 01:1:20,480 --> 01:1:23,359 you know typing in and going to a 01:1:21,750 --> 01:1:23,359 01:1:21,760 --> 01:1:24,079 homepage or some a site they already 01:1:23,349 --> 01:1:24,079 01:1:23,359 --> 01:1:27,599 knew 01:1:24,069 --> 01:1:27,599 01:1:24,079 --> 01:1:30,720 um and yeah so you know kind of we 01:1:27,589 --> 01:1:30,720 01:1:27,599 --> 01:1:32,480 focused on you know creating content 01:1:30,710 --> 01:1:32,480 01:1:30,720 --> 01:1:34,000 that could rank well in search and 01:1:32,470 --> 01:1:34,000 01:1:32,480 --> 01:1:35,920 and kind of you know looking at that 01:1:33,990 --> 01:1:35,920 01:1:34,000 --> 01:1:37,920 supply demand equation that we talked 01:1:35,910 --> 01:1:37,920 01:1:35,920 --> 01:1:39,680 about and you know kind of finding those 01:1:37,910 --> 01:1:39,680 01:1:37,920 --> 01:1:42,720 those opportunities to 01:1:39,670 --> 01:1:42,720 01:1:39,680 --> 01:1:46,000 you know fill gaps in supply um 01:1:42,710 --> 01:1:46,000 01:1:42,720 --> 01:1:47,760 which worked incredibly well and we 01:1:45,990 --> 01:1:47,760 01:1:46,000 --> 01:1:49,760 you know kind of we really studied and i 01:1:47,750 --> 01:1:49,760 01:1:47,760 --> 01:1:51,200 think did it better than almost anyone 01:1:49,750 --> 01:1:51,200 01:1:49,760 --> 01:1:53,839 else at the time 01:1:51,190 --> 01:1:53,839 01:1:51,200 --> 01:1:55,520 to build our audience but a couple of 01:1:53,829 --> 01:1:55,520 01:1:53,839 --> 01:1:57,520 years in we started to notice problem we 01:1:55,510 --> 01:1:57,520 01:1:55,520 --> 01:1:59,200 were growing pretty steadily 01:1:57,510 --> 01:1:59,200 01:1:57,520 --> 01:2:0,960 um and then all of a sudden that growth 01:1:59,190 --> 01:2:0,960 01:1:59,200 --> 01:2:2,720 started to plateau 01:2:0,950 --> 01:2:2,720 01:2:0,960 --> 01:2:4,960 um and you know as we dug into the 01:2:2,710 --> 01:2:4,960 01:2:2,720 --> 01:2:8,559 audience we you know 01:2:4,950 --> 01:2:8,559 01:2:4,960 --> 01:2:10,640 we kind of observed a classic problem of 01:2:8,549 --> 01:2:10,640 01:2:8,559 --> 01:2:12,400 you know a lot of businesses you know 01:2:10,630 --> 01:2:12,400 01:2:10,640

01:8:12,880 01:8:11,200 --> 01:8:14,319 you know kind of the law of compounding 01:8:12,870 --> 01:8:14,319 01:8:12,880 --> 01:8:15,920 we were converting a certain percentage 01:8:14,309 --> 01:8:15,920 01:8:14,319 --> 01:8:18,560 of people each month and 01:8:15,910 --> 01:8:18,560 01:8:15,920 --> 01:8:19,759 they were sticking and over time that 01:8:18,550 --> 01:8:19,759 01:8:18,560 --> 01:8:22,960 just became 01:8:19,749 --> 01:8:22,960 01:8:19,759 --> 01:8:24,319 you know kind of a huge base of very 01:8:22,950 --> 01:8:24,319 01:8:22,960 --> 01:8:27,279 loyal people 01:8:24,309 --> 01:8:27,279 01:8:24,319 --> 01:8:29,279 and then you know about a year or so 01:8:27,269 --> 01:8:29,279 01:8:27,279 --> 01:8:31,600 after we launched the newsletters 01:8:29,269 --> 01:8:31,600 01:8:29,279 --> 01:8:32,560 uh you know this is the very early days 01:8:31,590 --> 01:8:32,560 01:8:31,600 --> 01:8:35,759 01:8:32,550 --> 01:8:35,759 01:8:32,560 --> 01:8:36,640 uh the the app store uh for for the 01:8:35,749 --> 01:8:36,640 01:8:35,759 --> 01:8:39,279 iphone 01:8:36,630 --> 01:8:39,279 01:8:36,640 --> 01:8:40,640 you know around like 2010 when it was 01:8:39,269 --> 01:8:40,640 01:8:39,279 --> 01:8:43,279 starting to open up 01:8:40,630 --> 01:8:43,279 01:8:40,640 --> 01:8:43,839 um you know to more developers and so we 01:8:43,269 --> 01:8:43,839 01:8:43,279 --> 01:8:45,520 launched 01:8:43,829 --> 01:8:45,520 01:8:43,839 --> 01:8:46,960 uh you know the bleacher report app it 01:8:45,510 --> 01:8:46,960 01:8:45,520 --> 01:8:48,239 was called team stream 01:8:46,950 --> 01:8:48,239 01:8:46,960 --> 01:8:50,560 at the time now it's just the bleacher 01:8:48,229 --> 01:8:50,560 01:8:48,239 --> 01:8:52,400 report app and it was basically the same 01:8:50,550 --> 01:8:52,400 01:8:50,560 --> 01:8:54,799 experience you get in the newsletters 01:8:52,390 --> 01:8:54,799 01:8:52,400 --> 01:8:56,159 but in an app you choose your teams you 01:8:54,789 --> 01:8:56,159 01:8:54,799 --> 01:8:59,920 get that curated feed 01:8:56,149 --> 01:8:59,920 01:8:56,159 --> 01:9:1,759 of everything that matters um and that 01:8:59,910 --> 01:9:1,759 01:8:59,920 --> 01:9:3,600 just you know drove the retention to a 01:9:1,749 --> 01:9:3,600 01:9:1,759 --> 01:9:4,640 new level and that was a real turning 01:9:3,590 --> 01:9:4,640 01:9:3,600 --> 01:9:7,520 point where 01:9:4,630 --> 01:9:7,520 01:9:4,640 --> 01:9:8,400 you know we went from you know i used to 01:9:7,510 --> 01:9:8,400 01:9:7,520 --> 01:9:10,400 go into 01:9:8,390 --> 01:9:10,400 01:9:8,400 --> 01:9:12,239 you know i was kind of the main you know 01:9:10,390 --> 01:9:12,239 01:9:10,400 --> 01:9:15,440 kind of lays on 01:9:12,229 --> 01:9:15,440 01:9:12,239 --> 01:9:17,279 uh you know at the company to like 01:9:15,430 --> 01:9:17,279 01:9:15,440 --> 01:9:18,480 the media world and you know meeting 01:9:17,269 --> 01:9:18,480 01:9:17,279 --> 01:9:21,040 with other companies 01:9:18,470 --> 01:9:21,040 01:9:18,480 --> 01:9:22,960 and you know kind of going out on some 01:9:21,030 --> 01:9:22,960 01:9:21,040 --> 01:9:24,640 of our early you know ad sales meetings 01:9:22,950 --> 01:9:24,640 01:9:22,960 --> 01:9:26,080 actually going all most meetings 01:9:24,630 --> 01:9:26,080 01:9:24,640 --> 01:9:28,319 expecting that no one had ever heard of 01:9:26,070 --> 01:9:28,319 01:9:26,080 --> 01:9:30,400 us or knew very little about us 01:9:28,309 --> 01:9:30,400 01:9:28,319 --> 01:9:33,279 and you know i'd kind of have to go in 01:9:30,390 --> 01:9:33,279 01:9:30,400 --> 01:9:34,640 and explain who we were and what we did 01:9:33,269 --> 01:9:34,640 01:9:33,279 --> 01:9:36,880 and then all of a sudden you know kind 01:9:34,630 --> 01:9:36,880 01:9:34,640 --> 01:9:38,480 of once once the newsletters and the 01:9:36,870 --> 01:9:38,480 01:9:36,880 --> 01:9:41,600 apps started to like 01:9:38,470 --> 01:9:41,600 01:9:38,480 --> 01:9:43,040 take off it completely changed i'd go 01:9:41,590 --> 01:9:43,040 01:9:41,600 --> 01:9:43,679 into meeting people like oh bleacher 01:9:43,030 --> 01:9:43,679 01:9:43,040 --> 01:9:46,560 report 01:9:43,669 --> 01:9:46,560 01:9:43,679 --> 01:9:47,520 i get your i've got the app i get my my 01:9:46,550 --> 01:9:47,520 01:9:46,560 --> 01:9:50,319 alerts on my 01:9:47,510 --> 01:9:50,319 01:9:47,520 --> 01:9:51,440 you know my miami hurricanes news 01:9:50,309 --> 01:9:51,440 01:9:50,319 --> 01:9:52,159 because that's where i went to school 01:9:51,430 --> 01:9:52,159 01:9:51,440 --> 01:9:54,960 and like 01:9:52,149 --> 01:9:54,960 01:9:52,159 --> 01:9:56,239 that that whole dynamic started to 01:9:54,950 --> 01:9:56,239 01:9:54,960 --> 01:9:59,760 change where 01:9:56,229 --> 01:9:59,760 01:9:56,239 --> 01:10:1,520 you know we went from complete unknown 01:9:59,750 --> 01:10:1,520 01:9:59,760 --> 01:10:4,159 to you know the people in the sports world in the media world at large you know really knew us and and you know it was it was a real inflection point for the company two more questions the first is you say that most people climb a career ladder and you've tried to create a career elevator what do you mean by that so um you know i think there you know there's similar to that idea around kind of taking taking control and changing your situation um you know a lot of people feel like they have to take a conventional path in life and you know certainly everyone's circumstances are different you know so you know some people have to you know just you know do what they need to do to kind of you know survive and and take that next step the world is full of examples of people yeah who kind of you know tried to go down the conventional path and and hit a wall and and really broke out when they took matters into their own hands um you know i when i started out uh you know kind of in you know right out of college you know i went to go to usc film school and i originally i wanted to be a filmmaker producer uh you know inspired by back to the future and science fiction and all that you know took a fairly conventional path to try to get there you know when went to work in a talent agency uh yeah right out of school is kind of thinking of oh this is the way i get my foot in the door you know i'll i'll go and work at this talent agency learn the business build a network and kind of you know climb the ladder that way um it was it was a fascinating uh you know world to kind of like be a fly on the wall in um but you know i i kind of recognize at some point that not necessarily it wasn't for me but that that path wasn't wasn't the best way to to get where i wanted to go and you know really that light bulb uh turned on for me you know when this whole time i was working there and and trying to kind of like build relationships with studios and producers and kind of the other my peers at the agency uh i was working on bleacher report as a side project and it was you know kind of this secret thing i would go and like you know go and you know go into the stairwell at the agency like secretly do do conference calls with my co-founders to like you know work on things you know on my break um and you know the the agency was was just starting to like dip its toe into the digital world at the time and this was like you know very you know kind of early on you know the emergence of digital media and um yeah they were kind of trying to figure it out and so i thought oh well i'm working on this you know website side project you know the agency's trying to figure out digital maybe i'll raise my hand and this will be my way to like climb the ladder um and so i started to you know try to get involved in you know the this digital task force they were putting together and just go into a couple of those meetings and see kind of seeing their approach to it i i started to realize hey i get this stuff a lot more than a lot of the more senior people around the table do and you know i can be here as a very junior person trying to like climb the ladder and you know maybe use this as my ticket or i can get out of here and i can go focus on this project that i believe in and instead of climbing the ladder i'm building an elevator and you know building something and that can be you know my ticket up and my ticket to a career and of course it could have you know completely failed you know could have not worked out at all and maybe i would have been back you know at the bottom of the ladder but yeah i think i think anyone you know who really has you know strong conviction in you know wanting to get somewhere in their life in their career you know can kind of find that you know that equivalent way to take matters into their own hands could be by going all in and starting a company or you know leaving the corporate world or whatever it could be by you know launching their own blog or podcast or you know working on some i mean just some way to kind of build your calling card you know rather than you know kind of wait for the path to open up in front of you and i think that's you know that's that's just a lesson that a lot of people can take and um you know certainly serve me well yeah i mean that's why i started read a passage i've always believed that no matter what you want to do writing online and building an audience is is going to serve you well and it is a path that works well for people who have a definite vision of what they want to do and uh indefinite one of they know they're ambitious but they don't know where they want to direct their ambitions but i want to end this with three quotes that illustrate your personal principles the first is from hunter s thompson when the going gets weird the weird turn pro the second from john fishman get your ass handed to you every day and the last one from warren zevin or zevon yeah sivan from warren zevon enjoy every sandwich break down those three and talk about what they mean to you all right uh so the honorary s thompson quote um yeah i i love his writing and just yeah kind of the you know talk about building a world uh you know he definitely did through his writing uh you know i think you know that resonates with me around you know how how we built bleacher report you know how i look at launching any project is you know there's you you kind of have to take advantage of the weirdness in the world and you know that's where the opportunities are when there's you know kind of a shift in things and you know that's uh you know i think the the people who build big businesses or who you know kind of take big swings uh you are are often you know kind of emerging from some fringe you know kind of idea or french part of the world that you know that you know all of a sudden becomes a movement um and so yeah that's that's always uh that's always resonated with me and and you know i think it uh it speaks to you know you gotta find uh have a vision you know create a mission around it and and you know find those people who who believe in it and you know that can turn into something big um the the the fishman quote by the way he's the the fisherman john fishman the drummer from fish so that is a uh this is a quote from a lyrics from a song that he wrote not too long ago called ass handed um that is perhaps the the short one of the shortest songs in the the fish repertoire of amongst uh you know they're known for their you know 20 minute plus songs this one's you know maybe a minute long with you know the only lyrics being you get your ass handed to you every day and you know i think that to me you know it's a hilarious song uh but it also it's it just speaks to humility and not taking yourself too seriously uh and you know it's something that you know i've been reminded again and again whether it was in my early days you know trying to make it or you know after achieving success and you know being a dad all these different things like there's just some days where you get your ass handed to you and you just have to take it and move on and and kind of be ready to laugh at yourself and uh and keep going forward um and uh you know i'm i'm you know reminded that a little too much as a you know chasing my two kids around and trying to trying to you know keep up um and then uh you know the the zevon quote um so enjoy every sandwich was the answer he gave yeah warren's yvonne uh was a you know a a really you know critically acclaimed and prolific singer-songwriter you know who's you know kind of one of you know like a real songwriter songwriter you know you know bob dylan admired him and you know for for his lyrics and things like and he uh in the early 2000s he was diagnosed with terminal cancer um you know fairly fairly young i think he was in his 50s um and he he was a favorite guest of david letterman uh on the letterman show so he went on the show as one of his last uh you know public appearances you know a few months before he died um to perform and you know kind of do an uh kind of almost a farewell interview with letterman and you know letterman you know his own way was asking him about death and coming to terms with it and said hey do you have any you know you've lived a you know a interesting life a full life but you know you're you know now you've kind of faced with this you know impending into it you know do you have have you gained any insight you know now that you can kind of look at your life and at its you know point of near completion that you want to share with us any you know kind of life advice and he said enjoy every sandwich and you know i think it's just it's it's profound in a way uh and it's it's really about i mean you you know you can have success you can have great experiences you can have great struggles you can still find you know kind of the the joy and the satisfaction in the little things and in in kind of the the everyday pleasures of the everyday struggles um and you know that's that's uh you know big part of my philosophy is just you know finding meaning in the moment and and kind of letting that be the thing that that drives you forward beautiful well thank you for an amazing conversation jam-packed with wisdom and as soulful as it was intellectual so thank you very much well thanks david this has been a lot of fun appreciate it
