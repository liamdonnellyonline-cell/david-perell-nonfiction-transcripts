so you're talking about two m a deals that you've done bleacher and inverse having never done one myself what would surprise me the most about doing an m a deal outside of the mental health component outside of the emotional component just about the tactical business components of of what you actually do what would surprise me the most um i mean unfortunately the you know the one of the surprises just how grueling they are and how you know i think you know certainly i can't speak for every deal and every process but our experience at uh at bleacher you know it was a nine month eight nine month process yeah from start to finish uh of selling the company and that was you know we were not trying to sell the company that was with turner coming to us and saying hey we want to buy you guys um and you know from there that kicked off a whole process where you know we negotiated with him we started negotiating with other people um and you know there's just a lot of kind of tricky balance that goes into something like that because on the one hand you know you're you know once you start you know agree to engage in a process like that you know you start to think about okay you know what do i need to do to get the deal done you know what all the diligence that goes into it all the you know kind of the planning of you know how you get to the finish line of the deal but then at the same time there's always a possibility that the deal doesn't happen or that it you know you decide to you know cut it off for some reason or they decide and you still have you're still operating business and you know you're still leading a team uh you know you're still you still need to think about the long term and you know kind of where you know where you're going to take the business if you don't sell it and so you're kind of living in two different worlds and imagine doing that for eight or nine months you know where you know and and there's you know there's some some interesting dynamics at play you have to decide at what point to bring other people on the team under the tent and kind of let them know what's happening because you do that too early and you know you know they get the same level of distractions that you do and all of a sudden like you know your your business progress can start to start to tank as everyone start to focus on the deal um but you know you do that too late and you risk you know kind of trusted issues with the team or you you you at certain points you need to bring people in because you know they need to be involved in certain aspects of the diligence and again every deal is different usually you know the you know the the key management team is is heavily involved in the process but um you know with at when we were selling bleacher report we had almost 250 employees at one point you know and it was still a few months before the deal closed the the news or the you know kind of the rumors of the negotiations leaked to the media uh some wall street journal wrote an article about it and you know we had to kind of talk to the team and say hey you know yeah there's reports out there yeah we're talking to you know turner we talk to other people we're always looking at you know kind of different you know what the best opportunity long term for the business is but as of right now you know you know we're we don't have a deal you know we're focused on you know building the company and you know we'll let you know if that changes but you know just that you know kind of that specter in itself can it just put you know puts the business in a very weird place so um so yeah it's it's it's definitely like a a real balancing act to to try to go through it because you know you're basically yeah you're you're living two different lives you know the whole time that that uh you know that the process goes on
