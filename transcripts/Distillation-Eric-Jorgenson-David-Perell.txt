it's a very rite-of-passage-y idea too one of the things we talk about is how it takes 50 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup and that you're always trying to distill that sap to create this really sugary syrup what did you learn about how a message changes as you begin to compress an idea down to its essence yeah i think there's a really there's a tough trade-off you make as you keep distilling where you start to lose people the more precise you get so you know one of the decisions is like there's a lot of um there's a lot of terms in here and a lot of words that if you haven't read you know if you aren't familiar with mental models or if you don't have some of the silicon valley jargon or if you haven't read you know any to leave or even you know heard a talk by him it kind of goes over your head um and i had some editors really pressed me to define things like you need to add a paragraph a definition of anti-fragile and i'm like i don't know that's really gonna slow people down who already do know about it and i don't mind forcing people to go look that up or get curious about it if they see it again and so the more you distill um a lot of times you know like if you distill all the way down to productize yourself and you say only productize yourself nobody knows what you're talking about if you have this tweet storm some people are going to understand some of those tweets but if you don't have kind of an intuitive understanding of what accountability means and how it relates to risk or how the power of compounding like actually derives incredible returns over time like if you don't if you can't unfold the word compounding into two pages of how important this idea is and what it is when you distill it all of a sudden you're losing millions of people who don't understand that and who can't kind of like open up that subfolder in their head and appreciate the importance of that concept and so i'm hoping with this book that you know i don't think naval has the patience to go like write out the two pages of compounding and like you know define every little thing um and so i'm hoping that this book kind of takes a step a little bit above the tweet storm that like if you can't quite read the tweet storm and expand all of that in your head to be like oh my god i know how i had to live my life now um that this blows out some of those uh concepts and defines them better but not so much that they are you know that a first grader could understand them certainly like there are people for this book will still go over their head they'll still need to google things like that's perfectly fine like i want it to be a reference um a high density like high value reference for people who like want to keep unfolding it and keep distilling and see a few more examples and see a few more applications um really bridge that gap between like hey i read the tweet storm and like i can apply this to my own business and my own life like today and and that's the difference between distilling too far and and expanding too far i hope we thread that needle appropriately
