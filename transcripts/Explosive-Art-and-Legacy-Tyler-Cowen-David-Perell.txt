what can writers learn in terms of having a more prolific and productive output from artists i think a lot of artists work only occasionally and in bursts that's not how i write some writers work that way it seems more common amongst us say painters at least and i don't know why the difference is it's one thing i've always wanted to understand better but the nature of inspiration it seems to be lumpier more convex somehow so the artist is kind of waiting and then explodes and again some writers are like that right uh proust at one point he just wrote remembrance of things past didn't do that much before then obviously was dying didn't do anything significant afterwards uh thomas mann it seems exploded periodically with masterworks but was not a journalist writing every day it could be you know the very greatest talents explode cervantes would be another example was in prison he wrote don quixote his other works i mean they're interesting i wouldn't say they're not good but they're not really close to don quixote so it could be the convexification of the highest forms of creativity uh something we should learn more from but i'm pretty sure i'm not the person who will figure that out i'm too non-convex write every day write a small amount if needed just keep on going music composition is an interesting area if you look at johan sebastian bach i mean one of the greatest geniuses it's pretty clear he was always composing he was like a lot of these writers shakespeare seems pretty actively to have been writing also and he and bach may be the two greatest geniuses in western cultural history for they were actually not very lumpy picasso also wasn't lumpy do you worry that do you think about legacy no when i'm dead i'm dead uh you know it's nice if somehow it's helped the people i've known had better lives but i'm not at all like oh will people still read me first i'm pretty sure they won't a second i'm not sure i would care that much if they did i do care that they read me now though i'm not saying it doesn't matter but i've spent a lot of time actually studying the half-lives of ideas and hardly anything happening now will still be read in 20 years time really close to nothing but if i've had influence or produced benefits now that's enough for me but it really doesn't matter if the percentage of things that you've written that have influenced like you were just talking about don quixote that was the one book that stood out it doesn't it matter it's much more of a tail distribution well but it's become a tail distribution where hardly anything in non-fiction still gets read so you take someone like gary becker in his lifetime i think he was the most cited economist for many years he could have won five or six nobel prizes helped build an enduring program at university of chicago one of the top half dozen nobel laureates in my opinion of what is now a pretty large group he's not read anymore so like milton friedman is barely still red like what is it i should hope for i think it's unre i have this debate with robin hansen so robin really wants people or maybe m's you know to read him after he's gone the m's will read him i'm sure if that's what it comes to but i don't think the people will so i say maximize impact now but most of all maximize your own learning like be pretty selfish in that regard at least henry george was like that too right yes he's had an amazing impact up to the current day but he's not that much red and his impact probably does not come from him still being read because he has read very rarely i actually put on a whole two-day seminar to read through progress in poverty with a number of people including peter thiel this was just a phenomenal event we had a small group everyone was totally dedicated to the book just like sessions all day long we had some georgist specialists there some historians uh i had a blast that was great but again one thing i learned is how few people are reading that book
