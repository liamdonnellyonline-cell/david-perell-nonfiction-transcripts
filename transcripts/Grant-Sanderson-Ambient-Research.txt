one of the things that i think you and i both agree on is you don't want to start a video right at the beginning of your research process you know like there's a idea that's kind of ingrained in school it's like okay welcome to u.s history class at the end of the semester you're going to write a paper on the civil war so now is time to start researching and then you know exactly you're going to write your research research research but that's actually tremendously costly what's better to do is to the word that you used was ambient research and you exist in this state where you're just interested in math and through that process you're realizi you're researching a lot of things without even knowing it and then one day well you find your hook and it all comes together and now it's time to make the video what is that process like for you it's exactly what we were talking about earlier where that's why idleness and distraction are valuable it's because those are like in a sense the ambient research phase so it looks like uh just reading books or being willing to get caught into a rabbit hole of an interesting question um and like not feeling guilty about part of the day washing away to that effect and then just keeping notes and having a spot that i can turn to on those notes at some point um it's like kind of as simple as that and very often if you were to actually track like where an idea came from for a video like the seeds of it's it like years before the the production process started what do those notes look like oh i mean sometimes it's like literal um like pad of paper and pencil just like scrapped at the side of the computer um sometimes it's just like a text editor document that's open while i'm reading something uh it's it's it's probably not as organized as it should i've got like a long asana list of like potential video topics and like the detail section of each one will have a little scrapped um like bullet point uh of important points um yeah it's it's honestly not terribly organized if i if i'm like open with you what percentage of your notes are drawings and visual versus text and more logical honestly actually a lot a lot more logical than like text um i think there's like isolated different i'm just like falling to my notebook now i guess i guess drawings i guess maybe like on the pendant paper it's like 50 things that are like sketched in drawings but then a lot like that's where you'll maybe like work something out and so often if you like let's say you want to find an intuitive explanation of something in that often the first step is to like actually go through the non-intuitive explanation um like the most recent thing that's sitting in front of me here is like trying to understand why um like a binomial distribution tends to look like a gaussian with large numbers and just kind of like working out um how sterling's approximation on factorials like makes that pop out and if there's an elegant way that it does and in that case i guess the central question in mind after doing that is to like look at the algebra and say are there parts of this that felt like they must be true in a way that could be like visual or could be better motivated or something like that i don't think this particular page would ever like turn into a video but that's um yeah that's i think kind of a valuable thing to do is to just like get into the nitty-gritty of like working it out in like the boring algebraic way so that you can assess like does it have to be as boring as it as it seems
