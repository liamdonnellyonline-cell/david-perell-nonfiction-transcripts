so i'm gonna get right into it grant why do people love prime numbers so much i talk to people who are interested in math and you start talking about prime numbers and it's like a kid watching an airplane take off for the first time over and over and over again what's going on there well they're deeply fundamental so in the same way that atoms build up all of the molecules in the world you have the sense that when you're studying numbers just counting numbers multiplicatively like these are the fundamental building blocks and often when you're solving a problem um breaking it down in terms of primes if you're doing something multiplicative that's like the first step and yet despite them being so fundamental and one of the first things you'd ask about there's just this pile of unanswered questions about them and it's it's one of the few places where it doesn't take too much digging before and you find yourself at the forefront of what people even know so just to list like a handful of famous conjectures in this direction you've got the twin prime conjecture are there infinitely many that are just two apart the goldbach conjecture um can you always express an even number as the sum of two prime numbers um are there infinitely many what are called like mercen primes that look like um two to some power minus one uh just a lot of things in this vein and more often than not what you'll find is these unsolved questions come when you ask additive questions about primes so like twin prime are they two apart you're asking an additive question about a multiplicative structure um and that that mixture seems to be this perfect recipe for just injecting math right into that realm that we have no idea how to answer it um even though like a lot of good work has been done on that on these sorts of questions um even just like within the last decade or two but yeah so i i not to rent too much but i was definitely one of those people that like as a kid first heard twin prime conjecture was immediately captivated right and you have that little light bulb that goes off that is born from a mixture of curiosity and naivety which is like what if i could be one to like make progress on such a thing um and i think a lot of mathematicians in their youth like have that kind of relationship with if not prime numbers other kinds of questions like um like the um hailstone conjecture or such that are easy to phrase but turn out to be very hard to solve so i want to go down that rabbit hole of as a kid because you said something interesting there what was or what were the moments that got you inspired to be into math and what you said there was is sort of where i want to point at this question you said if i could make progress but i see you much more as like a carl sagan of like somebody who is translating the world of math to millions of people on youtube and you've probably done more in furthering my granted limited understanding of math than than anyone else that i follow and so how much do you see yourself as sort of what was implied by that answer of expanding the frontier versus making the frontier that already exists legible to a certain set of people in the world oh yeah to be clear i'm not a researcher and at some point kind of if i like look back but at my path it sort of switched gears in the direction of exactly what you phrased pretty well there which is um trying to find different perspectives on things that are known rather than trying to uh like forge into things that are unknown um i don't know we can drill into like why i didn't necessarily go into research but well i don't know if i have a great answer uh i can like speculate around it but maybe there was another part of your question there which is just why i fell in love with the subject to begin with and those might actually end up being kind of related because um you know the pure reasons to give would be something like oh i just saw the beauty of like numbers of these patterns like helen love really and i think this is probably true of a lot of people um there's probably a lot more ego than that because you know especially when you're like a young male there's a little bit more focus on like yourself and whether you're at the top of things than um at other points in life or other demographics out there so uh like my dad played a lot of math games with me when i was like very little and he clearly wanted both his sons to be like curious people as a lot of fathers do and i think that just sort of got into this positive feedback loop where at some point pretty young i like self-identified as being good at math and then when you self-identify that way you like it and then when you like it you spend more ambient time just like in the back of your mind staring into space thinking about it and like that that really gets this flywheel rolling um and it probably wasn't until like high school that i had a love of math that was pure in a sense of just like loving the beauty of it and letting myself get engaged with it that that way in all of the ways that like nowadays i try to promote and get other people into um but i think if i look at like my undergrad time i've said this in other outlets before but probably my biggest regret is not having engaged more heavily with um like the researchers and professors and mathematicians that i had access to uh for for no good reason other than like shyness i guess uh mixed with maybe feeling a little bit more um warm towards the computer science department than the math department despite the fact that i was like studying math and i think honestly if i had been a little bit more engaged there it would have been more likely that i like got pulled into uh like a traditional research route but at the same time i don't know that like i don't you clearly do things on the internet you've got like this podcast and you've got this kind of personal life investment in the idea of stuff broadcast over the internet there was a part of me that just had this feeling that academia over the next like couple decades felt like a less stable life bet than trying to establish some kind of footprint on the internet and also just um the things that bring me the most joy usually take the form of new perspective on known things rather than that sense of like being in this totally black room where you're not entirely sure what's going on and it's not even clear if things ever will become clear um and that might just be a personality personality quirk yeah there was a quote that you gave in your ted talk and it is the mathematician does not study pure mathematics because it is useful he studies it because he delights in it and he delights in it because it is beautiful and i think that speaks to a lot of what you've been saying here and the question that i have for you is how much do you think of math as like a closed system in itself that has this internal beauty versus something that is beautiful because of its explanatory power and because it has its boots on the ground with reality personally i like it much more when it is clear where those boots are and i over time i think i've been getting increasingly fed up with math that doesn't even try to uh draw that connection to reality mainly because if you have um a desired application or at least the threshold of we need to be related to another field that's not math in order to take it seriously then you can't move the goal posts and you can't just have a paper that says here's something that we're pursuing simply because a field medalist once asked the question um and when you can't move the goal posts it forces you to innovate whereas if you're just kind of leaning back on the idea of oh well it's intrinsically interesting and something something beauty something something not theory then it there's no clarity on whether what you required pushing yourself to innovate rather than just taking what was um readily findable based on like intuitions that you already had and results that were already uh like primed to be built upon and honestly i do think there's different categories of mathematicians here where you have some that honestly do not care about application um either because they just love the idea of pure abstraction as a powerful thought mechanism like people who get really into category theory without any care for application though a lot of category theories do care to be clear um and then you have some that just love puzzles um like common notorious i think probably disproportionately fall into this category of those who just love puzzles and the kind of puzzles that math brings about uh and it doesn't doesn't really care if it's touching the world but there was just a wide swath especially those who came at it through physics who who think of math as as a tool and like the reason that it's beautiful is because of its um you know the eugene wigner unreasonable effectiveness that it provides and i think the more the time goes on the more i fall into that latter category of really really needing to see maybe not a direct connection but it's some semblance of a path towards the real world before i'm i'm comfortable describing something um as as worthy as beautiful as uh uh like good high quality math one of the things that i've been grappling with and actually struggling with is what is the role of studying things for the sake of studying them in my life and one of my biggest concerns and now that i'm living with a mathematician which is awesome because i'm realizing that there's a whole you know it's almost as if i didn't see the color blue until 15 days ago when we moved in together it was like you know looking at the world and you see something new and it's like wait i don't actually have that language have those models in my head to be able to try to understand reality and i've had a lot of these same conversations around philosophy of trying to get into the lineage of western thought but there's something about it that doesn't have that that practicality to it and so as you study math how do you think about the trade-off between studying math for the sake of just studying it because it's beautiful because you want to learn it and then how much of your study of it is in direct pursuit of a video or a problem that you're actively grappling with well i think you hit the nail on the head with the very last part there these days almost entirely i'm viewing things through the lens of can i use this either in a video or in something expository that is hopefully just enjoyable to consume for someone else and there's a couple reasons something might be enjoyable to consume a lot of times it's because of that application it's physically relevant uh but there are there are times when just the pure story in and of itself like prime number of puzzles are great example of this that you opened with there's something intrinsically fascinating does not need any more direct motivation beyond that if anything it's always kind of awkward whenever people are talking about prime numbers and like almost as an obligatory thing in the footnote of their article they're like by the way prime numbers are used for cryptography without like much more of an explanation than that and it's this desperate grappling hook that number theorists have on like the the utility of their subject but that doesn't at all capture why they're interested in it almost no one is interested in primes because of their application of cryptography the thing that hooks them is this bizarre thing that's going on with why is something that's so simple to describe so hard to draw conclusions about and i just think of these as two different categories of videos of of expository possibilities um but everything that i like think about these days ends up going through that lens um so it's not an either or and one thing that i'll often lean on if i'm trying to you know put some sort of conclusion at the end of a video that is a little bit more like inside the internal bubble of math without application is to emphasize that the kind of problem-solving abilities and patterns that you're coming to recognize and all of these intuitions being built through the pure puzzles very often become relevant um just as as a set of problem-solving muscles so even if you're sitting back you're like when am i ever going to use this and there's not a direct answer to the like the this of this topic and video you know solving some imo problem or something like that you have to acknowledge that the people who do solve these things like those who did math olympiads when they were um in high school or like did the putnam type stuff when they were in college there's just this high correlation between them and people who do useful technical things for society later on and like that's obviously not a coincidence and it's not because they're applying like the weird esoteric problems of the imo in their real life like usually there's no direct application but there's some kind of deep-seated set of abstractions for what patterns we recognize what problem-solving tactics we've been exposed to and like built the muscles for that is hard to articulate but nevertheless very worth thinking about and valuing and um using as a justification to spend that afternoon thinking about a puzzle that has no earthly bearing on physical reality yeah i want to sort of follow this little theme and i'm going to call it the usefulness of useless knowledge and i see the same thing with philosophy and physics so it's as if they touch some substrate of reality that isn't directly applicable immediately and i've seen programs especially in philosophy they're like practical philosophy programs and what's really interesting is the second that you add that word practical you kind of destroy the thing that made philosophy great and so it's almost like there is a usefulness over certain time horizons that maybe learning a certain idea that most people would consider useful is thinking about useful in terms of it'll be useful in the next weeks the next month but i think that what you're trying to get at here is a usefulness of a lifetime and a usefulness of finding either meaning in your life or being able to have a lens on the world that most people don't have because they didn't have the time horizon to study some of these things that's yeah i mean one great example of that with philosophy it seems like um like business leaders in silicon valley are heavily as philosophy grads and that you just have to acknowledge that there's something going on there um and in much the same way that pure math enthusiasts end up heavily over-represented in like computer science and stuff that's like heavily um applied even if that might not be the reasons they got into it i think one of the things that's happening here um i i mean i guess i used the phrase before which is like pattern recognition straight up pattern recognition where there's phenomena that happen in the world that don't necessarily have words to them but um you know like if you have a really good sense for convexity let's say like you thought about the difference of squares and like the strange idea that you know when you um multiply two numbers that are uh like equally distant around some midpoint the the product of them is a little bit less than the square of that midpoint and like that as a as a loose hard to articulate pattern like comes up in so many different ways and maybe in a computer science landscape it looks like convex optimization or maybe um it looks like understanding um like geometry of complex numbers in a certain way that then gets applied to like electrical engineering like all sorts of just little nuggets that happen when you really let yourself meditate on like a raw pattern in and of itself that's one thing and then the other is uh i think there's like a social component here where the kinds of people who are comfortable nerding out about particular kinds of math and puzzles then get drawn to each other and then you know when people are together then they exchange thoughts on all sorts of other things and that that level of collaborative um socializing might not just be amplifying what pure puzzles they're talking about but also oh like i've been dealing with this like new programming problem do you want to help me think about it or in the context of people who are into philosophy you know they get together and have this long dinner chat over the hegelian dialectic but then as like a side product having brought together all these like minds they find themselves chatting about something that's more like directly useful and so almost just as a like a common social thread to bring certain kinds of minds together and then once they are together that's a a net productive thing that seems to be a big part of what um what lies behind these like correlations between the philosophers and the silicon valley ceos and the mathematicians and the programmers yeah i think that there's a lot of truth to that in terms of especially the silicon valley ceos that's something that i've always been very interested in i mean one of my theories here is that a lot of these people just would have been academics and then the actual money and the intellectual joy of solving a lot of these problems and just the profitability of it took a lot of those people like paul graham comes to mind outside of the world of academia and maybe brought them into the world of entrepreneurship but one of the questions that i wanted to ask you was you know you mentioned the two primes conjecture and we've made progress on that say in the last 15 years there was a major development with fermat's last theorem in the 1990s in what sense do you think that there's stagnation in math or do you see an exponential improvement how do you try to deal with that question i mean it would be pretty hard to take the stance that there's not an accelerating rate of progress i've heard some like cynics in that direction and it's such a you almost want to take it because it's this delightfully contrarian thing like oh you know we've invested 10 times as much but we're not making any more progress but that's just it just doesn't bear out um certainly if you're measuring it in terms of papers published then yeah you've got this like exponential increase but uh you know a lot of papers might be frivolous and it might not actually be making progress in the right ways but i think even in the right ways like i mean one of the most important questions you can ask in math that maybe not enough people ask is what should the axioms be like it's not just a pursuit of what theorems are true giving some set of vaccines that we start with but stepping back and saying what is the right framework to even be viewing all of this and i mean one of the biggest things that characterizes math in the last century as differentiated from those in prior centuries is viewing it through like a lens of um categories and very like top down in abstraction as opposed to through the lens of it's not directly opposite you can have categories and sets but oftentimes like either you're thinking of a certain construct in terms of a set theoretical way like how do you build it bottom up versus category theoretic which is much more leaning on an object is defined by its relationship with other things now that's not that's not exactly like this concrete oh you're going to touch the world in a certain way result it's not exactly something that um is like this named theorem per se it's more just like this general perspective that's moved its way in um and there seems to be a lot of thoughts like that where people are asking deeper questions rather than just how do i get to like some new theorem so that i can publish as many papers as possible though to be clear that like is happening um and also just like in terms of looking at a scoreboard on um like how many unsolved problems are getting solved uh there was this famous address that hilbert gave in um 1900 sort of at the turn of the century laying out a bunch of problems that he saw as like particularly important and a lot of them were like maybe ill-posed and not exact but if you just look through like how many of those were solved in the last century um i think it's fair to say we're doing pretty well uh there remain ones that aren't answered things like you know the ramon hypothesis is maybe the big one um but you know an echoing of hilbert's problems came in 2000 with the clay math institute you know putting out million dollar prizes for seven um specific unsolved problems and on the one hand only one out of the seven has been solved so far like hey one out of seven that ain't bad given that we're just at the very beginning of this uh century and they were listed as like the millennium problems um and they're just like you know very famously hard and a lot of the partial progress made towards them that's like that's what actually matters like no one cares if there's um two infinitely many primes that are two apart that's never gonna make a cryptographic algorithm more secure or anything like that but because it necessitates creating new ideas and new math in order to even attack it um it's i think highly likely that whatever did solve that would find application elsewhere so all of the partial progress being made towards these kinds of unsolved problems um that's sort of where the meat is and yeah i just there is that part of me that wishes i could stand and give a good justified contrarian view that like ah math is slowing down when you need to like accelerate the progress engine again but it just doesn't bear out good i'm happy to hear that you know you mentioned the axioms earlier on is there anything in math that's sort of like physics where you have newtonian physics and you have einsteinian physics and they're both axiomatic but they don't quite square up and it's like there's something in the foundation of mathematics that is nagging the field oh are you familiar with girdles theorem no bring it on oh great okay so great one of the um kind of ill-posed things that hilbert set out in this 1900 speech was like giving a rigorous foundation to math like finding the right axioms where let's just say we're talking about facts about numbers you want some maximum system that will describe numbers such that anything that's true about numbers is provable right you could use those axioms you could use first order logic you could just like go and prove something that's true about the numbers um and that ever so every truth is accessible in this way and that it's internally consistent that you can't prove false things seems reasonable that feels like what math should do it's like yes anything that's true we should be able to prove it uh we shouldn't have inconsistencies people like worked on this one such young lad who worked on this particularly hard was kurt girdle and i think oh god i'm going to get the timeline wrong um but you know a decade or two uh after this is kind of like posed god comes out and it's like ah turns out not possible i'm sorry what it's like any axiom system that you have um there's there's going to be a true fact about numbers that it cannot prove or it's inconsistent it's like well that's unsettling that whatever foundation we have there's there exists a truth something that we know will be true about numbers but it can't be proven um and so it's just this like red queen game of which if you shift your axiom uh systems in another way then there's going to be another fact that's true but you can't prove it and for a while it seemed like okay yeah but the way that girdle discovered this stuff it was um this very self-referential thing where you start with you know how when you say a statement like this statement is a lie and then you think about it you're like is that statement true well it's true it's not if it isn't uh if it's not then it is but that's language that's not like rigorous math essentially what girdle did was he took that self-referential idea of saying this statement is a lie but you say using numbers um in this like particularly clever way so it ends up being something where you say like this theorem can be proven with these axioms but the way that you say it is like with a number and um so it's very clever but it's it's uh it doesn't feel like the sort of thing you would naturally be asking about it's not a twin prime conjecture type thing it's it's a statement that was designed to be improvable but then a little bit later there was these um this theorem called the paris harrington uh there's harrington conjecture theorem something like that and it basically was a question that i don't know if it's the most natural thing in the world but it came out not because we were trying to come up with a self-referential thing that had this paradoxical nature just a question about um like discrete math and it turned out to have the same property it was like not it could not be proven within like the scope of certain axioms um and it was like a naturally arising example of the sort of things that girdle's theorem said must exist among any so that just shook the foundations of uh math for people even thinking that it was possible to have like the correct axiom system and from my view it kind of doesn't matter like i don't actually think that i think one of the biggest misconceptions about math is that it's about absolute truths and it's not uh like what what it actually is is a a means of connecting assumptions with results and certainly anytime you are trying to apply it you feel this very viscerally because you're like ah well we're doing these statistics and according to a normal distribution such and such should be like very unlikely and you say well normal distribution central limit theorem assumes that your things were independent were they independent you're like oh we've got to question the assumptions there's always this like this question of like were the assumptions um correct in the way that we applied it and the idea that that ends up cutting in a parallel way down to the core of pure math itself where the results are dependent on the axioms that you chose and you never have something that is a pure capital t truth it's always a path that i mean that feels more honest to me and that feels good that it mirrors the way that math ends up getting applied rather than being some completely separate type of reasoning that happens in the pure land versus in the applied land how about progress in terms our ability to teach math so this is of course something that you've been very much involved with for years even before you really started the youtube channel working at khan academy and looking at how do we train people to understand math and i think that the number of people such as myself who don't understand math as well as they should is is way too high and i worry that in math with with math in particular that if we make fundamental new discoveries say in rockets we can all sit back whether it's on twitter or whether it's on tv and we can watch a rocket soar off planet earth and then land right where it took off and it's amazing we could see the fire we can see the fuel we can see the smoke in the flames and it's grand and it's magnificent and my concern with math is like there's such a small percentage of the people on planet earth who can even appreciate what's going on at the frontier of math and that in some way that's hurting our ability to be inspired by the beauty of numbers so a couple things there um if it's bad let's just agree that it's better than it ever has been before um like the ability for people to get back into math or the resources that students have available to them um or our knowledge about what it takes for people to learn uh it's it's definitely way better than it has been before and i think this is reflected in the fact that we have many more math literates these days than even like 50 years ago even if it's not universal that's like a fact one thing that i find quite interesting sitting here in like the land of youtube and popularizing um various different scientific subjects in youtube um is to look at brady herron uh are you familiar with him i have come across him but i haven't watched any of his videos great so he he runs a number of channels one of them is called number file it's about math it's the biggest math channel australian guy australian guy yeah um he like has a background in journalism at the bbc um but he's just got like a bunch of channels in various different subjects so like periodic videos talking about chemistry and some that are talking about like physics some that are talking about computer science uh just really running running uh the gamut on like different topics in the same style which is to interview experts and then to provide a good like production quality surrounding that interview and it's good stuff now if you would ask me you know 10 years ago let's say brady's like starting these projects and you say place your bets which of these channels will be the most popular that most people want to watch and things like well definitely the physics one people seem into that and that's more tangible same things with like things like chemistry or computer science the one about numbers and math like i don't know maybe that um that'll be one of those backwater ones that is just for a specific esoteric audience in reality numberphile is the most popular by far and you know maybe that's just because the particular people that he chose to interview in the early days of numberphile just by happenstance are much more engaging than the ones that happen to interview elsewhere but i think that that actually reflects a kind of um unappreciated universality to math appeal where you have people who are interested in it um and just in a in an entertainment kind of way just wanting to ambiently learn about it by choice as they're scrolling around youtube from a lot of different backgrounds for a lot of different reasons maybe it's students maybe it's engineering nerds maybe it's like science nerds um maybe it's people who they're not even into either of those but they they just love patterns and sudoku type puzzles and whatnot like you have all these different avenues that make people interested in the subject in a way that uh like i just really like the brady hair and example because it's so viscerally visible how much more popular like the math version of this style ends up being than another one so that gives me a lot of hope for what the i don't know just what the general public interest in this circle of things is granted i think it could be a lot more and i i think we could um hope to see 50 years from now just an exponential increase in the number of people who are inspired in progress in that the same way that you just described rockets um but i think there's every reason to believe we're on that trajectory and that it'll it'll continue to grow because through things like khan academy or brilliant or all sorts of organizations out there that are aiming at having like scalable quality learning accessible to whoever wants it to be there it's it's just better than it ever like has been before yeah i'm surprised you didn't mention pop culture because i think that that's one of the the elements here and i think that this is something that you very intimately understand of how a story and conflict and and this need to know how you sort of create a question in your viewers mind and then you get to a place where the viewers like i need to know this because i'm sure that you think about oh my goodness somebody could go watch another youtube channel at any point and what i love about your channel is your i i guess this is gonna sound crass but i mean this in the best way like you're kind of just a middle finger to all the people who are like you know what people have shorter and shorter attention spans they're not willing to deal with high level content you are proving every single day in your life that that's just not true and i think of something like the three body problem a chinese science fiction novel that is based off of a super simple but super confusing and absolutely wild mathematical idea that's that's a great example um i'm right there with you on this narrative that people have shorter attention spans being um kind of bs i do think that uh yeah in some avenues this plays out this is probably why short form media like tiktok can be very addictive in a way that other things aren't but like netflix is typically quite long form especially if you consider that uh series are a longer form than movies themselves even if they come in more excuse me more bite-sized chunks and you know if you look at youtube 10 years ago versus youtube today the average video length is much longer there's much more incentive around long videos and i think that's because uh it's recognized that that's typically what a better user experience is more often than not when a video creator uh makes the claim that people have short attention spans and you got to keep it shorter it's because they don't want to make a long video like videos take a long time like you know you're sitting there on minute five you're like boy i wish i could wrap this thing up if i had to go for another 25 minutes with this level of production quality like that's just gonna eat up my month um but the one the ones who i think succeed the most are the ones where there's real depth to the explanation another if we're just gonna point to like successes of math on youtube here um i think another nice one is vsauce who has you know vegas on a number of things but he's got a ton on math and they're extremely popular and i think maybe i was looking at it the other day it's like the third most popular video on his whole channel and this is hands down one of the biggest the biggest like education channel in existence the third most popular is about the binocutarsky paradox which is a deep and not easy to explain concept in very pure math which is an idea of how if you take a sphere like a solid ball you can subdivide it into five different pieces such that when you rearrange those pieces you get two perfect copies of the same ball which seems to violate very basic things like a conservation of mass for example um but quickly realize this is because we're talking about like a very pure mathematical sphere that's not made of atoms but it's made of this uncountable infinity of like uh points of just triplets of numbers in space and how this discrepancy between modeling something as a continuum versus modeling it as like atomic allows for this very counterintuitive thing you can subdivide into five pieces rearrange those five pieces and get two identical copies of the original thing so actually explaining that is quite hard like it's um if you did it the naive way you have you have to give people this background and these things called freely generated groups and whatnot actually explaining it in a way that's substantive but doesn't require all that is even harder he does a great job and you know it's like 30 million people out there are the wiser for it because it's just this high quality explanation of a very real topic and i think it satisfied a hunger that people have to actually get the real explanation don't just give me this high level divide things give get two copies of the original like i'm here i'm waiting i've got 30 minutes to spare like explain exactly what's going on there like people are hungry for that and um i think the the video creators are rewarded when they put in the effort to satiate that hunger you're talking here about a kind of problem solving that you do where you have a starting line of this is an interesting idea that people need to know about and that i want to spend say the next two weeks to two months of my life studying and explaining to people and then you have an end goal of i need to figure out how to create a story that's both engaging compelling and that's gonna hook a reader or a viewer in and that's going to basically create an image in their brain after they watch the video that they will remember what they've seen so that's the challenge here and a couple months ago you gave some solving some some problem solving tricks you shared nine of them and two of them stuck out to me the first was leveraging symmetry and the second one was give meaningful names why are those um i guess for very different reasons so starting with the second one giving meaningful names um i cannot remember who whose quote this is maybe you can help me but it's like perhaps the organization of one's thoughts is not distinct from the content of those thoughts um and that that really strikes me as something that's kind of deep where we think of those as separate things but the mere act of organizing might be a substance of our thoughts like that there's nothing more than that it's just good organization and so naming is the first step to that it um really highlights what parts of a problem or a diagram or a set of algebraic quantities are worth highlighting and when you're asked to name them um it's kind of this forcing function to say what is meaningful about it like what is this part of the geometry problem that i'm dealing with or what is this right hand side of the equation representing all of that um so that is just like clarifies thoughts the same way that writing does you know when you're when you're forced to write an essay or write a journal entry as opposed to letting it stew around in your own head something different happens through the articulation on the symmetry front that feels like a very deep question where i honestly don't know how to answer that it's almost bizarre how when you look for something about a problem that doesn't change when you shift it in some way so symmetry is most visible in geometry but it we're not just talking about something geometric but like if you're looking at a geometric diagram and you say wow it looks the same or it has similar properties if i if i look at it from two different perspectives that lets you create things like equalities because maybe an aspect of a view for one lens is non-trivially the same as an aspect that same aspect like viewed through another lens um and that as soon as you're starting to connect things that gets you the progress towards um whatever you're trying to solve i mean like the pythagorean theorem or something like that where you want to say that a squared plus b squared is the same as c squared like you need to draw an equality in order to do that like finding two perspectives of the same thing that's kind of how that happens but i mean there's all sorts of things that are even deeper than that it's like in differential equations um often you have these results around how if you have a symmetry to your setup then you can reduce the degree of the equation for each one of those symmetries and such or the way that um groups are connected to physics you kind of have this uh it's what's known as noder's theorem that says that every symmetry to the laws of physics corresponds to a conservation law so like if if the laws of physics should be the same whether you're here or two inches to the right or five light years to the right like wherever you are spatially translated the laws of physics should be the same that ends up implying that there should be a kind of conservation of momentum and like rotational symmetry implies that there should be a conservation of angular momentum and in fact every kind of symmetry corresponds to some kind of conservation and anyone who's done any level of physics knows that conservation laws are like how you solve problems so that's like that's a particularly deep connection there i don't know if there's a good answer for like why that principle works as well as it does but it's it's worth underlining yeah i don't know if this is relevant or not but i i want to give a very biblical answer to they gave meaningful names it's probably not a coincidence that in the book of genesis god is tasked with naming things that once that to name something is to give people power i mean can you imagine and and and it is to gives to create the nature of that thing often i don't know if you've ever suffered from naming something and having other people adopt it and then actually not liking the name of what you named the idea um it's happened to me a couple times as i've taught my writing students and you can't change the name the name itself is so deeply intertwined with the idea and there's something there that how you name something just like what you said how the organization and the content are so intimately linked um i think that once you name a thing you're giving structure to that and there's this whole set of assumptions that are given when you take that action yeah yeah it's almost like if someone was dumb enough to name their youtube channel after a piece of their physical anatomy you can't change that no matter how weirdly self-centered it seems in hindsight [Laughter] that's very funny what do you think of the trade-off between productivity and distraction and i am here like we usually see distraction as something that is bad but it has actually been our friend michael nielsen who has changed my mind on this he quotes um freeman dyson talking about robert oppenheimer who says we can see the nature of the flaw which made his life ultimately tragic his flaw was restlessness an inborn inability to be idle intervals of idleness are probably essential to creative work on the highest level shakespeare we are told was habitually idle between plays oppenheimer was hardly ever idle what do you see as the role of idleness in your work oh it seems very important but that sounds like a rationalization uh i mean i i think it's worth being very conscious of the role that each play what you just said really resonates with me that you need you actually need distraction to stumble upon like new insights like have that comfort in uh just reading a book during the work day that you otherwise might not be reading or letting yourself just noodle on a piece of paper or something but it can't just be any distraction right if you're like off playing candy crush i don't think there's any way to justify that that's promoting creativity but the right kinds idleness and distraction that are not purposeful towards an a a given plan i think that's very important but at the same time at some point you gotta sit down and just get the thing done gotta get it done usually the hardest part of that process is the one is the part when you're gonna be most inclined to find yourself distracted uh you know it's you're trying to solve some little micro puzzle you're dealing with just like a really annoying sound editing task or whatever it is and you're like yeah maybe i kind of want to go read like those are the moments that maybe distraction isn't the highfalutin creative inducing thing that you want it to be and actually what it is is purely slowing you down um another mutual friend uh if i was like andy matus jack i think i remember him asking about this dichotomy between like let's say you're trying to write something whether you should be like going for a long walk and just sort of like letting things um stew versus just like gluing your butt to a chair and like typing and just not stopping and he was asking this on twitter and someone gave what i thought was just an absolutely great response there was something to the effect of what you're asking about is should i be exhaling or should i be inhaling the question is not any one of them it's like this finding the right balance between the two so in that way i think uh idleness is like inhaling and then just gluing yourself to the computer and getting stuff done is the exhaling and it's important to recognize when each one is needed yeah i don't really know but i really like your your point there about how new ideas do come in a state of distraction and i'm almost wondering if productivity is sort of optimizing the system that you already know exists whereas distraction is almost like a ran an algorithm for randomness where it just on average or your median insight or moment will be basically inconsequential but for the small percentage of things that are consequential they are the only things that can take you out of the matrix that you're locked inside of easily yeah the best projects i've ever had came from um we're born in distraction not in purposeful uh planning that that's absolutely true you have a template for your work and all your videos build upon some kind of template you must have spent a long time investing in that template how did you create that template and and and what was the thought pattern behind doing so was it all like a one big fell swoop where you're just gonna create it then you're gonna use it forever or what was behind that do i have a template i don't know if i've ever like thought about things you mean in terms of like um narrative construction or in terms of visuals or visuals you know like the little pie with the eyes you know oh yeah yeah okay so i guess i guess in that way like you know the way i do animations is a little weird it's all programmatic and what that will sometimes mean is um it's nice to leverage abstraction where if you've just got like a scene type that you just have to like tweak some attributes for that's just way easier than doing it ground up so in that way like that a default scene is the sort of teacher student thing where you've got the three blue pie creatures and the one brown one that's just yeah that's because it's it's like sitting right there as a scaffold just waiting to be filled in with content and i think that doesn't have to come from weird programmatic animation a lot of people have assets set up like that but it'll also mean that during a particular project um i might like set the infrastructure for the kind of thing that i want to animate um you know let's say it's like a four-year transform and you've got a particular visual that the whole video is meant to center around so you've got infrastructure for it and then everything is like a variant of that core uh visual type um and i think a nice side effect of that is that it gives a certain like stylistic consistency uh and then you can connect ideas through visual similarity you know this thing that we're looking at now visually looks like this thing we were looking at ten minutes ago and through you know the viewer's brain can hopefully like see a connection more readily than if it was more stylistically inconsistent um but i i don't actually think i've i've been very deliberate about establishing a template and thinking what if the what the best template is that's more an emergent phenomenon than anything deliberate do you think about building a brand at all kind of yeah i mean i do think brand is very important for just like any anyone really like that's that's one of those aspects of how you run it feels weird to call it a business but any kind of like um business or something with public presence i think it's important to think what is the emotion that this evokes when people see a few key triggers that's really what a brand is well i want like people to trust that they will come out understanding something and having a good experience like the hope is that if someone sees a thumbnail um for like a video that i do that they have uh this like they're willing to do a trust fall and they like fall back into it with the next 20 minutes of their life and um that i can like hopefully deliver what was like a meaningful experience there um that uh that it won't be shallow i guess that if there's a claim that um something will be explained that uh i don't know if i always follow through on this but the goal is that you know someone doesn't think that it'll just be like a high level surface thing that they would have been able to find elsewhere like all of that gets built in and then in order to maintain that like stylistic consistency is the other like component of branding where whether that means just like having a logo that doesn't change too much or having like uh visual schematics that identify like this channel as something different from other channels and everyone has this like everyone has their like notion of branding whether it was deliberate or not um and it i think it does matter for getting this immediate um mindset from the viewer that you want them to be in as they're starting the starting their experience when it comes to videos that you create what it what math do you find to be particularly hard is there a subsection that is easy to other people but somehow just ah and agonizing to you i i always have a hard time putting together a video about probability and i i actually don't know why um it's not it's not because the material's harder per se um i think it's just that there's like so many different ways that people seem to be coming at it from and like different priors that people have or different constructs that would be more helpful to them and there's other topics where i think okay this way viewing it pretty universally i think people will like um and just i i always have the hardest time if i'm putting another script on something about probability thinking like ah should i say it this way well someone might prefer to see it that way well it kind of depends on if they're thinking of it as someone coming in from machine learning or if they're coming in from physics or are they just thinking of like counting problems like it always um that it always has this uncomfortable multiplicity so even if the subject matter isn't like deeply challenging expositorily it's actually for me like very challenging which is why i make so many promises that i don't follow through on with respect to certain probability videos you were talking about the experience that your viewers gonna have how with probability it's hard because people comment the video from such a medley of perspectives and that leads me into my question do you consciously get feedback do you a process of getting feedback from the youtube comments do you have a process from before you publish a video like you send videos to people how do you actually develop that intuition that is so easy for a teacher who's just speaking to an audience in a classroom you can tell when jane in the back is bored or billy in the front is enthralled with what you're saying how do you build that intuition if you're creating digitally even for the teacher i think it's hard because unless you're doing something one-on-one it's hard to know let's say you can tell that a student's board it's hard to know why it might have nothing to do with your lesson it might be because they didn't get enough sleep or if it has something to do with your lesson you don't know what so i think one-on-one either conversations or sample lessons um in the ideation phase are important i always uh yeah i always feel good when i do that um the less i do it i just just do it more however much i'm doing like sample lessons preceding a video it's not enough i think um so what are those sample lessons like are they in person are they virtual talk about those in person if possible these days that's harder but even still like at the loosest it can be if you're just like chatting on the phone with um though it's harder without visual cues um yeah i've had times when i'll just have like a very basic overhead camera thing to do it virtually and like scribble something but uh what you want is to kind of explain something and then get an instinct for what excites the person what confuses them um what perspectives resonated most and just like really uh iterate based on that that's i don't think i do it enough but you know this is really interesting i think you're surprised by how i'm surprised by this but i expected the answer to be no but it's interesting because when i teach my writing students we have an acronym called crips and so in all moments of feedback everyone looks for things that are confusing repeated insightful boring and surprising and you said two of those and it just makes me think that there's something fundamental about the things that you're looking for when you're trying to teach so what you're doing when you say overhead what is like the ideal scenario that you're doing like a 20-minute explanation and what do you mean by overhead i meant much more uh uh menially than i think you thought just overhead camera while i'm doing a video call that kind of thing so that you can write down um but yeah so merely because having things that are drawn and written is much better than waving your hands in the air and asking someone to imagine yeah one of my dreams and someone's going to invent this it will be invented before i die is i would love somebody to invent a ability to map things out in 3d as you explain things because i'm very handsy when i talk because i try to sort of visualize these sort of three-dimensional construction and a lot of this idea is inspired by brett victor who i'm sure you know and trying to visualize these ideas and leads me into a next question what what do you think that you've taken from brett that's a good question uh i mean there's something to be said for unabashed optimism and like engaging with what a future should look like and feeling um uncomfortable with the norm like almost in even if that's not something that is directly applied to the same fields that he's talking about if it's interaction with computers and software just the idea that the way that things are currently should not be taken as static and it's worth thinking about like what should this be and also looking historically to say when things shifted the most um what were the personality characteristics behind the people who made it shift the way that it did right um so i remember a particularly good talk that he gave where he was uh presenting it as if it was the 1960s and he was looking at the future of programming and talking about all the exciting things happening those days from like lick lighter and like uh time sharing computing and like really re reimagining what programming should be i mean and drawing the line out and what was most like compelling about that is that he's talking about true historic things and how if you were to draw the line out it gets you like this really wonderfully inspiring landscape for what computation could be and what programming ended up being was a lot more linear than that um and so it's this reminder that like the future is ours to invent and it won't invent itself um yeah i don't know how uh directly i've ever like taken a concrete thing that he's like worked on or talked about and tried to incorporate it but maybe i should maybe i should uh dive into the uh um rabbit hole again yeah that just always leaves you more inspired than when you started you mentioned personality characteristics what do you think some of those are you you seem to have a real appreciation for the people who came before you to create these these mathematical concepts who extended the frontier of math and i think that as much as any field it requires a dogged commitment to your work and to faith that things are possible you know a lot of the people who have made mathematical progress were considered lunatics or outcasts by society and lunatics to themselves at times i can only imagine the doubt and even the self-loathing of what those people must have felt because often these problems will take 5 15 years to solve well one common misconception about mathematicians is that they're these like lone geniuses off writing soul authored papers like in their attic um and maybe this is exacerbated based on certain prominent historical figures who are not like the most social characters in the world like newton um but the reality of modern math is that it's heavily collaborative i do remember when i was i was like in high school and i was at this um like university math circles type thing where they like have a mathematician come and talk and someone just asked what is it about your job that you didn't expect that kind of surprised you about being a mathematician uh and his answer was i travel a lot more than i thought i would um because you know you're in some specific discipline and you gotta collaborate with other people and so he's just like a lot of his life has been flying off to the right people to collaborate with and um i think even now that that violates what people's image of a mathematician is that you're like seeking out the people to work with or that um and a lot of people will say like terry tau as being you know one of the best mathematicians living mathematicians in the world one thing that characterizes his work is just how how much of a social butterfly he is it's like swoops into one area helps there swoops into another helps there and it's kind of by having this super broad understanding of all the different types of math and being able to take the pieces from one and putting it into another that seems to be what makes um makes him such a valuable asset and they have all sorts of characters like paul erdish is another very classic example um of someone who was this itinerant um like if if ideas were viruses you know that we'd be describing him as like the super spreader who's like our value is through the roof so those sort of people that's a great question and i'm gonna throw it right back at you what is it about your job that you didn't expect oh well the job i guess the actual thing that i do with making videos about that you asked me like 10 years ago like what do you think you're going to be doing it's not this um that's for sure um yeah yeah the fact that anything that i do involves like kind of a like this kind of stuff right here i'm on a podcast the sort of public presence or that i'll like give public talks or um that some of the things i'll like be on camera and like having to uh think about like entertainment in that world and that that's something i just would not have expected it's not really in my personality as much um i think it took me a while to be comfortable with public speaking it takes a lot of people a while because it's just not a natural thing so that um it's fun and i like it but that was not expected or in any of the plans i had for what career trajectories were likely within mathematics what's your favorite constant pi e something like the golden ratio all of those are pretty terrible to be honest uh i'm a fan of one so uh fee everyone knows that's overrated that it's just like this source of weird numerous numerological obsession that um is not born in any actual facts you know people look at a conch shell they're like it's the golden spiral like it's actually not if you do the measurements um it's a solution to a particular quadratic it's not all that special pi very well reported you know how it's a little bit awkward that we use pi instead of tau it doesn't really matter it's just like choose your favorite circle constant and move forward with it pi's fine i guess e this one is i think heavily overrated because 01:0:0,069 --> 01:0:2,079 01:0:0,079 --> 01:0:4,160 uh what matters is the function this 01:0:2,069 --> 01:0:4,160 01:0:2,079 --> 01:0:6,000 natural like exponential function 01:0:4,150 --> 01:0:6,000 01:0:4,160 --> 01:0:7,520 and e is just the value this function 01:0:5,990 --> 01:0:7,520 01:0:6,000 --> 01:0:9,920 happens to have at one 01:0:7,510 --> 01:0:9,920 01:0:7,520 --> 01:0:11,200 um it's interesting that the value it 01:0:9,910 --> 01:0:11,200 01:0:9,920 --> 01:0:13,119 has at one 01:0:11,190 --> 01:0:13,119 01:0:11,200 --> 01:0:14,240 like can sort of carry the weight of the 01:0:13,109 --> 01:0:14,240 01:0:13,119 --> 01:0:15,839 function and thinking of repeated 01:0:14,230 --> 01:0:15,839 01:0:14,240 --> 01:0:16,480 multiplication with that value gets you 01:0:15,829 --> 01:0:16,480 01:0:15,839 --> 01:0:18,240 a long way 01:0:16,470 --> 01:0:18,240 01:0:16,480 --> 01:0:19,440 for what the function is about but it 01:0:18,230 --> 01:0:19,440 01:0:18,240 --> 01:0:20,799 doesn't get you anywhere near the full 01:0:19,430 --> 01:0:20,799 01:0:19,440 --> 01:0:22,480 breadth of what this like 01:0:20,789 --> 01:0:22,480 01:0:20,799 --> 01:0:24,240 deep exponential function does and 01:0:22,470 --> 01:0:24,240 01:0:22,480 --> 01:0:24,720 relates to and you know the first time 01:0:24,230 --> 01:0:24,720 01:0:24,240 --> 01:0:26,160 01:0:24,710 --> 01:0:26,160 01:0:24,720 --> 01:0:28,319 start to get a feeling of this is when 01:0:26,150 --> 01:0:28,319 01:0:26,160 --> 01:0:30,319 you see like e to an imaginary number 01:0:28,309 --> 01:0:30,319 01:0:28,319 --> 01:0:31,760 like that that doesn't make sense but it 01:0:30,309 --> 01:0:31,760 01:0:30,319 --> 01:0:33,359 goes beyond that you you see 01:0:31,750 --> 01:0:33,359 01:0:31,760 --> 01:0:35,040 raising e to the power of like a matrix 01:0:33,349 --> 01:0:35,040 01:0:33,359 --> 01:0:36,319 or an operator we look through like 01:0:35,030 --> 01:0:36,319 01:0:35,040 --> 01:0:37,040 quantum physics and this comes up all 01:0:36,309 --> 01:0:37,040 01:0:36,319 --> 01:0:38,480 the time 01:0:37,030 --> 01:0:38,480 01:0:37,040 --> 01:0:40,400 and it's just it actually has nothing to 01:0:38,470 --> 01:0:40,400 01:0:38,480 --> 01:0:42,000 do with the number e is the problem 01:0:40,390 --> 01:0:42,000 01:0:40,400 --> 01:0:43,359 it's like e was this numerical residue 01:0:41,990 --> 01:0:43,359 01:0:42,000 --> 01:0:45,040 of this function back in the land of 01:0:43,349 --> 01:0:45,040 01:0:43,359 --> 01:0:46,880 real numbers but it really has nothing 01:0:45,030 --> 01:0:46,880 01:0:45,040 --> 01:0:48,480 to do with what's going on there so that 01:0:46,870 --> 01:0:48,480 01:0:46,880 --> 01:0:48,960 one's not just like overrated but i 01:0:48,470 --> 01:0:48,960 01:0:48,480 --> 01:0:50,720 think 01:0:48,950 --> 01:0:50,720 01:0:48,960 --> 01:0:52,079 leads to a certain category of 01:0:50,710 --> 01:0:52,079 01:0:50,720 --> 01:0:54,799 misconceptions 01:0:52,069 --> 01:0:54,799 01:0:52,079 --> 01:0:55,680 um so yeah as far as like constants go 01:0:54,789 --> 01:0:55,680 01:0:54,799 --> 01:0:58,000 01:0:55,670 --> 01:0:58,000 01:0:55,680 --> 01:0:59,599 one you really can't beat one 01:0:57,990 --> 01:0:59,599 01:0:58,000 --> 01:1:1,200 multiplicative identity 01:0:59,589 --> 01:1:1,200 01:0:59,599 --> 01:1:2,720 you keep adding it to itself and you get 01:1:1,190 --> 01:1:2,720 01:1:1,200 --> 01:1:4,559 all the natural numbers 01:1:2,710 --> 01:1:4,559 01:1:2,720 --> 01:1:6,319 um it's this nice like reduction 01:1:4,549 --> 01:1:6,319 01:1:4,559 --> 01:1:9,280 homeland point 01:1:6,309 --> 01:1:9,280 01:1:6,319 --> 01:1:10,000 and just because it's uh it's popular 01:1:9,270 --> 01:1:10,000 01:1:9,280 --> 01:1:11,599 doesn't mean it's 01:1:9,990 --> 01:1:11,599 01:1:10,000 --> 01:1:12,960 it doesn't deserve it it's not even 01:1:11,589 --> 01:1:12,960 01:1:11,599 --> 01:1:14,400 popular just because it's well known 01:1:12,950 --> 01:1:14,400 01:1:12,960 --> 01:1:16,880 doesn't mean it deserves 01:1:14,390 --> 01:1:16,880 01:1:14,400 --> 01:1:18,559 uh you know all of our respect and love 01:1:16,870 --> 01:1:18,559 01:1:16,880 --> 01:1:20,480 well if it's a stock 01:1:18,549 --> 01:1:20,480 01:1:18,559 --> 01:1:22,160 why is it an undervalued stock what is 01:1:20,470 --> 01:1:22,160 01:1:20,480 --> 01:1:24,319 it about the nature of 01:1:22,150 --> 01:1:24,319 01:1:22,160 --> 01:1:26,319 one that makes it undervalued i saw a 01:1:24,309 --> 01:1:26,319 01:1:24,319 --> 01:1:29,359 book recently called zero 01:1:26,309 --> 01:1:29,359 01:1:26,319 --> 01:1:31,200 that came out what's going on with one 01:1:29,349 --> 01:1:31,200 01:1:29,359 --> 01:1:33,119 if it's undervalued it's because it's 01:1:31,190 --> 01:1:33,119 01:1:31,200 --> 01:1:36,160 like one of those backbone 01:1:33,109 --> 01:1:36,160 01:1:33,119 --> 01:1:38,640 core of the economy unsexy data 01:1:36,150 --> 01:1:38,640 01:1:36,160 --> 01:1:40,799 aggregating kind of companies yeah right 01:1:38,630 --> 01:1:40,799 01:1:38,640 --> 01:1:42,160 it's like it's not the snapchat with the 01:1:40,789 --> 01:1:42,160 01:1:40,799 --> 01:1:45,520 meteoric rise 01:1:42,150 --> 01:1:45,520 01:1:42,160 --> 01:1:47,200 it's not like um the the social media 01:1:45,510 --> 01:1:47,200 01:1:45,520 --> 01:1:48,400 companies of any kind that's like on the 01:1:47,190 --> 01:1:48,400 01:1:47,200 --> 01:1:49,440 top of your mind because you're a 01:1:48,390 --> 01:1:49,440 01:1:48,400 --> 01:1:52,640 consumer 01:1:49,430 --> 01:1:52,640 01:1:49,440 --> 01:1:54,000 it's instead like laying the fiber 01:1:52,630 --> 01:1:54,000 01:1:52,640 --> 01:1:55,760 or something that like you just don't 01:1:53,990 --> 01:1:55,760 01:1:54,000 --> 01:1:57,920 necessarily think about or 01:1:55,750 --> 01:1:57,920 01:1:55,760 --> 01:1:59,680 um it's like providing oil drilling 01:1:57,910 --> 01:1:59,680 01:1:57,920 --> 01:2:2,640 equipment um 01:1:59,670 --> 01:2:2,640 01:1:59,680 --> 01:2:3,200 it's it's core it's like incredibly 01:2:2,630 --> 01:2:3,200 01:2:2,640 --> 01:2:4,559 valuable 01:2:3,190 --> 01:2:4,559 01:2:3,200 --> 01:2:6,400 it's not that people don't think it's 01:2:4,549 --> 01:2:6,400 01:2:4,559 --> 01:2:8,720 there it's just that 01:2:6,390 --> 01:2:8,720 01:2:6,400 --> 01:2:11,200 you know it it's not attracting the same 01:2:8,710 --> 01:2:11,200 01:2:8,720 --> 01:2:13,039 love that some of the other 01:2:11,190 --> 01:2:13,039 01:2:11,200 --> 01:2:16,000 pop stars of the real number line around 01:2:13,029 --> 01:2:16,000 01:2:13,039 --> 01:2:19,200 it are attracting 01:2:15,990 --> 01:2:19,200 01:2:16,000 --> 01:2:21,119 you mentioned writing scripts a little 01:2:19,190 --> 01:2:21,119 01:2:19,200 --> 01:2:22,480 while ago and i didn't want to let go of 01:2:21,109 --> 01:2:22,480 01:2:21,119 --> 01:2:25,760 that threat so you have 01:2:22,470 --> 01:2:25,760 01:2:22,480 --> 01:2:26,319 two kinds of videos problem solving 01:2:25,750 --> 01:2:26,319 01:2:25,760 --> 01:2:29,359 videos 01:2:26,309 --> 01:2:29,359 01:2:26,319 --> 01:2:31,920 and expository videos how is 01:2:29,349 --> 01:2:31,920 01:2:29,359 --> 01:2:33,520 your script writing process different 01:2:31,910 --> 01:2:33,520 01:2:31,920 --> 01:2:35,920 for both of those 01:2:33,510 --> 01:2:35,920 01:2:33,520 --> 01:2:37,200 the level of pain for sure yeah 01:2:35,910 --> 01:2:37,200 01:2:35,920 --> 01:2:38,799 problem-solving videos are 01:2:37,190 --> 01:2:38,799 01:2:37,200 --> 01:2:40,000 the most fun to write and they write 01:2:38,789 --> 01:2:40,000 01:2:38,799 --> 01:2:40,319 themselves because you know the end 01:2:39,990 --> 01:2:40,319 01:2:40,000 --> 01:2:41,520 point 01:2:40,309 --> 01:2:41,520 01:2:40,319 --> 01:2:43,760 you know the start point so you just 01:2:41,510 --> 01:2:43,760 01:2:41,520 --> 01:2:44,480 have to like draw a verbal line between 01:2:43,750 --> 01:2:44,480 01:2:43,760 --> 01:2:46,960 the two 01:2:44,470 --> 01:2:46,960 01:2:44,480 --> 01:2:48,640 uh expository videos it's like what is 01:2:46,950 --> 01:2:48,640 01:2:46,960 --> 01:2:50,079 the end point here and what is the start 01:2:48,630 --> 01:2:50,079 01:2:48,640 --> 01:2:51,680 point what do people know about this 01:2:50,069 --> 01:2:51,680 01:2:50,079 --> 01:2:52,240 topic and like what are we trying to say 01:2:51,670 --> 01:2:52,240 01:2:51,680 --> 01:2:54,720 01:2:52,230 --> 01:2:54,720 01:2:52,240 --> 01:2:56,319 uh what are the not the perspectives 01:2:54,710 --> 01:2:56,319 01:2:54,720 --> 01:2:58,079 that i can try to provide around it that 01:2:56,309 --> 01:2:58,079 01:2:56,319 --> 01:3:2,880 like wouldn't be found in other 01:2:58,069 --> 01:3:2,880 01:2:58,079 --> 01:3:5,280 expository works on this um yeah so that 01:3:2,870 --> 01:3:5,280 01:3:2,880 --> 01:3:6,559 it's almost always um problem solving 01:3:5,270 --> 01:3:6,559 01:3:5,280 --> 01:3:9,119 sorry the expository one 01:3:6,549 --> 01:3:9,119 01:3:6,559 --> 01:3:10,720 where i will try to if i am on top of my 01:3:9,109 --> 01:3:10,720 01:3:9,119 --> 01:3:12,240 game we'll try to do sample lessons 01:3:10,710 --> 01:3:12,240 01:3:10,720 --> 01:3:15,359 because that's where it's valuable 01:3:12,230 --> 01:3:15,359 01:3:12,240 --> 01:3:16,640 actually yeah i i probably almost never 01:3:15,349 --> 01:3:16,640 01:3:15,359 --> 01:3:18,720 actually do a sample lesson on problem 01:3:16,630 --> 01:3:18,720 01:3:16,640 --> 01:3:21,200 solving once i just sort of 01:3:18,710 --> 01:3:21,200 01:3:18,720 --> 01:3:22,559 it's like maybe i should that might 01:3:21,190 --> 01:3:22,559 01:3:21,200 --> 01:3:24,559 actually make it better but 01:3:22,549 --> 01:3:24,559 01:3:22,559 --> 01:3:26,640 it sort of feels a lot easier to know 01:3:24,549 --> 01:3:26,640 01:3:24,559 --> 01:3:27,839 where everyone is because 01:3:26,630 --> 01:3:27,839 01:3:26,640 --> 01:3:30,079 basically because you're bringing in 01:3:27,829 --> 01:3:30,079 01:3:27,839 --> 01:3:33,200 something without any priors it's like 01:3:30,069 --> 01:3:33,200 01:3:30,079 --> 01:3:35,440 um if i ask this question that's like 01:3:33,190 --> 01:3:35,440 01:3:33,200 --> 01:3:37,440 you know a probability question on a 01:3:35,430 --> 01:3:37,440 01:3:35,440 --> 01:3:38,720 certain geometric setup 01:3:37,430 --> 01:3:38,720 01:3:37,440 --> 01:3:41,200 you didn't come in with pre-existing 01:3:38,710 --> 01:3:41,200 01:3:38,720 --> 01:3:43,039 assumptions you you just came in because 01:3:41,190 --> 01:3:43,039 01:3:41,200 --> 01:3:44,720 like um you're at the same point 01:3:43,029 --> 01:3:44,720 01:3:43,039 --> 01:3:46,079 everyone else is the challenge that that 01:3:44,710 --> 01:3:46,079 01:3:44,720 --> 01:3:47,280 brings is that i didn't have to motivate 01:3:46,069 --> 01:3:47,280 01:3:46,079 --> 01:3:48,240 like why we should care about this 01:3:47,270 --> 01:3:48,240 01:3:47,280 --> 01:3:50,319 random puzzle 01:3:48,230 --> 01:3:50,319 01:3:48,240 --> 01:3:51,839 um so maybe that's a little bit harder 01:3:50,309 --> 01:3:51,839 01:3:50,319 --> 01:3:53,760 whereas exposition 01:3:51,829 --> 01:3:53,760 01:3:51,839 --> 01:3:54,960 ones the motivation comes pre-baked like 01:3:53,750 --> 01:3:54,960 01:3:53,760 --> 01:3:56,000 i don't need to tell you to care about 01:3:54,950 --> 01:3:56,000 01:3:54,960 --> 01:3:58,400 neural networks 01:3:55,990 --> 01:3:58,400 01:3:56,000 --> 01:3:59,920 uh we can just dive right in whereas if 01:3:58,390 --> 01:3:59,920 01:3:58,400 --> 01:4:2,319 i ask you 01:3:59,910 --> 01:4:2,319 01:3:59,920 --> 01:4:3,440 hey i um if i choose a random 01:4:2,309 --> 01:4:3,440 01:4:2,319 --> 01:4:6,480 semi-circle 01:4:3,430 --> 01:4:6,480 01:4:3,440 --> 01:4:7,359 on a disk like on a circle and i keep 01:4:6,470 --> 01:4:7,359 01:4:6,480 --> 01:4:8,880 doing that 01:4:7,349 --> 01:4:8,880 01:4:7,359 --> 01:4:10,240 you know and i count how many times does 01:4:8,870 --> 01:4:10,240 01:4:8,880 --> 01:4:10,960 it take before the whole circle is 01:4:10,230 --> 01:4:10,960 01:4:10,240 --> 01:4:12,880 covered 01:4:10,950 --> 01:4:12,880 01:4:10,960 --> 01:4:15,039 or i'm doing it with uniform probability 01:4:12,870 --> 01:4:15,039 01:4:12,880 --> 01:4:17,760 like what's the expected number of times 01:4:15,029 --> 01:4:17,760 01:4:15,039 --> 01:4:19,119 um that's a fun puzzle i think it's fun 01:4:17,750 --> 01:4:19,119 01:4:17,760 --> 01:4:22,400 it's going to be a fun 01:4:19,109 --> 01:4:22,400 01:4:19,119 --> 01:4:23,680 process to explain why it works because 01:4:22,390 --> 01:4:23,680 01:4:22,400 --> 01:4:26,160 there's like a very clever insight that 01:4:23,670 --> 01:4:26,160 01:4:23,680 --> 01:4:27,520 will be involved but ah there's not a 01:4:26,150 --> 01:4:27,520 01:4:26,160 --> 01:4:29,440 great way to hook you into that because 01:4:27,510 --> 01:4:29,440 01:4:27,520 --> 01:4:30,480 it's not 01:4:29,430 --> 01:4:30,480 01:4:29,440 --> 01:4:32,240 that's what we were talking about 01:4:30,470 --> 01:4:32,240 01:4:30,480 --> 01:4:33,839 earlier it doesn't have boots on the 01:4:32,230 --> 01:4:33,839 01:4:32,240 --> 01:4:35,920 ground for touching reality 01:4:33,829 --> 01:4:35,920 01:4:33,839 --> 01:4:38,400 so i would happily make a video on that 01:4:35,910 --> 01:4:38,400 01:4:35,920 --> 01:4:40,880 problem as soon as i have a good hook 01:4:38,390 --> 01:4:40,880 01:4:38,400 --> 01:4:42,319 but until then it just has to kind of 01:4:40,870 --> 01:4:42,319 01:4:40,880 --> 01:4:43,440 sit there as the script that will be 01:4:42,309 --> 01:4:43,440 01:4:42,319 --> 01:4:46,480 easy to write one day 01:4:43,430 --> 01:4:46,480 01:4:43,440 --> 01:4:49,839 as soon as it has a title interesting 01:4:46,470 --> 01:4:49,839 01:4:46,480 --> 01:4:51,200 so there's 01:4:49,829 --> 01:4:51,200 01:4:49,839 --> 01:4:53,599 something that you said there that i 01:4:51,190 --> 01:4:53,599 01:4:51,200 --> 01:4:56,160 think that you implied that 01:4:53,589 --> 01:4:56,160 01:4:53,599 --> 01:4:57,280 maybe you have ideas that you're just 01:4:56,150 --> 01:4:57,280 01:4:56,160 --> 01:4:59,839 waiting 01:4:57,270 --> 01:4:59,839 01:4:57,280 --> 01:5:2,400 to talk about until you have a hook do 01:4:59,829 --> 01:5:2,400 01:4:59,839 --> 01:5:6,079 you ever have a hook without an idea 01:5:2,390 --> 01:5:6,079 01:5:2,400 --> 01:5:10,480 well that's a good question um 01:5:6,069 --> 01:5:10,480 01:5:6,079 --> 01:5:10,480 none that i feel proud of i guess uh 01:5:11,750 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:5:11,760 --> 01:5:14,799 well oh there was some like shameless 01:5:13,270 --> 01:5:14,799 01:5:13,280 --> 01:5:17,680 clickbaity thing i was thinking of 01:5:14,789 --> 01:5:17,680 01:5:14,799 --> 01:5:22,880 before they could make like a nice 01:5:17,670 --> 01:5:22,880 01:5:17,680 --> 01:5:24,319 uh no yeah none that i feel proud of 01:5:22,870 --> 01:5:24,319 01:5:22,880 --> 01:5:25,760 i can't think of anything because 01:5:24,309 --> 01:5:25,760 01:5:24,319 --> 01:5:27,039 usually if you have like a hook it's 01:5:25,750 --> 01:5:27,039 01:5:25,760 --> 01:5:28,240 because you have some sense of what 01:5:27,029 --> 01:5:28,240 01:5:27,039 --> 01:5:29,440 you're hooking someone into 01:5:28,230 --> 01:5:29,440 01:5:28,240 --> 01:5:31,680 so the only thing i can think that was 01:5:29,430 --> 01:5:31,680 01:5:29,440 --> 01:5:33,200 like truly without substance 01:5:31,670 --> 01:5:33,200 01:5:31,680 --> 01:5:35,440 like man if you had a video that just 01:5:33,190 --> 01:5:35,440 01:5:33,200 --> 01:5:36,720 said do not click this video 01:5:35,430 --> 01:5:36,720 01:5:35,440 --> 01:5:38,720 how many people would click it and then 01:5:36,710 --> 01:5:38,720 01:5:36,720 --> 01:5:40,480 like what sort of like 01:5:38,710 --> 01:5:40,480 01:5:38,720 --> 01:5:42,480 sociological narrative could you put 01:5:40,470 --> 01:5:42,480 01:5:40,480 --> 01:5:44,000 around that to like fill it with content 01:5:42,470 --> 01:5:44,000 01:5:42,480 --> 01:5:46,559 well there's nothing there that's just 01:5:43,990 --> 01:5:46,559 01:5:44,000 --> 01:5:48,000 like to make such a video 01:5:46,549 --> 01:5:48,000 01:5:46,559 --> 01:5:49,680 would be nothing but clickbait at that 01:5:47,990 --> 01:5:49,680 01:5:48,000 --> 01:5:52,799 01:5:49,670 --> 01:5:52,799 01:5:49,680 --> 01:5:56,400 well one of the 01:5:52,789 --> 01:5:56,400 01:5:52,799 --> 01:5:56,880 things that i think you and i both agree 01:5:56,390 --> 01:5:56,880 01:5:56,400 --> 01:6:0,960 on 01:5:56,870 --> 01:6:0,960 01:5:56,880 --> 01:6:2,400 is you don't want to start a video 01:6:0,950 --> 01:6:2,400 01:6:0,960 --> 01:6:4,480 right at the beginning of your research 01:6:2,390 --> 01:6:4,480 01:6:2,400 --> 01:6:6,559 process you know like there's a 01:6:4,470 --> 01:6:6,559 01:6:4,480 --> 01:6:8,400 idea that's kind of ingrained in school 01:6:6,549 --> 01:6:8,400 01:6:6,559 --> 01:6:11,520 it's like okay welcome to 01:6:8,390 --> 01:6:11,520 01:6:8,400 --> 01:6:14,720 u.s history class at 01:6:11,510 --> 01:6:14,720 01:6:11,520 --> 01:6:16,960 the end of the semester you're going to 01:6:14,710 --> 01:6:16,960 01:6:14,720 --> 01:6:19,359 write a paper on the civil war 01:6:16,950 --> 01:6:19,359 01:6:16,960 --> 01:6:20,559 so now is time to start researching and 01:6:19,349 --> 01:6:20,559 01:6:19,359 --> 01:6:23,039 then you know exactly you're going to 01:6:20,549 --> 01:6:23,039 01:6:20,559 --> 01:6:26,079 write your research research research 01:6:23,029 --> 01:6:26,079 01:6:23,039 --> 01:6:29,119 but that's actually tremendously costly 01:6:26,069 --> 01:6:29,119 01:6:26,079 --> 01:6:30,319 what's better to do is to the word that 01:6:29,109 --> 01:6:30,319 01:6:29,119 --> 01:6:33,440 you used was 01:6:30,309 --> 01:6:33,440 01:6:30,319 --> 01:6:34,240 ambient research and you exist in this 01:6:33,430 --> 01:6:34,240 01:6:33,440 --> 01:6:36,799 state where 01:6:34,230 --> 01:6:36,799 01:6:34,240 --> 01:6:38,319 you're just interested in math and 01:6:36,789 --> 01:6:38,319 01:6:36,799 --> 01:6:40,319 through that process 01:6:38,309 --> 01:6:40,319 01:6:38,319 --> 01:6:42,240 you're realizi you're researching a lot 01:6:40,309 --> 01:6:42,240 01:6:40,319 --> 01:6:43,920 of things without even knowing it and 01:6:42,230 --> 01:6:43,920 01:6:42,240 --> 01:6:46,559 then one day 01:6:43,910 --> 01:6:46,559 01:6:43,920 --> 01:6:47,680 well you find your hook and it all comes 01:6:46,549 --> 01:6:47,680 01:6:46,559 --> 01:6:50,079 together 01:6:47,670 --> 01:6:50,079 01:6:47,680 --> 01:6:52,319 and now it's time to make the video what 01:6:50,069 --> 01:6:52,319 01:6:50,079 --> 01:6:53,520 is that process like for you 01:6:52,309 --> 01:6:53,520 01:6:52,319 --> 01:6:56,400 it's exactly what we were talking about 01:6:53,510 --> 01:6:56,400 01:6:53,520 --> 01:6:58,240 earlier where that's why idleness 01:6:56,390 --> 01:6:58,240 01:6:56,400 --> 01:6:59,599 and distraction are valuable it's 01:6:58,230 --> 01:6:59,599 01:6:58,240 --> 01:7:2,319 because those are like 01:6:59,589 --> 01:7:2,319 01:6:59,599 --> 01:7:3,680 in a sense the ambient research phase um 01:7:2,309 --> 01:7:3,680 01:7:2,319 --> 01:7:6,000 so it looks like uh 01:7:3,670 --> 01:7:6,000 01:7:3,680 --> 01:7:7,359 just reading books or being willing to 01:7:5,990 --> 01:7:7,359 01:7:6,000 --> 01:7:9,680 get caught into a rabbit hole of an 01:7:7,349 --> 01:7:9,680 01:7:7,359 --> 01:7:12,079 interesting question 01:7:9,670 --> 01:7:12,079 01:7:9,680 --> 01:7:13,119 and like not feeling guilty about part 01:7:12,069 --> 01:7:13,119 01:7:12,079 --> 01:7:15,440 of the day 01:7:13,109 --> 01:7:15,440 01:7:13,119 --> 01:7:16,640 washing away to that effect and then 01:7:15,430 --> 01:7:16,640 01:7:15,440 --> 01:7:18,960 just keeping notes 01:7:16,630 --> 01:7:18,960 01:7:16,640 --> 01:7:20,480 and having a spot that i can turn to on 01:7:18,950 --> 01:7:20,480 01:7:18,960 --> 01:7:23,200 those notes at some point 01:7:20,470 --> 01:7:23,200 01:7:20,480 --> 01:7:24,640 um it's like kind of as simple as that 01:7:23,190 --> 01:7:24,640 01:7:23,200 --> 01:7:26,480 and very often if you were to actually 01:7:24,630 --> 01:7:26,480 01:7:24,640 --> 01:7:27,200 track like where an idea came from for a 01:7:26,470 --> 01:7:27,200 01:7:26,480 --> 01:7:29,200 video 01:7:27,190 --> 01:7:29,200 01:7:27,200 --> 01:7:31,119 like the seeds of it said like years 01:7:29,190 --> 01:7:31,119 01:7:29,200 --> 01:7:32,720 before the the production process 01:7:31,109 --> 01:7:32,720 01:7:31,119 --> 01:7:36,160 started 01:7:32,710 --> 01:7:36,160 01:7:32,720 --> 01:7:39,280 what do those notes look like oh 01:7:36,150 --> 01:7:39,280 01:7:36,160 --> 01:7:41,039 i mean sometimes it's like literal um 01:7:39,270 --> 01:7:41,039 01:7:39,280 --> 01:7:42,960 like pad of paper and pencil just like 01:7:41,029 --> 01:7:42,960 01:7:41,039 --> 01:7:45,839 scrapped at the side of the computer 01:7:42,950 --> 01:7:45,839 01:7:42,960 --> 01:7:47,359 um sometimes it's just like a text 01:7:45,829 --> 01:7:47,359 01:7:45,839 --> 01:7:48,720 editor document that's open while i'm 01:7:47,349 --> 01:7:48,720 01:7:47,359 --> 01:7:50,559 reading something 01:7:48,710 --> 01:7:50,559 01:7:48,720 --> 01:7:52,079 uh it's it's it's probably not as 01:7:50,549 --> 01:7:52,079 01:7:50,559 --> 01:7:54,000 organized as it should i've got like a 01:7:52,069 --> 01:7:54,000 01:7:52,079 --> 01:7:55,599 long asana list of like potential video 01:7:53,990 --> 01:7:55,599 01:7:54,000 --> 01:7:57,599 topics in like the detail 01:7:55,589 --> 01:7:57,599 01:7:55,599 --> 01:7:58,640 section of each one will have a little 01:7:57,589 --> 01:7:58,640 01:7:57,599 --> 01:8:1,520 scrapped um 01:7:58,630 --> 01:8:1,520 01:7:58,640 --> 01:8:2,400 like bullet point uh of important points 01:8:1,510 --> 01:8:2,400 01:8:1,520 --> 01:8:3,920 01:8:2,390 --> 01:8:3,920 01:8:2,400 --> 01:8:6,960 yeah it's it's honestly not terribly 01:8:3,910 --> 01:8:6,960 01:8:3,920 --> 01:8:8,960 organized if i if i'm like open with you 01:8:6,950 --> 01:8:8,960 01:8:6,960 --> 01:8:10,400 what percentage of your notes are 01:8:8,950 --> 01:8:10,400 01:8:8,960 --> 01:8:13,680 drawings and 01:8:10,390 --> 01:8:13,680 01:8:10,400 --> 01:8:17,839 visual versus text and 01:8:13,670 --> 01:8:17,839 01:8:13,680 --> 01:8:20,319 more logical honestly actually a lot 01:8:17,829 --> 01:8:20,319 01:8:17,839 --> 01:8:21,040 a lot more logical than like text um i 01:8:20,309 --> 01:8:21,040 01:8:20,319 --> 01:8:22,640 01:8:21,030 --> 01:8:22,640 01:8:21,040 --> 01:8:24,159 there's like isolated different i'm just 01:8:22,630 --> 01:8:24,159 01:8:22,640 --> 01:8:24,719 like calling for my notebook now i guess 01:8:24,149 --> 01:8:24,719 01:8:24,159 --> 01:8:28,000 i guess 01:8:24,709 --> 01:8:28,000 01:8:24,719 --> 01:8:30,960 drawings i guess maybe like 01:8:27,990 --> 01:8:30,960 01:8:28,000 --> 01:8:32,239 on the pen and paper it's like 50 things 01:8:30,950 --> 01:8:32,239 01:8:30,960 --> 01:8:33,040 that are like sketched in drawings but 01:8:32,229 --> 01:8:33,040 01:8:32,239 --> 01:8:34,560 then a lot 01:8:33,030 --> 01:8:34,560 01:8:33,040 --> 01:8:36,159 like that's where you'll maybe like work 01:8:34,550 --> 01:8:36,159 01:8:34,560 --> 01:8:37,440 something out and so often if you like 01:8:36,149 --> 01:8:37,440 01:8:36,159 --> 01:8:38,719 let's say you want to find an intuitive 01:8:37,430 --> 01:8:38,719 01:8:37,440 --> 01:8:40,960 explanation of something in that 01:8:38,709 --> 01:8:40,960 01:8:38,719 --> 01:8:43,040 often the first step is to like actually 01:8:40,950 --> 01:8:43,040 01:8:40,960 --> 01:8:46,080 go through the non-intuitive explanation 01:8:43,030 --> 01:8:46,080 01:8:43,040 --> 01:8:46,719 um like the most recent thing that's 01:8:46,070 --> 01:8:46,719 01:8:46,080 --> 01:8:48,799 sitting 01:8:46,709 --> 01:8:48,799 01:8:46,719 --> 01:8:50,000 in front of me here is like trying to 01:8:48,789 --> 01:8:50,000 01:8:48,799 --> 01:8:53,520 understand 01:8:49,990 --> 01:8:53,520 01:8:50,000 --> 01:8:55,359 why um like a binomial distribution 01:8:53,510 --> 01:8:55,359 01:8:53,520 --> 01:8:56,880 tends to look like a gaussian with large 01:8:55,349 --> 01:8:56,880 01:8:55,359 --> 01:8:59,520 numbers and just kind of like 01:8:56,870 --> 01:8:59,520 01:8:56,880 --> 01:9:1,199 working out um how sterling's 01:8:59,510 --> 01:9:1,199 01:8:59,520 --> 01:9:1,679 approximation on factorials like makes 01:9:1,189 --> 01:9:1,679 01:9:1,199 --> 01:9:2,960 that pop 01:9:1,669 --> 01:9:2,960 01:9:1,679 --> 01:9:4,880 out and if there's an elegant way that 01:9:2,950 --> 01:9:4,880 01:9:2,960 --> 01:9:7,040 it does and 01:9:4,870 --> 01:9:7,040 01:9:4,880 --> 01:9:8,400 in that case i guess the central 01:9:7,030 --> 01:9:8,400 01:9:7,040 --> 01:9:9,839 question in mind after doing that is to 01:9:8,390 --> 01:9:9,839 01:9:8,400 --> 01:9:10,799 like look at the algebra and say are 01:9:9,829 --> 01:9:10,799 01:9:9,839 --> 01:9:13,679 there parts of this 01:9:10,789 --> 01:9:13,679 01:9:10,799 --> 01:9:15,359 that felt like they must be true um in a 01:9:13,669 --> 01:9:15,359 01:9:13,679 --> 01:9:16,960 way that could be like visual or could 01:9:15,349 --> 01:9:16,960 01:9:15,359 --> 01:9:19,199 be better motivated or 01:9:16,950 --> 01:9:19,199 01:9:16,960 --> 01:9:20,480 something like that i don't think this 01:9:19,189 --> 01:9:20,480 01:9:19,199 --> 01:9:21,279 particular page would ever like turn 01:9:20,470 --> 01:9:21,279 01:9:20,480 --> 01:9:24,880 into a video 01:9:21,269 --> 01:9:24,880 01:9:21,279 --> 01:9:26,799 um but that's um 01:9:24,870 --> 01:9:26,799 01:9:24,880 --> 01:9:28,080 yeah that's i think kind of a valuable 01:9:26,789 --> 01:9:28,080 01:9:26,799 --> 01:9:29,679 thing to do is to just like get into the 01:9:28,070 --> 01:9:29,679 01:9:28,080 --> 01:9:31,359 nitty-gritty of like working it out in 01:9:29,669 --> 01:9:31,359 01:9:29,679 --> 01:9:33,359 like the boring algebraic way 01:9:31,349 --> 01:9:33,359 01:9:31,359 --> 01:9:36,719 so that you can assess like does it have 01:9:33,349 --> 01:9:36,719 01:9:33,359 --> 01:9:39,199 to be as boring as it as it seems 01:9:36,709 --> 01:9:39,199 01:9:36,719 --> 01:9:40,159 say that you have a seesaw of 01:9:39,189 --> 01:9:40,159 01:9:39,199 --> 01:9:43,759 universities 01:9:40,149 --> 01:9:43,759 01:9:40,159 --> 01:9:45,920 beginning to struggle and 01:9:43,749 --> 01:9:45,920 01:9:43,759 --> 01:9:46,880 they lose funding for mathematics 01:9:45,910 --> 01:9:46,880 01:9:45,920 --> 01:9:50,560 departments 01:9:46,870 --> 01:9:50,560 01:9:46,880 --> 01:9:53,920 and so on one end what's going down is 01:9:50,550 --> 01:9:53,920 01:9:50,560 --> 01:9:54,480 the ability for professors to wander 01:9:53,910 --> 01:9:54,480 01:9:53,920 --> 01:9:57,679 into 01:9:54,470 --> 01:9:57,679 01:9:54,480 --> 01:10:0,960 what you could call masturbation and to 01:9:57,669 --> 01:10:0,960 01:9:57,679 --> 01:10:3,760 spend time there and to just sort of think outside of the blue and spend time at these highfalutin to abstract ideas but what you have on the flip side is the ability for people like you to use youtube and use the internet to share ideas and to have a business model that you're actually more in control of what do you hurts mathematics with that outcome and what helps well yeah i mean i guess what you want is something that is um stable and scalable for all of the like the good thinkers out there um and the university system it's a little bit awkward this notion that the value kind of really comes from the teaching and printing of degrees uh kind of from the research too but like that it's heavily leaning on um like pumping undergrads through it i there's a part of me that kind of hopes that industrial research um fills that void a little bit more i it's healthy to have people who are otherwise very theoretical have a forcing function to make it applied and if the way that the pure mathematician spends his time it's not just like the ambient thinking about stuff isn't teaching undergrads but it's like working with professionals to try to like apply um his material that actually seems pretty healthy for math as a whole um although of course like asking yourself to teach something is a great way to come to new ways of understanding it but the problem with that is it um it will let you get more and more distant from what matters like if you actually experience an undergrad education in math uh it's not uh it's not at all clear how any of the stuff is used or like why the constructs are defined the way that they are um it's not it's not terribly motivated in a way that it could be and i think that might be coming about because the people who are putting together the curricula and the books and like teaching it the rest of their time is also so like high up in the clouds and the act of like teaching undergrads still remains in the clouds and it's not what you describe as boots on the ground but at the same time i just don't know how like scalable the idea of pure math research through industrial labs like actually is and how much value there is because it seemed like it took something very exceptional like bell labs with like this government sanctioned monopoly in order for anything like that to actually exist um and we kind of see pockets of it these days but usually it's like statistics and machine learning research in disguise it's not really like pure theorizing it feels like statistics is really like to go back to the stock it feels like a momentum stock like it feels like it's gaining a lot of value and popularity very fast as opposed to say something like calculus like in my own life i come across the cutting edge of statistics way more than calculus and those were the two higher level maths that i took at the end of high school why do you think that is well i mean calculus seems to have this role in the current education system based on what engineering used to be um which is much more heavily uh into like electrical engineering mechanical engineering very like physics-based topics where the more physics-based it is it makes sense to have a strong foundation in calculus whereas the more data driven it is then you know by its very nature that's more statistical um so a lot of people will say that we should we should push down the emphasis on calculus so as to bring up the emphasis on statistics it's not really an either or i mean a lot of a lot of actual stats you do need to have some good basic calculus in order to grasp it just like calculus is fundamental for anything as soon as you're dealing with a continuum um but that yeah it seems to be a reflection of what engineering looks like um today versus a century ago and how slow-moving changes in education are you mention data and that sort of leads me into just cutting edge technologies you know if you make the assertion which i think is generally true that one way to almost guarantee progress in a field is to create some kind of collision where you have the intersection of two different fields and it seems like right now one of the things that we're going to end up with is the intersection of a lot of computing power with mathematics what do you think the implications of that are do you mean um implications for pure math research or do you mean how pure math gets applied to this data analytics the the first one for pure math research yeah so i mean i actually don't know a ton about this but it is the case that the field of like proof checking and writing basically like programming languages to formalize math such that you could write your proof in this language and have it automatically checked that is growing and seems to be thriving and i think can have pretty big implications because um certainly if you get it to the point where you can like actually democratize the writing of a theorem in a way that's checked automatically uh you kind of solve the crank problem which is that if you have someone from outside academia who like writes in claiming to have a new math result it's almost always the case that they don't and they just don't appreciate the nuances of like why a given problem is hard this is this is the sour side actually of what you open this whole podcast with questions about prime numbers and good unsolved problems is that as inspiring as they are what they end up attracting is a ton of um just like um the the common word to use is crank crank papers that are just uh attempts to prove it that um are a lot less sophisticated than what would be needed to solve it and it's kind of a sad situation because at the same time every now and then there is someone from outside academia who does have a meaningful result and you don't want to just like cast all of these out you don't want to be uninspiring um but in a world where everything's so uh rigorously programmable that you can just say oh yeah as soon as you like submit the proof and lead and the proof checker um verifies it then yeah we'll like give it attention and like maybe invite you over then you would just have this like automated non-personal process by which all of the cranks can like see that oh this is where the fault of the proof lay and where people who aren't cranks and actually have like something to offer like actually have a chance but i think the the uh meaning meaningful value that will come from like proof checking extends a lot beyond just like the crank problem it's um it's kind of setting things on a more formal foundation it's uh it's bringing in like artificial intelligence tactics to help find new proofs or new potential avenues towards something um i think like you know people will talk about oh but these things won't be creative you know that it's like a very roach exploring the decision tree of like ways to prove something but any chess enthusiasts who follow alphago seem to agree that in very rigidly defined formal environments you can have an element of creativity that seems to be coming from the computer and math seems like really the lowest hanging fruit for that in a non-gamified circumstance so that that promises to be pretty interesting in the next next century cool um i want to ask you just a couple just quick questions we'll bump around for a couple minutes the first uh quote and then a couple questions just about you in particular here's the quote from angus rogers mathematics requires a small dose not of genius but of an imaginative freedom which in a larger dose would be insanity uh yeah okay so i like that it seems to be hitting on this idea that insights come from exploring something that no one else thought to explore because it really seemed like it wouldn't yield anything like wow you'd have to be kind of crazy to try working with this structure or to tweak the equation in this way or to bring in this uh this uh new feature to your diagram or something like that like it it requires doing something that other people wouldn't think to do and that there's kind of a reason they wouldn't think to do it um and so that too much of that is just indistinguishable from insanity because it means completely violating like the norms and priors for what will work yeah that's a very beautiful quote that's from one of your videos it's from the series linear algebra you're saying it like i don't know it i was like well i got another quote for you from one of your videos oh so funny well it's fine it was four years ago i can't remember yeah and look that's that's that's the benefit of creating online right you can create something years ago and i could just go on and watch with a whole fresh mind it exists forever okay one more from that same series unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is you have to see it for yourself oh yeah that was fun uh yeah i just thought that was like a wonderful that one i do remember including because like the whole theme of that series was that to think about matrices you should visualize them and there's a specific way to visualize them and that you have this like famous thing from cinema where morpheus is saying you have to see it for yourself like that i mean come on the parallel's too strong not to lean into yeah a lot of that is true i think like this this is the central theme of the whole channel for everything else that we talked about like the actual reason i think a lot of people are engaged is because it centers on visuals and we're very visual thinkers and a ton of just like a ton of the mass of our brains goes towards visual processing in contrast to processing other raw sensory information um and i think that it's almost like you're leveraging more computation and through that it means that you've like opened up the scope of what people can have intuitions for oh man that is a really interesting point i mean i think that there's something even further that's going on is it's the motion of visuals and the way that moves in your videos that creates an element of resonance yeah i mean i guess that's sort of maybe because it's it feels different than reading a textbook and that's the thing that most highlights the fact that it's not the way that you've been experiencing math through uh through school is the the like dynamic nature to it i'm not entirely despite what i do for a living i'm not entirely sold that the movement matters that much for the intuitions hmm i think that the movement matters well i mean it obviously depends on the video but i think that it matters the most when you just have to see how how how things are represented for example you you talked about the boxes and how the boxes hit each other and then the boxes hitting each other equals pi and the and then when you sort of rotated the sphere in that video i think that it's sort of unforgettable in a way and the unforgettable nature of it sort of makes it sticky in my head how much do you think of yourself as teaching math versus populizer popularizing math versus inspiring people to learn math on their own oh yeah three different angles i mean so when it comes to teaching i think to gain a new understanding something it has to be information flowing from inside your head out of it not the other way around so you can't have someone come and like pour knowledge into your head instead they have to evoke it out and in fact the word education has its root in um has the same root as the word edus like to bring out you kind of follow the etymology tree and i think there's no coincidence there it's this very socratic idea and so in that way the default for any video or any lecture or any book is that like teaching but that's a little too easy to say because really it's like it is quite possible for a piece of text or for a lecture to evoke something to bring it out of so if there is teaching that happens it's only because of that the truth is though the actual value add i think lies almost entirely on the inspiration half for like getting someone to feel that math is something that they um that they like that they can't understand that's worth pursuing further that they can self-identify with that can be part of their personality all of that in order for that to work though you can't just inspire by like saying inspirational words around it you have to give an actual lesson you have to give if not understanding at least the illusion of understanding in a moment for that inspiration to have any kind of teeth to it so most of the effort is still going to be around making something understandable being as clear as you can finding the elucidating visual all of that even if the end goal and the actual mechanism of value add comes from inspiration and not from what will this person be able to recall a few months later that's a beautiful place to close grant thank you very much hey thanks for having me on this is fun
