presentation all right i'm gonna share my screen hopefully nothing embarrassing pops up can you all see this great all right let me present and we will get going all right so this uh workshop would not be complete without a not boring pun so how to write not boring is what we're calling today's session uh well let's get started so the first thing first that i want to kind of just set the stage with is that it was never obvious to me that writing was going to be anything more than a way to just exercise my brain organize what i was reading keep in touch with friends like i did not plan for not boring to to get big and i think that's kind of an important uh thing to keep in mind as you're going through this i know that if i were sitting here and when i first kind of heard of rite of passage i was like this is cool but like i'll get 100 subscribers if i do this like there are famous people out there who are good writers and popular and whatever and they're a special type of person and then there's me so to set the context me at the time i grew up outside of philadelphia i went to duke studied econ did finance in finance got kicked into a group called public finance after bank of america and merrill lynch merge which is not exactly what i wanted to do but it was a good a good learning experience i actually was getting ready to to go back to school to go to business school in 2013 i had my deposit down bags packed ready to go and then i found a company on angelus called breather and so i decided to not go to business school and spend four months interviewing for this one company didn't apply anywhere else and ended up getting this job as the first u.s employee breather so my first year there i was the only person in the u.s i was going out and signing leases we acquired office space and and turned them into little meeting rooms that you could unlock with your phone so i was doing that i was cleaning spaces i was running around i had no time for writing no time for anything other than work 24 7 we were open seven days a week which meant as the only person i was working seven days a week fast forward kind of five years in four years in breather wasn't doing particularly hot we expanded too fast we had way too many spaces on the platform margins were bad whatever uh and so me and one other person on the team decided to try to fix it and we're like alright cool we have all of the supply we only rent for a few hours at a time what do we do and so kind of over christmas break we locked ourselves in rooms together luckily we had breather spaces that weren't being used all over the city which was the problem uh and came up with a plan and then tried to convince the company of the planet to do that we wrote and we wrote this like very long doc with numbers and graphs and charts and plans and all this stuff detailing what breather should do to save itself and we had negative margins and we were trying to obviously make this a positive margin business that could still grow and so we came up with this plan to start running our spaces out monthly which doesn't sound it sounds like we work now the time was was at least a little bit innovative and worked with what we were doing also controversial in the company because we were small spaces short meeting times that was like exactly what we did and so we had to convince the company we convinced the company using kind of this document that the two of us wrote so i was like all right this writing thing there's something something here something to it did it turned around the company negative 25 margins positive 25 margins like it worked and i was kind of hooked on writing so i really got into strategy started reading a lot more ben thompson started writing more internal memos and the company is doing better and better and better however we let go of our ceo at one point uh and uh brought in a professional ceo at some point after i was running the company for a few months and as soon as that happened like strategic thinking and writing were no longer at a premium they were discouraged it was just like a shitty environment to be in frankly and so like that's when i knew that i needed to start thinking about one getting out which i was too much of a wimp to do immediately i managed 150 person team i didn't want to abandon them all of that and so two knew that i needed to kind of exercise my brain in another way because i'd gotten hooked on on writing internally at least and so that's when i saw this tweet from david who again at the time was like this foreign internet celebrity i think he probably had like 20 000 followers or something at the time for an internet celebrity and i was like all right cool this sounds actually like maybe weird i don't know but it sounds like something that's at least like worth a shot to try writing online incredibly scary but i'll sign up for the course i have a learning and development budget i think breather gave us two thousand dollars a year so i had a learning and development budget that i used towards the course and signed up so took the course showed up the first thing that we did was we had to write uh write an essay and david's tip here was like to start like don't think about coming up with something totally new just find the people that you respect the most out there and summarize their work like there's a bunch of really dense good content on the internet there's some value in just being able to summarize the kind of great ideas that other people have put out there so the first post that i did there's a draft on the left-hand side and the actual post on the right-hand side was called the best event and it was kind of my personal experience kind of reading ben thompson and then trying to figure out what breather's strategy should be i remember posting that thinking it was garbage like i think that everything that i write is garbage and then we came to the next session and david called it out as like the best thing that had been written that week which was like this very little thing that i'm sure he forgot about but to me it was like oh wow like maybe i could write like there's 50 or so people in this class and he said this was the best thing like maybe i should keep writing and so i think that one little piece of encouragement got me to kind of stick with it which has been by far the most important thing is just showing up and writing every week but yeah let me start it out with just like you know ben thompson he'll come up again and again i think in the story fast forward that was just kind of like to my pacquiao.com blog that had zero readers i think probably like three people outside of the write a passage course actually read that we had to sign up we had it we had to sign up for sub stack write a start a newsletter and get 20 people to sign up which again at the time seemed like absolutely impossible i hate asking people for favors all of this is like petrifying to me to have to do this so i sent out this tweet and i had i think 300 followers at the time i think most of these likes have actually probably come since that initial tweet probably had like seven likes but i think i got like 25 people to subscribe to this newsletter it's now called ethel's newsletter because i changed it from pacquiao.com to not boring.co and somebody named ethel tried to sell uh products using my old sub stack uh so hopefully she sold some but that was that was where it started i called the email per my last email it was very different than what not boring is today so like here it is on the the right hand side here the first newsletter that i ever sent the first thing that i highlighted was that puja's parents signed up for the newsletter that was a big win for me it was like very personal i put a personal update up front a picture of fuji and i may be actually wearing the same shirt that i'm wearing today i need to expand my my wardrobe that was not intentional it was a week of the game of thrones finale so i put a link to that and then i linked to an interactive course i made on the sixers process i was just like kind of experimenting thinking about like maybe there's something that you can do to create online courses that remix the content that's out there so i have this medium post with a bunch of embeds that kind of works into a course i think 100 people did it so that was actually pretty good another little piece of um but yeah for you know a year for my last email was just me kind of reading things finding links summarizing them putting them out there i was petrified every week of sending the thing i thought that my friends were gonna think that i was an idiot for writing a newsletter and that i had nothing to add like legitimately thought that the whole time and was petrified most of the time that i had sent fast forward um you know i left breather at the end of 2019. i was thinking about starting something called the not boring club which was going to be an in-person thing that was kind of a mix of sew house and college extracurriculars i had a debate club going on the side thought it would be a lot of fun in retrospect probably would have been a really bad business and a slog to get off the ground but it gave me the name not boring at least but when covet hit you know i've been doing welcome dinners we were letting the initial members into the group and then they started getting cancelled and i don't think we should be doing 12-person group dinners in the middle of this thing it seems like there might be something here so i was like damn all right so i moved the community online i realized that i did not like being an online community manager it's a really really hard job and again like it requires a lot of one-on-one sales which i'm petrified of so i was like all right what do i do next all i have is this newsletter that at the time i think had you know 400 people on it it's like i'm just going to change the name of this thing to not boring like maybe i'll merge it with the club maybe it'll be its own thing i have no idea changed the name like announced that the next one was going to be not boring and then that week i got covet so the first not boring newsletter i ever sent was uh it was me kind of writing like while i was dying on the couch and like sleeping and sweating whatever like just trying to get this thing out it ended up being late but got that one out i don't think i've missed a week for illness since then which is which is good um so the thing that i was focused on early on and i i and maybe i probably put these yeah early on i think like the big shift uh from kind of where i was with my last email to not boring was that i started writing essays and so instead of doing links and listen i started writing essays i was worried about this transition too because i was like look ben thompson is out there he writes about the thing that i'm most interested in which is tech strategy and i'm never going to do that as well as he does and so like what's the point so i wrote about all sorts of stuff i wrote about community i wrote about sleep i would find some interesting like scientific papers and read about those and it was really really all over the place when it was all i was doing and i was like if i'm going to do this every week and write a full essay every week i'm just going to start writing about the things that i'm interested in and instead of trying to change the subject i'll change the tone of voice and so i think that's like a little tip is that even if someone writes about your subject they probably don't write about it in the same way that you would if you kind of let your own personality come out there so in the beginning what i was really really focused on when this was my only job it paid me zero dollars there were no advertisers inside there were a thousand i think people a few weeks in signed up to the thing really focused on growth one growth hack that worked is launching on product hunt so we got ready read all of the how to launch on product guide made a landing page because you need something new to be able to launch on product on because i had this thousand person newsletter as soon as we launched i was able to hit send and say like hey everybody i don't think you're allowed to ask people to like it on product temple like go check out this product on and for whatever reason it took off and just kind of gained this momentum momentum and ended up in number two product of the day which i think doubled the amount of subscribers that i had from 1500 or so to about 3 000. that was like the big moment where i was like oh my god i might actually be able to like do this and so beg my wife to let me kind of keep doing it and not get a job and all of that so three things that i learned from rite of passage that i took into writing not boring one is finding your personal monopoly and so this was a long and winding road for me the personal monopoly is this idea that and david can correct me if i'm not getting it exactly right but my interpretation of it is you're interested in a weird set in a weird intersection of different things the intersection of which is actually probably unique so if you're interested in tech strategy and the cleveland indians and math like there's probably some intersection of those three things that can get you your initial niche audience for me i was like racking my brain for a year as i was taking the course i was like i think this personal monopoly thing is kind of bs like i have no idea what mine is i must not be that interesting because i i don't there are no things that i uniquely like um and so i have this cute winding road graphic because it was a long and winding road to figure out kind of what that personal monopoly was and what it ended up being was not changing as i mentioned what uh the topic that i was writing about but changing how i wrote about it and so i have the mickey mouse club here because the first piece that i think really broke through for me there was a piece that i wrote on uh creative destruction like this economic concept but using the mickey mouse club as the example and so i was like all right so maybe there's something here with kind of the intersection of pop culture and strategy and economics and finance and so i was starting to kind of build my personal monopoly but the takeaway here is like it was not easy and you should like really just kind of write and figure out what interests you the most because that the most important thing is going to be continuing to to show up one of the one of the things when it comes to personal monopolies that i think is really worth considering at least from pakistory and that you'll see over and over is one of the places where people go wrong when it comes to building their purse monopoly is they try to basically be these like big top-down architects well they'll say this is going to be my personal monopoly it's going to be a combination of this thing and that thing and this thing over here it's like and then through these three intersections i'm going to look at like the total addressable market and then we're going to figure it out from there and they're very top-down sort of rationally driven but i think that what stands out about pakis is how organic it was how emergent it was and i found a direct correlation between how organic the growth and development of a personal monopoly is and how sustainable and differentiated that person monopoly ends up becoming when i first met the very first time i have a photo right here so packy and i we went to uh union square in new york and we went to i don't know why we went to this place i think it was because we had lunch in union square at this like decently like cool outside restaurant we're sitting outside talking and then we're like oh we're gonna go work and kellogg's kellogg's had a pop-up and so pack and are like oh yeah that sounds great let's go get some cereal and then we played this game where like you could see sort of behind me you sort of like throw this little circle and it has to land on the hook remember that packy so when we were there when we were having that conversation packy had no idea that this is what things were going to become in terms of the fun and the humor that he brings to his writing he i mean he basically sat me down and said hey i'm thinking of building this in-person club it's going to be kind of like soho house but it's going to be a little bit more like intellectual and stuff i'm like that's like a decent idea but like i like this guy would be a little bit more supportive that like i'm not sure that's a great idea but like the point is not that i knew what was right that's not what i'm trying to say at all it's that packy just kind of kept on going and really paid attention both to sort of this combination of what is fun for me what is appealing to my audience and in the intersection of those two things let's just double down on that and so as you listen to paki's story listen to all the things that didn't work but then also listen to how deliberate was about sort of flowing with the universe and basically going to a personal monopoly that evolved that ended up being organic and that's why there's no one that has this weird combination of things like and that's why we like his stuff amen is my screen still up okay i stole it from you it said uh do you want a disabled pakis screen sharing i said that's exactly what i want to do so this is just like a quick kind of back of your mind you don't have to write anything down but just like while we're here think of the three things that you're most interested in and the three ways that your friends would describe you and i think the second part of that is the part that i missed the first time uh i was just thinking about three things that i was interested in but i think so much of it is how you bring your own kind of personality and interests and just like what makes you unique to it that ends up helping you find your voice so three things you're most interested in three ways your friends would describe you you don't do anything with those now but if you take right of passage i've given you a head start uh on on finding your personal monopoly hey packy i have a question and i'm gonna sort of cloud it in the story so i've been reading the wright brothers biography and one of the things is there's a concept that i've begun to pick up by reading the biography which is this concept of surprising similarities and a lot of times our ideas intellectual ideas of what things in a personal monopoly could be adjacent aren't actually what are adjacent when it comes to the wright brothers biography this is what i mean the wright brothers in the late 19th century the big craze was this crazy thing called the bicycle all these people are riding the bicycle all these old men and women were like oh the bicycle's bad because kids aren't gonna be reading books they're gonna go too far away from home the bicycle's making things dangerous but people loved bicycles the wright brothers lived in dayton ohio and they said you know what we're gonna open a bicycle shop wilbur was the older brother and he sort of said you know what i'm not very fit for business but the dad he was a preacher and he had all these books in the house and so wilbur the older brother started reading all these books and the wright brothers realized huh this is weird what we learned about making bicycles actually really helped us with flying airplanes and that those two things even though one is on the ground one is in the sky like both geographically and intellectually it seems like they couldn't be further apart they were actually surprisingly similar in the skills that were acquired in order to achieve them and i'm wondering for you packy if there are any sort of surprising similarities in your own story things that came through in your personal monopoly were like i did that over here and it's actually really close but it seems like a long way away yeah i mean it maybe doesn't even seem like a long way away like i was you know kind of uh both class clown and a good student i think kind of throughout school and so like literally i would write essays that i'd get you know in high school or something that i'd get an a plus on but it was like jane eyre as a dominatrix because i had a really strict english teacher who i wanted to make laugh and i wanted like i wanted to write i wanted it to be like such a tightly argued essay and weird that like she had no choice but to give it a good grade despite the fact that she was uptight and so i think like that's hopefully kind of one of the things that sticks in my writing is that i want it to be like funny and fun and approachable and like a good way for you to learn kind of about what's going on in the world without actually feeling like you're sitting down and learning uh but you know also also kind of fun and tightly argued so i think that's that's a big one that comes to mind all right number two most essays don't start as fully formed ideas that's another one and i think we'll get it a little bit more into the writing process again uh in a little bit but this is another one that david said during read a passage that i like didn't fully get or understand where he's like just like if you have an interesting idea like start asking your friends about it and see what's surprising and see if they find it interesting at all or not interesting at all and then if there is like that little spark of curiosity and interest in something that that seems to surprise them then like start pulling on that thread and go a little bit deeper and then tweet about it and then maybe do a thread and then finally you can like work your way up into an essay and so that's like a trick that i do a lot of times when i'm writing an essay like where you know i was writing about axe infinity and i saw the revenue charts and so i would run it by a few different people and be like have you heard of axiomfinity like did you know that they're on pace to do like 150 million dollars in revenue in july alone and bubble and then if people were shocked then i knew there was something there and they were so i developed that another trick that i do it's like my brain is just as i've written a million times like really just not wired to see the downside and things and so when i was writing about ethereum i was sitting there i was like all right what's the bear case what's the bear case what's the bear case and so instead i just did like a bait kind of tweet where i asked people why not why i shouldn't just put a ton of my money into ethereum and i got over a thousand responses that kind of like arguable case and like let me know what i should bolster throughout the essay so i think this can be a lot more fun if it's an interactive process i also like not revealing what i'm writing about too early sometimes so it's a delicate balance there i don't want to don't want to spoil the surprise but it is helpful if i'm stuck on something to just kind of talk to friends or or tweet about it out of time so think about a topic you're dying to tell your friends or family about then tell them and then see what surprises them and what bores them i want to pop in here and and and just build on something that was saying that i think is really important doesn't always look like writing and what that means is that is doing writing in conversation did you hear the word shocked that he said what he's doing is he finds something he's like oh that's interesting and all this is happening at a subconscious level but he's saying oh that's interesting i'm gonna go tell people and then if time and again people are shocked that then means that i should be writing about that and what pac is doing without even realizing it he's already doing it so it doesn't cost him any extra time is as he tells people he's working out two things first how he should structure the piece which happens automatically by telling people and second of all he is getting a sense of what is confusing to people and what the inevitable follow-up questions are and then by the time that gets to a place where he sits down to write stuff he's already worked out a lot of the hard problems of writing 100 100 another trick that i just thought of in this category i wrote a piece last year about kind of the return to work and the fact that like we're never going back fully to the office kind of full-time like we like we have in the past and that just came from conversations with pusho and my wife about like her not wanting to go back to the office and being like but it's like there's not anything that i can like just point my boss to that says like this is why i shouldn't go back to the office and i was like i bet there are probably a lot of people out there who want just like one kind of condensed argument as to why people aren't like the best companies aren't gonna bring their employees back to the office and so like that's where that came from so i think a lot of it too comes from like finding things that maybe people are either like talking about but no one's crystallized in a good way uh or like an argument that no one's made exactly in the most useful way so there's a bunch of like just i think the cool thing about writing or one of the cool things about writing is that it changes the way that you have conversations and that you listen to things and that you read things because you're like always on the hunt for that little nugget that you can use in your next essay so i think it makes you just a more present like better thinker exactly and the thing is the difference is that a lot of people think of writing as in order to write i need to cancel all my plans for the weekend and i need to not see anybody and yes sometimes in order to write you're gonna need some deep work time but there's a lot of writing that you can do just during the course of your life and if you want to write more and do it at a higher quality it just requires a subtle perspective shift of being more aware of how others are responding to you and how your body is basically reacting to different ideas what is exciting to you just getting aware of that makes writing so much easier for you a hundred percent that said a thesis really helps so like i think it helps for this very reason like once you have your thesis or once you have a kind of spark of the idea and you develop what the thesis is then you can like really start pulling in those kinds of things as you're cruising twitter or as you're talking to your friends or as you're doing whatever you do in your daily life that said hopefully sometimes in the seventh the facts as you do more research can change your thesis so don't get married to something but it does help to kind of have something that all the little pieces can stick to as you're as you're thinking and then number three this is another one that i thought was like total to be honest was the serendipity engine because i was like coming at it from you know 300 twitter followers and i would tweet something about the philadelphia eagles and no one would respond and i was like this one doesn't make any sense to me but one of the ideas was you know the point of writing online is that you develop the you build this serendipity engine and you open yourself you open yourself up to all sorts of interesting conversations and people who are interested in the same thing coming talking uh talking to you about those things and maybe giving you opportunities in those fields and all of that kind of stuff i think this is kind of the idea that that i had in my head when i was writing this piece called the great online game which is like really if you just jump in and play and that might be writing that might mean joining a discord that might mean you know like joining a group chat that that uh has a bunch of people who are nerdy about like the very particular thing that you are if you just like kind of get out there and put out what you're what you're interested in really wild stuff happens and like it seems counterintuitive but then the math is also kind of crazy like there's over three billion people online like niches can be absolutely massive and the internet's really really good at helping you find like the other few people who are interested in that very particular thing that you are and so if you can put out well-reasoned and structured thoughts on the thing that you're interested in it really does actually kind of attract you know other people who are interested in this those same things so that's been one of the coolest parts by far of of writing online and this is an important point too because i've seen both sides of it you have to write about something that you actually care about and want to spend a lot of time talking about because it attracts people whether it's like actually the thing that you're interested in or not and so i've written about things that i'm less interested in and then people will be like hey you want to grab a coffee and talk about that thing and i'm like no i never want to talk about that thing ever again uh and so you know it it is it's such a powerful thing that it even attracts people that you don't want to talk to necessarily um so i think that's just another kind of point in the favor of just like even if you don't think it's gonna be the most popular thing in the world pick the thing that you're most interested in because cool stuff will happen even if it's on a micro scale packy can you share a story of a kind of serendipity that was wild to you in terms of maybe somebody you met in person or something that came from writing online that was like like whoa i would have never gotten this had i not been sharing my ideas in public yeah i mean in terms of like i wrote about it in one of the emails but like and i the acquired podcast is one that i've just like listened to forever i thought that david and ben were the host for like again these like foreign deities who just had a deep voice and talked about like all the companies that i was interested in and did a better job on it than i ever could and all of that then i wrote a piece on slack which is like this company that you know we all use all the time that i thought was just beaten up too much by the market and then like this wild thing happened where after i wrote about it a couple weeks later salesforce came in and bought slack and then the next thing you know like ben and david invited me on the choir to talk about the acquisition of slack and it was just like i'm not a slack expert i was just like willing to go out there and say like everybody's wrong about this company like it's worth more than you know than people think and because of that i have to meet these guys who i've listened to all of the time and now they've become really good friends so that's what i mean even the fact that i you know we're here and there's as many people on the zoom as i had twitter followers when i started writing is absolutely crazy right like i don't know i mean it was like i mentioned it was cool to even be called out that one time in like one sentence where you're like hey this is a good essay and so now the fact that you'd even invite me to come do this like all those kinds of things like it's little things that happen kind of almost daily at this point there was a job i can't say which company unfortunately but it like wasn't even an actual job it was just like something that somebody made up and was like would you be interested in like designing your own thing here and working with these people and it was a job that i would have murdered multiple people for you know just six months ago and i was like you know what actually like the writing thing is great i'm i'm not going to do that but like those kinds of things i think just happen with surprising frequency and like do starting early on like there were things too where there were you know i had a thousand subscribers on the newsletter and somebody who was related to the company that i wrote about would reach out or something like that so it happens the whole time it's not just it's like a now thing what sticks out to me here is most of us most people in the world who spend a lot of time on the internet the shape of their life looks something like this they spend all this time reading watching videos obsessing over stuff alone and then they'll go out they'll see friends they'll see family and the people in their lives just aren't interested in those things and so they live these weird two-faced lives where when they're alone they're enthusiastic they're passionate about ideas and then when they get out into the world they have to suppress and squash that enthusiasm what writing online gives you it's not about being famous it's not about having a lot of followers that's not the point the point is living a life where the people who you surround yourself with elevate your intellectual ambitions elevate and expand your curiosity and add to the flame enthusia of enthusiasm rather than trying to suck all the oxygen out of it so yeah why writing lineups worth it that's good uh i mean like that i didn't think says it very well i think it's also never been more important to be able to tell a good story and that doesn't mean that it's your full-time gig and that you decide that you want to leave your job and become a writer and write a newsletter like that is a weird path to take and i only like you know back where i fell ass backwards into it because that was kind of what was in front of me when covid started but i think writing even just for yourself help helps you make sense of everything so one of the first reasons i actually wanted to start writing was you know i would read a ton and then someone would ask me a detail about a thing that i'd read and i'd be like i forget the character's name because i like just didn't do anything with the information and it fell out of my brain and i have a terrible memory it's obviously a valuable skill at any company and i would have said this before covid but particularly postcode when more companies are remote the ability to express yourself in the written world i think is is just an increasingly valuable skill actually i mean the not boring club was as david mentioned not a great company idea but it was an interesting way for me to like kind of mvp it in a really low-cost way without writing a line of code without hiring anybody without anything just write essays related to the idea put them out there and see what people thought about them and on the investing side i think it's useful because it just kind of clarifies you're thinking it makes you take all these different things and put them down kind of on one page and say like here's my here's my thesis so even if you don't want to write full time i think it's a valuable skill to start to start uh practicing and then i guess the last serendipity engine things i started the story i made this deck last night before i had the ben thompson thing in there it was the first thing i've ever read about wrote about my favorite uh writer someone who i almost didn't write about what i wanted to write about because i thought it would never be as good as ben thompson and then this morning he quoted me and like i had a full section in strategy which is like my favorite is it this guy's like my writing hero so it's just like a weird thing that i just would never in a million years have anticipated what happened and so i don't know i thought that timing on that was crazy that we were having this session today and that happened this morning so uh good things interesting things at least like this i didn't make a million dollars off of him doing that like it's not life-changing but it's just like the series of very cool serendipitous things that happen and then last but not least the not boring process how i write not boring i've included this graphic in the email as well this is still very true where it is like every single week a total rollercoaster to get a piece out i think probably and i'd love to hear david's thoughts on this like if for him it's more of a more of a structured process that is predictable and all of that for me it is absolutely not that it is you know thinking about i have no idea for example what i'm writing about this monday this past week's essay the one that ben thompson linked to i wrote after i got back driving from a wedding on sunday woke up at 5 30 got back at noon and started writing um and so it's like a messy nerve-wracking process every single week so i actually don't have like a really great overarching writing process but i would say one consume broadly in the things that that you're curious about two as i mentioned pull on the surprising things and then three it does get easier over time as you have these building blocks i think ben thompson is actually awesome at this he can put something pretty great out every day and half of it is like literal building blocks where he's just pulling from things that he's written before but even less kind of literally or obviously i think your knowledge just kind of compounds as you write about a particular thing over time and so while it doesn't get easier while i don't have a great process i feel like i can dive into something and at least pull on concepts that i've touched on before and that helps form kind of the overarching uh you know form a base that i can use when i go out and write so instead of instead of me kind of talking about a process i'd love to just like kind of riff with david on kind of what a good writing process looks like here and then what i should be doing differently and you can ask questions on how i'm doing it and all that yeah is it true that you listen to audiobooks while you sleep and then you have the process to make highlights i wish i mean i i really do wish there was an easier way to highlight podcasts because i spend so much of my writing process going back and re-listening to process to podcasts and just like trying to put it on you know 0.75 speed so i can type as fast as as they're talking um but yeah i mean for me it's a lot of immersion in content around a topic and then just starting to write and that's kind of what the writing process looks like so when you're listening to a podcast there's two kinds of information and i wanna know how you think about the differences between them the first kind of information is information that's relevant to the essay that you're working on right now you can take that piece of information and you go you can transcribe it throw it right in your piece but then the second kind of information those are the building blocks so what do you do when you're listening to a podcast in terms of differentiating between the two kinds of information and actually building those building blocks well also working towards publishing the essay that you're committed to working on this week so this is actually one thing that i need to figure out how to get better at it's related to my messy last minute process but i because i give myself kind of three days to write each piece particularly if i have a monday and a thursday piece in a given week i am fully zoned in on that one topic and so when i'm listening to something it's like the founder of the company or somebody talking about that company or somebody talking about a particular idea and so i'm just like looking for different tidbits and looking kind of just to generally understand it better and see if there are things that i wouldn't have thought about before if there are good quotes if there are things that are you know counter to the way that i think about the company all of that when i'm reading something listening to podcasts talking to people about it i'm looking for those types of things i think and hope that like as i'm just kind of consuming stuff some of it related to topics some of it's just scrolling twitter some of it just reading for fun that like some things just kind of float around in my brain and then when i'm panicking on thursday afternoon thinking about what i'm gonna write about on monday i can like somehow occasionally be like this thing is kind of interesting and so i think it's unintentionally in the back of my mind all the stuff that i've consumed but i'm not actively saying like all right this goes in my future bucket this goes in my right now bucket how do you think about structure are you one of those people who has a big whiteboard in their office and you go up and you do a bunch of post-its okay i'm getting a bunch of nods from you so i'm assuming that is absolutely not the case so let's go down this way i often think of writing like a game of sudoku where in sudoku you have the general box the entire puzzle that you're trying to figure out but then you have all the little boxes and first you got to get the little boxes right then you get the big box right but often you'll get a couple little boxes right but then you'll change something in another one that then invalidates all the work that you've done before and i think writing is similar and the longer the pieces that you write the more boxes there are in the sudoku puzzle so what do you do once your writing gets to be disjointed once you get to a place where something that you do over here now has all of these second and third order effects down here how do you actually begin to think about the construction of your pieces yeah if it's really a mess then i'll set up a different so every time i write i start out i used to start out with an outline doc which i don't do and i just realized that i don't actually like doing outline so i don't do that anymore so i start out with my notes in athens i start out which is like rome i start out uh with a blank google doc that i like change the font to spectral and like get in the zone by putting a title at least placeholder there uh and then i have a google sheet where i might do like little calculations as i go and then when it gets really bad i have what i call a dump doc which is for like those huge paragraphs or sections that i'll write that like i just don't think work or like maybe there's tidbits in but i don't want to just hit delete on them i rarely ever go back to that and pull things back in but instead of just deleting i take big sections and put them over there and rewrite things i do think sometimes it's as little as like figuring out the transition sentences and the connections between things and not as much the paragraphs themselves like the paragraphs themselves may be fine but they do feel like the flow is totally messed up and so i spent a lot of time thinking about like do all these things kind of feed into each other in the way that i think that they do i want to pop in here and ask about branding two things first what were some of the early indicators that your branding your style your aesthetic was working and then later on what caused you to pull back from the pop culture angle yeah so the pop culture angle was just you know i think that it started actually so before even at mickey mouse essay i was stuck at home early coveted we had amazon prime and so i watched the fashion show that they had on amazon prime and i was like wow there's actually like a bunch of stuff that feeds into amazon's strategy here and so it was like almost just an accident of cover that i was at home watching this thing and also interested in amazon and so i accidentally wrote a piece that kind of combined this dumb tv show with like amazon strategy and so that got goodish feedback and so they're cool like maybe there's something to pull on here then i was thinking about this like over optimistic take on kovid where i was like actually this is kind of going to be good there's like a lot of people stuck in jobs uploaded companies where they're not actually doing anything and like maybe this will break things free and then i'll go like that's kind of like the mickey mouse club and so like when i had two of those things in a row that kind of worked and then i was starting to get good feedback on i was like all right cool i'm gonna lean into this intersection of pop culture and tech and strategy and all of that honestly when it when when i stopped doing it was because i it was almost like writing two essays kind of like figuring out what the actual company and strategy whatever piece of it was and then spending a ton of time trying to think about like what the pop culture reference was that would work and writing about that and at some point it just felt like i was doing two times the work and it wasn't fully worth it and so i just decided to kind of slowly drop that but keep the tone because the tone was just kind of a natural tone anyway i like this line from one of your emails you write i had friends who were killing it in their careers and i legitimately thought that they were all sitting in a group text somewhere talking on me what do you say to a bunch of people here who want to write and who know that they have good ideas and they're afraid to publish for that same reason they're afraid that friends are going to judge them that family is going to make fun of them that people are going to belittle their hard work and thinking what do you say to those people who are afraid to stick their necks out and share their ideas in public this is i'll start with an unintentional sales pitch for for red passage on this one like one of the good one of the the best things for me from the course was not like you know anybody went in and corrected my sentence structure or i became like a better technical writer probably because of it but there was something to showing up to a group of people who won all of the work themselves so you at least had to do the work there was a bit of peer pressure and kind of hitting send and all of that but then also it's seeing like you know we have discussions on that exact feeling and seeing that everybody like even the people in the class that i looked up to the most and had more twitter whatever all had that exact same feeling where they felt like you know people were judging them and that that they couldn't hit them they were scared too and blah blah and the really the unlock for me other than just like doing it was the realization that like nobody gives a about you and like there's just way too much information out there for people to actually like spend time one reading your whole thing if they think it's bad uh and then two spending more time talking about it like i guess if there are people who want to do all of that you probably don't want to be friends with those people in the first place but like really like nobody there's so much content out there like nobody has time to hate read things unless they're an awful person and so like people just don't really care about you that much and i think that's a liberating thing that if something's bad nobody really cares and if something's great then people start caring but like the bad stuff everybody kind of just forgets pretty quickly like don't do anything offensive or awful but as long as it's just like not well written or something nobody cares one of the things that i think is so interesting about your marketing strategy is that it's changed and it's evolved so much and there's things like the product hunt experiment that you launched which was sort of a one-time thing then there were other things like the referral program that you ran where i think i saw things really take off for you and that seemed more consistent more deliberate over time so how do you actually think about different marketing growth and distribution strategies for yourself and when you double down and how you just in general think about growth on your email list yeah i guess another another couple tricks in the beginning i would write about a company and this was like kind of accidental but it worked where if i wrote about a company that had a lot of passionate employees they'd all share it and so that was a pretty good unlock i would join you know slack communities or something that were related and and you know be like hey i wrote this thing that you guys might be interested in which doesn't work particularly well but kind of can get you a few people and in the beginning i think it is just about getting enough like activation energy so like very much the polygram do things that don't scale in the beginning like getting to a thousand people help product unhappen which i'll get to three thousand people and then it's kind of grown uh on its own since then frankly in the past like nine months or so i haven't done much on the growth side and i've really tried to focus more on just like i don't have time even to do the girl stuff like just focus more on writing good stuff and i found that like at a certain point as long as you're writing good stuff it takes care of itself um so i think that was actually a kind of a freeing unlock was when i was like i'm gonna stop trying to do tactics and just write and hopefully it's good and if it's good it'll get out and if it doesn't actually one other one that i did was when i had a guest poster write about kim kardashian and kanye west i like went to a kardashian subreddit and posted it there and like it did fine i've gotten also banned from i'm sure a bunch of subreddits from uh hacker news from a bunch of stuff we're promoting um but ultimately if those people come in because they care about that one particular topic they're the most likely to leave also and to not be engaged and whatever so i'd rather just have people who kind of come to it on their own and are actually interested in the same things as opposed to people that i'm like begging or paying to come and read not boring what are you going for when you write a piece so you might have said it tongue-in-cheek earlier but you said that a lot of times when you publish you just don't think the piece is that good but presumably sometimes you think that what you've done is good so what are you going for what are you looking for as a writer that distinguishes for you a good piece versus a bad piece i mean i think actually the challenging part is like i never think it's great because and this is i think a common thing where i'll think about all the things that i wanted to kind of get to but couldn't figure out how to fit in the essay or like all the information that i had but couldn't include and so you almost i almost think about it as i assume that everybody who reads that particular piece like knows all that stuff and it's like why didn't you include all those things that you could have included and again like they don't they don't have that background and so it's like something that is just wrong in my head but i that's that's how i think about it so that's why i'm never like fully fully happy with it i think what i'm going for with it and this is kind of emerge over the past few months is like if i can make like i think the future is going to keep getting crazier and i wrote about that uh last week in this essay called compounding crazy and i think that there's either people who are like out there just like kind of brash and just assuming that everyone feels the same way that they do or they're idiots and then they're people who are just like things have to get less crazy like you know it's already too crazy right now and so i'm almost trying to be like the translator between those two and trying to like hey here's like why here's like the foundational reasons why like this is probably actually like this trend will continue and it's not a crazy thing it's grounded in like this old principle and whatever but it is more likely to continue to get crazy it's like trying to get people to be more uh you know open-minded and comfortable with new a things question on my end you use a lot of interesting metaphors you coin terms you use these you know playful language do you have a filter where there's certain things that uh you sort of toss in the reject pile or how do you think about hey this will play well this will really take up you know the great twitter game versus things that are just too far like what's your sense on what makes it what doesn't it probably feels like from the outside that there's more thought put into a lot of this stuff than there actually is the great online game i think i wrote that title that morning maybe or like you know i was writing it that that's that was another one where like sunday morning or saturday afternoon i had no idea what i was going to be writing about and so i was like all right i need to like kind of figure out like i am feeling this thing and actually those are some of the pieces i end up doing the best and they all feel the dumbest to me like i thought that was a fairly dumb piece because it just feels like this thing that's like kind of obvious because it's one of those things like floating out there but that hasn't been put into words kind of and so there's like something about just taking a big like hairy thing and just putting it into words even if it seems like non-groundbreaking uh that people resonate with but there's not a lot of intentionality about i wrote the word like superverse in the beats this week it was kind of like i don't know it's kind of i literally googled just to make sure that super means above and i was like all right cool like it kind of sits above all these other networks and dumped and breaks in so i don't think there's many times where i think there's a bridge too far i think as long as like i'm fun and playful with it and i'm not taking myself too seriously and i'm like here's the word supervisor you all need to use the word superverse now as long as it's like that's not my approach but it's just like i don't know here's a dumb word that i just made up then it's not as you know frightening to go throw something like that out how often um we had some questions in the chat about your idea generation how often do you have you know half a dozen ideas on the back burner that you're pulling off the shelf in a given week versus like something brand new that week that you didn't expect to write about yeah like like uh the outline doc there was also a dock at one point that was just a running list of ideas that i had uh and you know different companies that i read about or different topics to pull on and every time like even a few days later i went back to that list things would seem stale you know i think i wrote about when we did uh the write a passage fellowship and i had to write about one thing for multiple months i got so bored of that topic by the end of it i i'm just a little add on this stuff so any list that i would have had i think gets sale quickly and i think you know it makes it obviously like way more nerve-wracking than being able to plan in advance but i think it also hopefully keeps it fresher and i can like nfts exploded last week so i don't have to move something else out of the way to talk about the thing that happened last week i can keep it a little bit more current by not having a list got it awesome a couple questions in the chat about motivate motivation or stamina adam was asking about how do you find motivation when you ever felt like giving up at a certain point um anthony had asked when things become a slog how do you make sure you don't miss a week or fall behind so any tips especially for people starting out how to keep that weekly cadence that is the hardest hardest hardest part of this like i am just a street person kind of where you know like if one of the years when i was in investment banking out of school like working fairly brutal hours and would go to the gym and like maybe go run to the gym do one pull up and leave just so that i could like keep the streak going because i knew that if i broke that streak i'd be kind of done i feel like it's a little bit similar now there's actually a nice check on it now too so which i'll explain but i think it's a little bit similar now where i feel like if i give myself you know random week off then i can do that again in the future and so i just like even if nobody cares i'm like pretending like i think a lot of people care if i if i miss a week and just let myself start doing that the other thing now that i have is because i'm writing sponsored posts every other thursday what i really don't want to do is shift that balance too far where i'm like skipping mondays and then only doing sponsored posts and so i've built in that kind of mechanism for myself um but yeah i think it's more just like i'm a glutton for punishment on this kind of stuff i'm like all right it i said i have to write i'm gonna write something this week but like it is not like 100 like i am a carefree happy-go-lucky person normally i'd say a month ago it was like as depressed is too strong a word but like as stressed out as i have ever been in my life you know 10 month old 9 month old baby at the time not sleeping raising a venture fund trying to write two times a week i had a period where i had three thursday pieces back to back just by a kind of scheduling accident and i just thought i'd had to quit like i was so unbelievably stressed out and then you just do it and get through it and then now i'm kind of back to being just like a low grade moderate stress and so i think as long as you can realize like there's something on the other side there are going to be periods where it's more and less stressful yeah i want to pop in here with a comment so i think a lot of times when it comes to writing we want to be able to write to publish to be creative with no negative emotions and we say you know what i have negative emotions and those negative emotions or an excuse for me to opt out of the important work that i want to be doing and so we say i'm stressed i'm anxious i'm scared therefore i don't need to do anything we look for that convenient excuse to get out of it and it reminds me of a story of a story that jeff bezos shared in one of his annual letters a couple years ago i think it was 2018 and he talks about handstands of all things and he says something like this he says that there are two kinds of people in the world people who think that doing a handstand and getting to a place you can show up and do one is going to be easy and quick and there's other people who know that it's going to be difficult and slow and he said that the people who think that doing a handstand is going to be easy they're the ones that don't end up doing it it is the ones who know that it's going to be difficult and who push through it anyway knowing that it's going to take time those are the people who end up successfully doing handstands they persevere they know from the outset that the task at hand is difficult but worthy of that difficulty i think that this applies to writing because if we think that writing every piece is just going to be easy that it's your favorite writers or the ones where things just come naturally to them no negative emotions no stress no difficulty if we think that that's what good writers deal with we are never going to write once we face difficult emotions we're never gonna write so what we need to do as writers is say there's going to be negative emotions you're not going to be able to write consistently at a high quality day in and day out without negative emotions even if you do it weekly even if you do it monthly there's going to be negative emotions writing is hard and that's why it's useful you know it kind of reminds me of in another way of speaking of fitness like going to the gym it is the difficulty that you face at the gym that leads to gains in the long term writing is so similar and so as a writer it's not about trying to run away from the negative emotions trying to get to a place where we do not have any negative emotions it's trying to recognize that negative emotions are inevitable they are part of the growth process and like working out like a handstand it is going to take time it is going to be painful in certain moments but we push through it because the calling is worthy and because when you go through this kind of difficulty that's when you really learn about yourself and develop as a human being totally i mean like every week i haven't bothered because i've also kept it like i think there's probably you know advice to go more niche and less broad and whatever and i've decided to go fairly broad and cover kind of whatever interests me at the time um and so there's imposter syndrome like every single week and like even you know this piece that blew up on on nfts a little bit like there are tens of thousands of people first of all there's 10 000 punks that are owned i don't know in a single one of those like there are thousands of more people who are like more in it and qualified to like actually talk about the details of something so i think not pretending like i'm that like the guy and more just being like here's something that i'm seeing i like might be wrong on this and kind of catching it and those kinds of things certainly the feedback process is good and like trying to get somebody at least who knows what they're talking about on the topic to look at it every time to be like here's where you're just like totally wrong that's really helpful i like to avoid being totally wrong if i can but i think so much of it is now like kind of speculative at least that um as long as i'm honest about the fact that i don't have the answers but i'm seeing this cool thing happening then then i think that's how i get around it pacquiao i want to talk about the nature of inspiration what struck you about ben thompson's writing that made you say you know what i'm so inspired by this that i want to take a shot at doing it myself um 01:0:2,230 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:0:2,240 --> 01:0:5,119 there were a few 01:0:3,990 --> 01:0:5,119 01:0:4,000 --> 01:0:6,960 different things like one it was just 01:0:5,109 --> 01:0:6,960 01:0:5,119 --> 01:0:9,040 that people you know that i thought were 01:0:6,950 --> 01:0:9,040 01:0:6,960 --> 01:0:10,480 smart also were reading it i like you 01:0:9,030 --> 01:0:10,480 01:0:9,040 --> 01:0:13,599 know just thinking 01:0:10,470 --> 01:0:13,599 01:0:10,480 --> 01:0:15,280 about strategy and had before and liked 01:0:13,589 --> 01:0:15,280 01:0:13,599 --> 01:0:17,280 reading books and then i found certainly 01:0:15,270 --> 01:0:17,280 01:0:15,280 --> 01:0:19,359 and i was like oh cool like this is that 01:0:17,270 --> 01:0:19,359 01:0:17,280 --> 01:0:21,440 applied just like what's happening right 01:0:19,349 --> 01:0:21,440 01:0:19,359 --> 01:0:22,720 now and you can do this in real time and 01:0:21,430 --> 01:0:22,720 01:0:21,440 --> 01:0:24,400 so i thought that was cool and then it 01:0:22,710 --> 01:0:24,400 01:0:22,720 --> 01:0:26,160 was i mean it really was that thing a 01:0:24,390 --> 01:0:26,160 01:0:24,400 --> 01:0:28,400 little bit of breather where like as i 01:0:26,150 --> 01:0:28,400 01:0:26,160 --> 01:0:29,599 was doing things in real time i'd go 01:0:28,390 --> 01:0:29,599 01:0:28,400 --> 01:0:31,520 back to something that ben thompson had 01:0:29,589 --> 01:0:31,520 01:0:29,599 --> 01:0:33,359 written and like pull it in and some of 01:0:31,510 --> 01:0:33,359 01:0:31,520 --> 01:0:34,880 those were his new ideas some of them 01:0:33,349 --> 01:0:34,880 01:0:33,359 --> 01:0:36,640 were things like that he took from 01:0:34,870 --> 01:0:36,640 01:0:34,880 --> 01:0:38,960 clayton christensen but it was all like 01:0:36,630 --> 01:0:38,960 01:0:36,640 --> 01:0:40,559 in one easy to understand spot so i'd go 01:0:38,950 --> 01:0:40,559 01:0:38,960 --> 01:0:42,079 back there and be like oh i'm going to 01:0:40,549 --> 01:0:42,079 01:0:40,559 --> 01:0:44,079 try like think about this problem this 01:0:42,069 --> 01:0:44,079 01:0:42,079 --> 01:0:45,920 way and then it would work and so like 01:0:44,069 --> 01:0:45,920 01:0:44,079 --> 01:0:48,319 that to me was very cool 01:0:45,910 --> 01:0:48,319 01:0:45,920 --> 01:0:49,839 like i think that you know strategy can 01:0:48,309 --> 01:0:49,839 01:0:48,319 --> 01:0:51,680 one be overused and you can like kind of 01:0:49,829 --> 01:0:51,680 01:0:49,839 --> 01:0:53,920 seem like a shaolin if you're like i'm 01:0:51,670 --> 01:0:53,920 01:0:51,680 --> 01:0:56,400 the strategy guy in the company whatever 01:0:53,910 --> 01:0:56,400 01:0:53,920 --> 01:0:59,280 but i think going the opposite way is 01:0:56,390 --> 01:0:59,280 01:0:56,400 --> 01:1:0,640 also super dangerous where like 01:0:59,270 --> 01:1:0,640 01:0:59,280 --> 01:1:2,480 if your company 01:1:0,630 --> 01:1:2,480 01:1:0,640 --> 01:1:4,319 the ceo that we brought into breather 01:1:2,470 --> 01:1:4,319 01:1:2,480 --> 01:1:6,400 not a strategy guy and then like you 01:1:4,309 --> 01:1:6,400 01:1:4,319 --> 01:1:8,319 just don't have like you have a bunch of 01:1:6,390 --> 01:1:8,319 01:1:6,400 --> 01:1:10,000 people working really hard 01:1:8,309 --> 01:1:10,000 01:1:8,319 --> 01:1:11,680 in no direction which is almost the same 01:1:9,990 --> 01:1:11,680 01:1:10,000 --> 01:1:13,440 as like not working 01:1:11,670 --> 01:1:13,440 01:1:11,680 --> 01:1:14,880 the the effect is the same it's not 01:1:13,430 --> 01:1:14,880 01:1:13,440 --> 01:1:16,480 working hard but everybody's burnt out 01:1:14,870 --> 01:1:16,480 01:1:14,880 --> 01:1:18,319 also so it's just like this really 01:1:16,470 --> 01:1:18,319 01:1:16,480 --> 01:1:20,079 shitty thing and so i don't know i think 01:1:18,309 --> 01:1:20,079 01:1:18,319 --> 01:1:23,200 that there's i think of companies it's 01:1:20,069 --> 01:1:23,200 01:1:20,079 --> 01:1:24,480 full of a lot of people and so i think 01:1:23,190 --> 01:1:24,480 01:1:23,200 --> 01:1:25,920 that's what i liked about it is that 01:1:24,470 --> 01:1:25,920 01:1:24,480 --> 01:1:27,599 like these things that you write can 01:1:25,910 --> 01:1:27,599 01:1:25,920 --> 01:1:29,040 actually like impact 01:1:27,589 --> 01:1:29,040 01:1:27,599 --> 01:1:30,319 these people's like day-to-day and the 01:1:29,030 --> 01:1:30,319 01:1:29,040 --> 01:1:32,319 quality of their lives and like oh by 01:1:30,309 --> 01:1:32,319 01:1:30,319 --> 01:1:33,440 the way if these are great companies 01:1:32,309 --> 01:1:33,440 01:1:32,319 --> 01:1:36,240 reading this that are building things 01:1:33,430 --> 01:1:36,240 01:1:33,440 --> 01:1:37,440 that will help like humanity in some way 01:1:36,230 --> 01:1:37,440 01:1:36,240 --> 01:1:39,119 then having them think about it the 01:1:37,430 --> 01:1:39,119 01:1:37,440 --> 01:1:41,200 right way is like super important if it 01:1:39,109 --> 01:1:41,200 01:1:39,119 --> 01:1:43,200 means that you can like get a rocket to 01:1:41,190 --> 01:1:43,200 01:1:41,200 --> 01:1:44,880 space or like develop uh medical 01:1:43,190 --> 01:1:44,880 01:1:43,200 --> 01:1:46,240 technology or something so i'm not 01:1:44,870 --> 01:1:46,240 01:1:44,880 --> 01:1:47,760 saying that not boring has done that at 01:1:46,230 --> 01:1:47,760 01:1:46,240 --> 01:1:49,280 all i've been writing about nfts which 01:1:47,750 --> 01:1:49,280 01:1:47,760 --> 01:1:52,640 are very interesting but like not gonna 01:1:49,270 --> 01:1:52,640 01:1:49,280 --> 01:1:54,000 save people's lives for right now um 01:1:52,630 --> 01:1:54,000 01:1:52,640 --> 01:1:55,599 but i think like that's it that just 01:1:53,990 --> 01:1:55,599 01:1:54,000 --> 01:1:58,240 like it's a thing that i think was 01:1:55,589 --> 01:1:58,240 01:1:55,599 --> 01:2:2,480 probably either like too textbook and 01:1:58,230 --> 01:2:2,480 01:1:58,240 --> 01:2:3,760 like dry and quackish or like dismissed 01:2:2,470 --> 01:2:3,760 01:2:2,480 --> 01:2:4,720 and so trying to find like a middle 01:2:3,750 --> 01:2:4,720 01:2:3,760 --> 01:2:6,480 ground where it's like no this stuff's 01:2:4,710 --> 01:2:6,480 01:2:4,720 --> 01:2:8,000 like kind of fun and cool to think about 01:2:6,470 --> 01:2:8,000 01:2:6,480 --> 01:2:8,799 and you can apply it and your company 01:2:7,990 --> 01:2:8,799 01:2:8,000 --> 01:2:10,400 will actually do better and you'll be 01:2:8,789 --> 01:2:10,400 01:2:8,799 --> 01:2:13,039 happier in your job 01:2:10,390 --> 01:2:13,039 01:2:10,400 --> 01:2:15,119 so if that was looking back in the rear 01:2:13,029 --> 01:2:15,119 01:2:13,039 --> 01:2:17,839 view mirror at ben thompson where are 01:2:15,109 --> 01:2:17,839 01:2:15,119 --> 01:2:20,480 you trying to go now who is inspiring 01:2:17,829 --> 01:2:20,480 01:2:17,839 --> 01:2:23,680 you as a writer and how do you want to 01:2:20,470 --> 01:2:23,680 01:2:20,480 --> 01:2:26,720 evolve i am a terrible planner as like 01:2:23,670 --> 01:2:26,720 01:2:23,680 --> 01:2:28,319 as evidence i think by my my story like 01:2:26,710 --> 01:2:28,319 01:2:26,720 --> 01:2:30,960 not a good planner not good at thinking 01:2:28,309 --> 01:2:30,960 01:2:28,319 --> 01:2:32,000 ahead right now i'm writing 01:2:30,950 --> 01:2:32,000 01:2:30,960 --> 01:2:34,240 01:2:31,990 --> 01:2:34,240 01:2:32,000 --> 01:2:36,559 uh doing this this venture fund now how 01:2:34,230 --> 01:2:36,559 01:2:34,240 --> 01:2:38,799 about for actually improving your 01:2:36,549 --> 01:2:38,799 01:2:36,559 --> 01:2:40,640 writing like where is it lacking in 01:2:38,789 --> 01:2:40,640 01:2:38,799 --> 01:2:43,599 quality for you 01:2:40,630 --> 01:2:43,599 01:2:40,640 --> 01:2:46,160 it's too long for sure um 01:2:43,589 --> 01:2:46,160 01:2:43,599 --> 01:2:47,440 100 if i were a better writer my pieces 01:2:46,150 --> 01:2:47,440 01:2:46,160 --> 01:2:50,400 would be shorter and i'd be able to say 01:2:47,430 --> 01:2:50,400 01:2:47,440 --> 01:2:52,960 more and fewer words um and so that's 01:2:50,390 --> 01:2:52,960 01:2:50,400 --> 01:2:55,359 one where like you know if i ever get a 01:2:52,950 --> 01:2:55,359 01:2:52,960 --> 01:2:56,640 couple weeks off and like go back and 01:2:55,349 --> 01:2:56,640 01:2:55,359 --> 01:2:58,319 think about it or if i gave myself more 01:2:56,630 --> 01:2:58,319 01:2:56,640 --> 01:3:0,799 time to edit my pieces would all be 01:2:58,309 --> 01:3:0,799 01:2:58,319 --> 01:3:3,119 shorter i think that's the biggest one i 01:3:0,789 --> 01:3:3,119 01:3:0,799 --> 01:3:4,880 think you know my natural limitation is 01:3:3,109 --> 01:3:4,880 01:3:3,119 --> 01:3:7,680 that i don't i'm not particularly 01:3:4,870 --> 01:3:7,680 01:3:4,880 --> 01:3:9,359 skeptical uh and so that is another 01:3:7,670 --> 01:3:9,359 01:3:7,680 --> 01:3:11,359 thing that i'd love to get better at is 01:3:9,349 --> 01:3:11,359 01:3:9,359 --> 01:3:12,799 like really being able to red team 01:3:11,349 --> 01:3:12,799 01:3:11,359 --> 01:3:13,920 everything that i write ahead of time 01:3:12,789 --> 01:3:13,920 01:3:12,799 --> 01:3:16,880 and that's probably also something that 01:3:13,910 --> 01:3:16,880 01:3:13,920 --> 01:3:19,039 like more time helps with um but i think 01:3:16,870 --> 01:3:19,039 01:3:16,880 --> 01:3:21,520 like probably doing i don't know part of 01:3:19,029 --> 01:3:21,520 01:3:19,039 --> 01:3:24,000 me says like doing a more balanced take 01:3:21,510 --> 01:3:24,000 01:3:21,520 --> 01:3:25,440 and part of me says that 01:3:23,990 --> 01:3:25,440 01:3:24,000 --> 01:3:26,400 there's plenty of skepticism out there 01:3:25,430 --> 01:3:26,400 01:3:25,440 --> 01:3:28,079 and so the reason that people come to 01:3:26,390 --> 01:3:28,079 01:3:26,400 --> 01:3:30,079 not boring is for 01:3:28,069 --> 01:3:30,079 01:3:28,079 --> 01:3:32,480 uh kind of the more optimistic take on 01:3:30,069 --> 01:3:32,480 01:3:30,079 --> 01:3:34,240 things and so on the whole they get a 01:3:32,470 --> 01:3:34,240 01:3:32,480 --> 01:3:35,680 balance take and maybe it's not my job 01:3:34,230 --> 01:3:35,680 01:3:34,240 --> 01:3:38,480 to like 01:3:35,670 --> 01:3:38,480 01:3:35,680 --> 01:3:39,760 to red team my stuff um but i'd say 01:3:38,470 --> 01:3:39,760 01:3:38,480 --> 01:3:41,200 those are like the two kind of weak 01:3:39,750 --> 01:3:41,200 01:3:39,760 --> 01:3:42,640 points uh 01:3:41,190 --> 01:3:42,640 01:3:41,200 --> 01:3:46,559 you know and not boring as they're too 01:3:42,630 --> 01:3:46,559 01:3:42,640 --> 01:3:48,559 long and they're not skeptical enough 01:3:46,549 --> 01:3:48,559 01:3:46,559 --> 01:3:50,480 uh i got a question on information 01:3:48,549 --> 01:3:50,480 01:3:48,559 --> 01:3:51,920 consumption uh something a lot of people 01:3:50,470 --> 01:3:51,920 01:3:50,480 --> 01:3:54,480 struggle with i struggle with there's so 01:3:51,910 --> 01:3:54,480 01:3:51,920 --> 01:3:55,520 much information out there and 01:3:54,470 --> 01:3:55,520 01:3:54,480 --> 01:3:56,960 you know there's so many interesting 01:3:55,510 --> 01:3:56,960 01:3:55,520 --> 01:3:58,559 topics and there's so many depth in each 01:3:56,950 --> 01:3:58,559 01:3:56,960 --> 01:4:0,559 topic so do you have any rules of thumb 01:3:58,549 --> 01:4:0,559 01:3:58,559 --> 01:4:2,400 for information you say no to or 01:4:0,549 --> 01:4:2,400 01:4:0,559 --> 01:4:5,599 boundaries that keep you somewhat 01:4:2,390 --> 01:4:5,599 01:4:2,400 --> 01:4:9,599 focused without going too wide 01:4:5,589 --> 01:4:9,599 01:4:5,599 --> 01:4:9,599 oh that's a really good one um 01:4:11,349 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:4:11,359 --> 01:4:15,119 yeah i mean i'll it's not that there's 01:4:13,430 --> 01:4:15,119 01:4:13,440 --> 01:4:17,200 any like hard and fast rules it's really 01:4:15,109 --> 01:4:17,200 01:4:15,119 --> 01:4:19,440 just like as i'm pulling things i can 01:4:17,190 --> 01:4:19,440 01:4:17,200 --> 01:4:21,039 tell pretty quickly if it's well written 01:4:19,430 --> 01:4:21,039 01:4:19,440 --> 01:4:22,960 if there's gonna be anything novel in 01:4:21,029 --> 01:4:22,960 01:4:21,039 --> 01:4:24,640 there like all of that kind of stuff is 01:4:22,950 --> 01:4:24,640 01:4:22,960 --> 01:4:26,079 just like a sense that i get from having 01:4:24,630 --> 01:4:26,079 01:4:24,640 --> 01:4:27,359 just done a bunch of this where it's 01:4:26,069 --> 01:4:27,359 01:4:26,079 --> 01:4:28,079 like that this one doesn't actually seem 01:4:27,349 --> 01:4:28,079 01:4:27,359 --> 01:4:29,520 like it's gonna have much of a 01:4:28,069 --> 01:4:29,520 01:4:28,079 --> 01:4:30,880 conversation or it's poorly written or 01:4:29,510 --> 01:4:30,880 01:4:29,520 --> 01:4:32,960 it's like derivative of something else 01:4:30,870 --> 01:4:32,960 01:4:30,880 --> 01:4:34,720 that actually has the meat of the 01:4:32,950 --> 01:4:34,720 01:4:32,960 --> 01:4:36,640 argument and so i'd say it's more of a 01:4:34,710 --> 01:4:36,640 01:4:34,720 --> 01:4:38,079 sense than anything else because i think 01:4:36,630 --> 01:4:38,079 01:4:36,640 --> 01:4:40,000 going abroad and going to people that i 01:4:38,069 --> 01:4:40,000 01:4:38,079 --> 01:4:41,920 don't know it's where you can find some 01:4:39,990 --> 01:4:41,920 01:4:40,000 --> 01:4:43,760 of the coolest stuff that other people 01:4:41,910 --> 01:4:43,760 01:4:41,920 --> 01:4:45,119 don't know and like if you like go to 01:4:43,750 --> 01:4:45,119 01:4:43,760 --> 01:4:46,480 the deepest darkest quarters of the 01:4:45,109 --> 01:4:46,480 01:4:45,119 --> 01:4:47,599 internet you can find 01:4:46,470 --> 01:4:47,599 01:4:46,480 --> 01:4:49,440 i think more interesting information 01:4:47,589 --> 01:4:49,440 01:4:47,599 --> 01:4:51,440 that fewer people know about so i do 01:4:49,430 --> 01:4:51,440 01:4:49,440 --> 01:4:53,280 want to go super broad but i think you 01:4:51,430 --> 01:4:53,280 01:4:51,440 --> 01:4:55,200 can kind of tell if something's going to 01:4:53,270 --> 01:4:55,200 01:4:53,280 --> 01:4:57,280 be good or not early on and then you 01:4:55,190 --> 01:4:57,280 01:4:55,200 --> 01:4:59,359 know skip the rest if needed yeah so 01:4:57,270 --> 01:4:59,359 01:4:57,280 --> 01:5:1,119 instinct um people earlier had been 01:4:59,349 --> 01:5:1,119 01:4:59,359 --> 01:5:2,960 asking about podcasts you recommend i 01:5:1,109 --> 01:5:2,960 01:5:1,119 --> 01:5:5,119 guess i'll broaden

--> 01:5:58,079 01:5:56,799 --> 01:5:59,920 every day so like there are some people 01:5:58,069 --> 01:5:59,920 01:5:58,079 --> 01:6:2,640 that i'll that i'll read often and i'm 01:5:59,910 --> 01:6:2,640 01:5:59,920 --> 01:6:4,559 definitely forgetting people um but a 01:6:2,630 --> 01:6:4,559 01:6:2,640 --> 01:6:6,720 lot of it is just 01:6:4,549 --> 01:6:6,720 01:6:4,559 --> 01:6:8,480 you know trying to find new stuff by 01:6:6,710 --> 01:6:8,480 01:6:6,720 --> 01:6:10,079 spending like the fun part about this is 01:6:8,470 --> 01:6:10,079 01:6:8,480 --> 01:6:12,240 i can say spending time on twitter is my 01:6:10,069 --> 01:6:12,240 01:6:10,079 --> 01:6:14,240 job now and a lot of it is just like 01:6:12,230 --> 01:6:14,240 01:6:12,240 --> 01:6:15,760 kind of following people as i'm 01:6:14,230 --> 01:6:15,760 01:6:14,240 --> 01:6:17,440 interested in the topic and seeing what 01:6:15,750 --> 01:6:17,440 01:6:15,760 --> 01:6:19,359 people are talking about and reading 01:6:17,430 --> 01:6:19,359 01:6:17,440 --> 01:6:20,559 those things and going deep and then 01:6:19,349 --> 01:6:20,559 01:6:19,359 --> 01:6:22,559 there's i think 01:6:20,549 --> 01:6:22,559 01:6:20,559 --> 01:6:24,559 i've been on a kick of like the classics 01:6:22,549 --> 01:6:24,559 01:6:22,559 --> 01:6:25,920 recently where i did some tim urban and 01:6:24,549 --> 01:6:25,920 01:6:24,559 --> 01:6:27,200 then i did a piece that was based on 01:6:25,910 --> 01:6:27,200 01:6:25,920 --> 01:6:29,599 eugene way and the one that i'm writing 01:6:27,190 --> 01:6:29,599 01:6:27,200 --> 01:6:31,280 tomorrow is based on uh you know ben 01:6:29,589 --> 01:6:31,280 01:6:29,599 --> 01:6:33,680 thompson's amazon tax and so i think 01:6:31,270 --> 01:6:33,680 01:6:31,280 --> 01:6:34,799 like it's a combination of finding like 01:6:33,670 --> 01:6:34,799 01:6:33,680 --> 01:6:36,160 the new stuff that everybody's talking 01:6:34,789 --> 01:6:36,160 01:6:34,799 --> 01:6:38,319 about and then also applying it to some 01:6:36,150 --> 01:6:38,319 01:6:36,160 --> 01:6:39,920 like more kind of grounded things and 01:6:38,309 --> 01:6:39,920 01:6:38,319 --> 01:6:41,520 then older things to the test time a 01:6:39,910 --> 01:6:41,520 01:6:39,920 --> 01:6:42,880 little bit more and you know those 01:6:41,510 --> 01:6:42,880 01:6:41,520 --> 01:6:45,039 pieces are all i think in the past five 01:6:42,870 --> 01:6:45,039 01:6:42,880 --> 01:6:46,720 years so not like super super old but i 01:6:45,029 --> 01:6:46,720 01:6:45,039 --> 01:6:48,400 think it's like that combination that 01:6:46,710 --> 01:6:48,400 01:6:46,720 --> 01:6:50,319 that can be helpful 01:6:48,390 --> 01:6:50,319 01:6:48,400 --> 01:6:52,559 i have one a couple years ago a guy 01:6:50,309 --> 01:6:52,559 01:6:50,319 --> 01:6:55,119 named joel sapolsky wrote a series of 01:6:52,549 --> 01:6:55,119 01:6:52,559 --> 01:6:57,440 strategy letters and the best one in my 01:6:55,109 --> 01:6:57,440 01:6:55,119 --> 01:7:0,079 opinion is called it's just about this 01:6:57,430 --> 01:7:0,079 01:6:57,440 --> 01:7:1,920 idea of commoditizing your compliment 01:7:0,069 --> 01:7:1,920 01:7:0,079 --> 01:7:4,079 and the article is good but what's even 01:7:1,910 --> 01:7:4,079 01:7:1,920 --> 01:7:6,559 better is a guy named guern wrote a 01:7:4,069 --> 01:7:6,559 01:7:4,079 --> 01:7:7,760 summary sort of a reflection piece on it 01:7:6,549 --> 01:7:7,760 01:7:6,559 --> 01:7:9,200 01:7:7,750 --> 01:7:9,200 01:7:7,760 --> 01:7:11,200 one of 01:7:9,190 --> 01:7:11,200 01:7:9,200 --> 01:7:13,280 the best things i've come across when it 01:7:11,190 --> 01:7:13,280 01:7:11,200 --> 01:7:15,599 comes to thinking intelligently about 01:7:13,270 -->

01:8:48,229 --> 01:8:49,839 01:8:48,239 --> 01:8:52,719 three things that the entire curriculum 01:8:49,829 --> 01:8:52,719 01:8:49,839 --> 01:8:54,560 is built around and it's all about this 01:8:52,709 --> 01:8:54,560 01:8:52,719 --> 01:8:56,400 idea of playing the great online game 01:8:54,550 --> 01:8:56,400 01:8:54,560 --> 01:8:58,239 and ultimately becoming a citizen of the 01:8:56,390 --> 01:8:58,239 01:8:56,400 --> 01:9:0,000 internet if 01:8:58,229 --> 01:9:0,000 01:8:58,239 --> 01:9:2,560 you just want to start receiving some 01:8:59,990 --> 01:9:2,560 01:9:0,000 -->

emails in 50 days that go through the 01:9:6,630 --> 01:9:9,120 01:9:6,640 --> 01:9:11,359 three stages of the online writing 01:9:9,110 --> 01:9:11,359 01:9:9,120 --> 01:9:13,199 process which is coming up with ideas 01:9:11,349 --> 01:9:13,199 01:9:11,359 --> 01:9:15,279 putting them down on 01:9:13,189 --> 01:9:15,279 01:9:13,199 --> 01:9:17,440 the page and then getting to a place 01:9:15,269 --> 01:9:17,440 01:9:15,279 --> 01:9:19,279 where actually sharing those ideas out 01:9:17,430 --> 01:9:19,279 01:9:17,440 --> 01:9:20,880 and building an audience so the 50 days
