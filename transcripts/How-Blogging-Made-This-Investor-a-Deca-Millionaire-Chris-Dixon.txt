hey today's guest is Chris Dixon who is a venture capitalist and the author of this book read write own we talk about the future of writing where all of this is going so that you can start thinking about your career what it is that you want to do as a writer and start thinking about how do I make money how do I position myself well for the future it was through writing on the internet that he became a big name in Silicon Valley you've probably heard ideas like come for the tool stay for the network what nerdy people are doing now is what the smartest people will be doing in 10 years he coined those terms he was one of those OG bloggers back in the day and he must have written 300 500 blog posts had a bunch of conversations built and sold two companies and then he took a step back and he said I have something important to say something valuable to share with the world and I want to turn that into a book so hey let's get to it here's my conversation with Chris [Music] Dixon Chris you're somebody who stands out as a particular kind of writer somebody who's written literally hundreds of blog posts blog posts that really influenced me thought about these things for decades and then packaged the best ideas that came out of the things you wrote the comments the conversations and then turned that into a book tell me about that process so you know I've been sort of interested in computers my whole life um I ended up um going a little off the path and and and actually studying philosophy in college and getting actually getting master's degree where I did a lot of writing as part of that program and um um then in the early 2000s got excited about the internet and and started a career there where I became an entrepreneur I started to internet startups and um since then have have switched to investing in Internet startups um along the way I um I think around 2008 or so decided you know I I felt like I was well one that was sort of the the for those who are active on the internet that was sort of of the beginning middle of the rise of social media and so people were just sort of getting more active online and Twitter was starting to grow and blogging was a thing and and I thought that was exciting just from an internet Trends point of view um and then I just felt like I had a lot to say um and so I started blogging and like a lot of things probably like I think for my first I don't know almost year I don't think anyone was reading it so like it was it's like a lot of these activities like you have to be doing it because you actually enjoy it because there was there was no like purpose beyond that because no one's reading it um I think it was actually one day Fred Wilson I know folks know him he's a he's a longtime blogger venture capitalist who's good friend and incred you know incredibly smart um and had a following and one day link to me because that was sort of the thing that happened you know you you'd hope someone would link to you and and uh you linked to me and I started getting some traffic and then I had I had to comment back then you'd have blogs with comment sections and I had this sort of community then I would be very active and responding to them um and it really became a fun thing I actually thought of it as like like I I tried to do I think WR a blog post a week and the way I would think about it is so I believe that especially on the internet people are very sensitive to authenticity and that if you don't if you write something that isn't authentic they can tell I don't know maybe I'm being overly optimistic and so my kind of personal challenge was uh to summarize an interesting thing I learned that week and to and so sort of I'd go through the week I'd hopefully have interesting conversations with people you know if I'm you know if I'm talking to interesting people and I'm thinking I would hopefully have like one new idea and then I would at the end of the week or sometime like that um try to write that idea down it was very you know very short often couple paragraphs sometimes I go longer it was a weird thing where i' learned that like probably The Sweet Spot was like four paragraphs and if I went too long it would actually get sort of less attention and Too Short you probably couldn't really State an idea so so it's really kind of like a concept like it' be like one concept um and um that was just a really I mean it was really fun um it was just like a you know kind of like learning in public I would say one thing that you're really good at that I want to learn from you is on liners come for the tools stay for the network the things that the basically the Nerds are doing now the smartest people will be doing in 10 years and that's what you would do you'd find a concept A phrase a sentence the next big thing starts out looking like a toy that was like a big one eight of those and you would focus on that you'd write that and the thing that helped you was I don't think you try to be too fancy you know you weren't like going down the lane doing some like crazy 360 through the leg slam dunk you're just like dropping it in every single week and it worked well for you you know I think I do think a lot of that was to do to my like what I was doing during the week though like like I remember come for the tool safe for the network I was like in a meeting and I was talking to an entrepreneur and I was explaining kind of this you know t for the tool State for the network as a is a strategy for building Network networks um for kind of getting adoption to for networks I can go into that if people want but um and I remember just having it was through you know sort of through the the the you know the yeah just the activity of having lots of conversations and at one point said I said that and I was like hey you know maybe I should call a blog post that and like um so I think it wouldn't have happened had I been sort of just sitting in a chair thinking of what's a clever phrase or something right it kind of came through intellectual sparring and look I one of the really I'm very fortunate in that the job I do is basically involves talking to smart people and so you're just sort of constantly refining ideas and building them right and so and and so I think that's some of where it came from um and then you know blogging has its n the nice thing about blogging I think people kind of underestimate is when you write something kind of boring or dumb maybe no one it's like it's sort of it's almost like a self-regulating machine because like no one pays attention to it so people are like you have all these great phrases well I wrote 500 blog posts and like 10 went viral and people remember those and and you're like you came you know there were 490 where I probably missed right you know but it's sort of this self right it's self-regulating in the sense that those don't get as popular and you were writing probably every at least around October 2010 maybe 2015 like those years sometime through then you were writing maybe every 10 to 14 days you were writing a lot that's probably right yeah I thought it was more like a week once a week but maybe yeah I know I counted at one point there were 500 blog posts over whatever the math is on that over uh um fouryear period of a lot and then kind of Switched unfortunately to Twitter and life jobs and life and everything else took you know you have this interesting idea about how Twitter is almost unserious and that if people could take writing more seriously in the way that you were doing it there's so much lwh hanging fruit here yeah no so let me qualify that like I think you know I I I think it's generally been a very positive thing that um the internet has democratized publishing that anyone has can now put something on the Internet and I think things like Twitter have been important and they made it really easy blogging when I did it you had to fiddle with like a website and RSS and there was just all this kind of stuff and then you had to build an audience and like you know one of the benefits of these modern social networks is they do kind of sometimes try to help you at least initially get you know through the algorithmic feed get an audience so that I don't want to be like overly negative but I do think that that um there is a lot of value in in sort of longer form writing and and both in the sense of just as a way to communicate ideas but I also think just career-wise like in my industry in the tech industry I think that a kind of a hack that is surp I to me is very surprisingly underused let's say you're a you know early in your career person who wants to who's interested in artificial intelligence and you want to build a profile as a kind of a thinker in that area to me the the shortest and um H you can I think in the course of two months you can become like a high-profile person if you write a bunch of interesting blog posts on the topic I don't think that happens this in the same way when you write like just a few sentences on Twitter and I think that that the ease of social media has lulled a lot of people into thinking that a video on Tik Tok or a tweet is the right way to kind of go out and share share their knowledge um when in fact you know the kind of stuff you talk about on the show and just you know actual writing of like a lot of ideas just simply cannot be stated in um short form in the right way like to to really kind of get the concept through um I I thought when I was blogging in you know in that period so like I guess 15 years ago now I thought I was just sort of had at the frontier of something and that of course like because it's so dramatically accelerated my career to to blog because it just suddenly you know I was in New York which you know the tech world is like like at the time was minor leagues right everything was in the Bay Area um I just you know I had a startup that I had sold but it was a security startup it wasn't super well known um and and through blogging was just able to you know sort of become part of the kind of Silicon Valley World eventually joined you know a big Silicon Valley firm and moved to California um and I contribute almost almost all of that to to writing um and so I assumed I was going to be at the FR at the frontier and then of course everyone else would figure this out and that it would just be this thing that people do and that like you building your career and your writing like this is just like the way to to show to stand out in an intellectual field right um but it it surprises me that it really hasn't ha happened to the extent that I expected it to I mean blogging is kind of we're you know um talking about it before the before the video um you know there's like Tyler Cowen and sort of these old school Fred Wilson and there's like some people that still kind of blog but for the most part like that that art form of like writing a page um or two pages um is certainly isn't as popular as one would expect given just how the explosion of social media I guess yeah when I look at your writing there's a real Simplicity to it a real practicality and I'm curious to hear how much of that is from your background as an engineer knowing languages like Python and then how much of it is from the the kind of writing that you did at Columbia yeah I I like I think a lot of it is um so I so I had a very I I had a fantastic I loved uh my experience since college for me it was just sort of this like Awakening um and you know in retrospect I don't think I knew how to write it's funny my parents are English were English professors and so you'd think I would know how to write but up and they used to make me write and things but but uh but actually when I look at it like one of the things they did in college was they they would go through with a red pen and just be like every little thing and one of the particular things they would do that I remember very clearly was they would write preten they had some shorthand for pretentious diction like whenever you CH chose a word that that could have been simpler this might have been a philosophy specific thing like choose a simpler word philosophers love to get crazy with that no and like and if you if you read the best philosophy um I in my opinion um you know just like take bur and Russell or something like one of these kind of classic philosophers or um um any of the um you know I I did analytic philosophy so you know that sort of for those who don't know like philosophy kind of forked you know around I don't know 1850s or something and there sort of fro Russell brickenstein and then a bunch of modern ones then there Continental philosophy which is like you know Hegel and the existentialists and things on the kind of more of the science and philosophy of mind and language and all that and and the in that that world the there there was a real um emphasis on Simplicity economy I think a lot of of my favorite philosophy books and essays they're really short there's almost no jargon there's almost no footnotes it's just like a pure ex like there's just a new like the best philosophy to my mind is like just a new idea it's just a brand new idea and once you express the idea it's like oh wow that's a new idea and then like maybe you tease out the implications of the idea but that's it it's just like a new idea right like you're in the idea business you're producing ideas you're sort of you think of it as a business you're supply chain it's like you're at the mouth of the river you're creating the new ideas and then Downstream people can take those ideas and Implement them in various ways but like real philosophy is like idea production right um anyway so that was very influential on me and and I and I always thought of like anytime you know there's a thing people do if they write like it's funny like a lot of people like they speak very well but then suddenly they write and it becomes formal have you seen this I was reviewing a job description that some people in our team at read a passage wrot yesterday and one of the things I've started doing is I review in Google Docs and a lot of times my comments in Google Docs are harsh so what I'll do is then I'll make a loom video after I got this from Yeah Tim Ferris said he did this when he came on the show and I was like I'm doing that yeah and the number one piece of feedback I said was you're writing like you're trying to write you're not writing like you're talking to just pretend that this person is right in front of you and you're trying to describe what they're doing at the job in five to eight bullet points 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even eight and just be super direct super clear and don't type this just go for a walk just say it it's very funny how that it's like it's almost like yeah it's almost like if you're not train it takes training to write like you speak it's it's a do you know the Miles Davis line on this he says uh jazz musician he says sometimes it takes a long time to be able to play like yourself that's great yeah so that's that's perfect yeah no that's that's right I think um and so that you know I don't know so I for me like it's just yes it took a long time to learn to play like myself to speak you know to speak in a I mean obviously you in in good writing you do it better right I'm like the things I'm spaying now like they aren't structured perfectly they aren't you know so you're sort of the best version of yourself right the the best version of the way you speak and has your voice and things does engineering factor into this because this to me is one of Sil Valley's big contributions to writing in general is Simplicity Clarity directness yeah maybe I think yeah I think there is this in engineering right there is this like there there is a emphasis on um economy you know economy modularity I mean my book my my editor would Jo he said one of The Eccentric things about my book is that well I chunked it into three to four so it's meant to be read cover to cover um but you can read it in three to four page chunks which is what Engineers would call modularity right like it's like each thing sort of stands alone um and also he thought it was eccentric my editor that I sometimes in many places will say uh refer to other sections like a hyperlink like a hyperlink which which I thought about removing but he thought it in the end I thought it was nice because that way you could jump around and see it but um yeah I don't know it's a good question I don't know I I I I can't really I think for myself I mean like it is symbol manipulation I think one of the things I like through the process of writing the book I think one of the interesting things for me writing the book was and I'm guessing this is true of a lot of other people is that my my ear my editing ability was far ahead of my writing ability huh is that not case for everyone else say more about that what I mean is like and this has always been I I think I've closed the Gap over the course of practicing what I mean is um I could I think for a long time I me I anyone who I read a lot and I assume you do I assume most of the viewers do and if you read a lot you you know your ear knows that like this is good writing this is bad writing and so like I have an I think I've had an ear for a long time to be able to say this is good bad writing bad writing as a writer my challenge has been I'll write something and I'll be like something is off but I don't know what it is right like I found that to be my CH and it therefore it was a very slow process writing like I'm talking about like when I blogged as an example like I would rewrite these things and I'd be like why is this off and you know and so one of the things that that like one of the things of actually writing a book that I found it dramatically improved on was fixing that feedback loop now when I see something's off I'm pretty quick at saying okay wait what what is it that I'm hearing that's off and how do I fix it it's because of the you know the the topic sentence is wrong the Claus is in the wrong place the you know the the word choice is wrong I think it's sort of like how you know what's wrong with all your friends lives but you don't really know what's wrong with your life and sometimes you can just see other people's writing clearly yeah and I think that there's a there might even be an ego thing attached with your own writing because here's something I found when I write something and I've just finished it I either think it's the worst thing ever or or the greatest thing ever and never in between I'm either like I want to marry this or I never want to see this again whereas then when I step away from it I have a bit more of a neutral objective view at what's good and bad and I don't think I have that emotional attachment with other people's writing so I can often look at it and just go these are the three things that need to change but my question for you is do you think that that awareness that understanding is a function of time or was it some insight that got unlocked in your mind that allowed you to see more clearly this is going back to your question engineering I mean in some sense I mean like writing like coding is symbol manipulation right you were manipulating symbols that that have certain now there's I think with with writing English you know or natural language um it's not of course just like code in the sense of like it just performs it's not just sort of purely utilitarian there's there's connotation and poetic evoc you know what does it evoke the emotional kind of quality qualities of it there's a um there there's a whole bunch of other aspects but at some level it is symbol manipulation and like you know really just I think it's just for me at least wrote practice of you know what something sounds off here oh it's you know passive too much passive voice the adjectives too many adjectives doing too much work I'm telling not showing I'm you know uh the transition is off and I need to fix the way the Clauses are stru red you know it just becomes a lot of tactical things of like how at least for me that was a lot of the you know just and just sheer practice I spent 12 months you know significant portion of 12 months um on the actual Act of writing this book um and just over and over and over and then like you know how to structure sections like um you know there's there's obviously there's classic techniques um I do a lot in this book I do kind of the classic rhetoric style in each section where it's um you know they'll sort of you'll have an intro that's kind of a more concrete maybe anecdote um you'll move into it moves into the main argument moves into the supporting um Arguments for the main the main proposition the supporting arguments uh sort of Steel Manning giving the best version of counterarguments answering those counterarguments and then sort of tying it back to the original the kind of the beginning and to show sort of show give the reader a sense of through that process both right like that that's a common I mean that would be sort of my default structure I I think if you do it too much it becomes formulaic but I think if you read a lot of the sections of the book like particularly if readers want to the we'll jump more into the book but like the last third of the book is all these is sort of these seven uh application areas um sort of different use cases for blockchains um and in those are each are each kind of Standalone sections and they all kind of follow roughly that kind of format um and that format I think is nice because it gives it has sort of an emotional element it has an intellectual element it you're showing all the counterarguments you're you know um if if presenting him in the strongest way uh being kind of intellectually honest and kind of going through everything and then sort of giving the reader a sense of progress through that the biggest challenge with this book is a lot of the ideas are abstract it requires some kind of prerequisite knowledge um but I wanted to make a book write a book that was you know entertaining to read and and backed up by by um you know data and stories and not just sort of abstractions right not like overly philosophical and so to the extent I could I tried to structure it somewhat chronologically and kind of go through the history of the internet um I think each chapter I thought of as its own kind of challenge in that how could I make it a big part of the challenge was how can I make it simpler and when you talk about really getting it down to be simple how did that happen was it looking at drafts was it rewriting paragraphs sentences sharing many yeah yeah many um oh yeah I mean I said thousands of iterations so I'll tell the the rough history of the book is I wrote a first kind of draft of the first kind of two-thirds of it like probably a month or two like you know and I just had I had something on paper um and then uh there were bunch of problems with it obviously one was um um it uh was was too abstract too much passive voice uh too much Reliance on tell not show like crutch words I'd call them adjectives adverbs so instead of you know I would say things like the ownership is a big digital ownership is a big Concept in the book and I would say things like genuine ownership and like the word genuine is doing a lot of work there like what does that mean right and so I basically or like block chains can make strong commitment strong is doing a lot of word work there like what does that mean um by the way I had a lot of readers I had you know I I work with a team of 80 people on my team and of that probably first of all I have guy Robert Hackett who's a former writer who's incredibly helpful to me I had um or he is a writer but he was a former journalist um uh I had uh 20 people on my team who did very thorough reads and like would give paragraph level comments yeah um like very paragraph like really like every almost every paragraph comments hey I don't buy this argument hey here's a counter argument hey this phrase didn't land for me did you give them their own Google Docs or have them all do I use mostly Google doc and I would I would basically like Fork the copy of the Google Doc and send it to them or something it was always this you know it's always this thing with writing where you have like the Master Copy and then like this version and then and then you're like trying to merge the 14 comments together and then you change 17 but you're actually on 23 I mean Google helps a lot I was using word for a little while and I hadn't used word in years and I was like they must be better now cuz I had used it in it's not better it's like I I thought it was just God awful but like like the fonts are all over the place and I don't even know what's going on in that thing but and you can't share you know and then I was trying to use word with Dropbox if you're having other people edit it and K trying to do Version Control I don't know maybe there's maybe I was doing it wrong but I just thought it was a nightmare problem with Google specifically though is once you get I kept hitting this kind of comment limit where it would just start acting buggy I think it was because I had so many comments and I would keep so I'd have to every two weeks copy and paste and create a new thing which is really annoying yeah like it was basic but like it was fine it was I mean it basically worked and it was fine um yeah so I sent it out so I done the first draft um one of the big problems with it like someone in a friendly way called it uh encyclopedic at times which was their their friendly way of saying kind of boring and not like basically there were sections where I was explaining stuff where I just kind of like list stuff right like there was no narrative form there was no structure there was no story um and so it's been a lot of time I think I basically I I actually think I like I'll give you an example like a chapter I really like is it's called software it's a community created software it's really about this concept composability and that was um that was a chapter it's a very abstract concept it's a very important concept um and I feel like that was one where like I really I spent a lot of time on that and finally nailed that one I feel like there a I feel generally like I did there's a few maybe I won't say which ones there's like two chapters that still I feel like I never kind of fully cracked um how to do in a way um in like the the full way I wanted to and you know I I had a lot of discussions about this with with with people that were helping me and in the end thought maybe okay maybe there's just some parts where you just simply have to kind of convey information I think a lot of the work of doing something like this is thinking through what sort of analogy or I do a lot of analogy you see like the city analogy comes back a lot right here you have composability okay refers to a property of software that allows smaller pieces to be assembled into larger compositions I'm like okay cuz I'm basically your target reader I'm fairly interested in this I feel like this is the sort of book that could interest me but I'm not like steeped in crypto but that section is called software is Lego bricks and now I'm like ah now I see that now I get it instantly and I feel like that was a lot of the work that you needed to do in this book that was another part was sectioning it like that like that I think the initial one it was chapters and it took me a long time to get it down to these two to three page sections to give them kind of nice simple titles by the way one of my North Stars here is everything is for the reader so there was nothing like like whenever there was a choice like do I put a chart how do I title this like what is simpler what is what is clear what is more for the reader you know like very little jargon in the book I I hope I don't think there's any jargon that's not I don't think there's any words that are not common words where I don't explain and Define them and I and I don't think there's that many of them so for example like in the blockchains people use the word decentralization a lot I almost never it probably occurs in the book but it's certainly not commonly occurs like everything is is TR tries to kind of how do we reduce it to Simplicity Simplicity um so and and so going back to the process so the um so okay so I had 20 readers or something um uh had a big rewrite I think it one of the best rewrites was I'm exaggerating a little bit but like removing every adjective adverb and I'm exaggerating a little bit but essentially it was like these things like strong ownership genuiness veryy the I don't think the word varies in the book I hope it isn't um maybe this is somewhere but if it is we'll burn it yeah but but like very like look techbooks like there's a thing where especially in techbooks where people try to Hype things up right and they use all of these uh superlatives and so I and I feel like every time there's like a word vary what that really means is I haven't explained it well enough because if I explain it well enough in a bunch of simple descriptive phrases um the reader will get it it's like it's very wow this is a better you know this this design is better than this design don't say that show them and like show the consequences and tell the stories and show how it affects people I say the same thing with exclamation points if somebody WR with an exclamation point they intuitively know that the language isn't strong enough and they're trying to compensate that's right and I think I agree with you and I think that there's I would say that there are subtler the the only twist I would put on what you just said is that there are there are words that act in the same way as an exclamation point right like and like and you need to look for the the crutch words as I'm calling them and so so that was a big change like passive voice and passive voice is not just a simple matter of switching it right it takes work because you're like wait who did that the internet was built to be a decentralized system that's not a good sentence what is a good sentence is you know Vince surf did this Tim bernees did the you know like what actually happened right so it's not just passive voice it's not like you can just you know plug it into chat GPT and say give me active voice like it means you need to go do the work of like what happened right like tell a story right um so that was a huge rewrite that was like a multi-month process then I had so I so sort of wrote the first draft did the kind of like these kind of rewrites like this had 20 really I thank them in the acknowledgement I there was about 20 people and some like some were General readers some were technologists we had a few lawyers because some legal c um and they went through the paragraph level and then I did all and I went through all of those and you know sometimes rejected the comments but mostly took them into account um I did another rewrite where I had I would call it kind of like um I would call it uh I was kind of defensive like I would bring up counterarguments to some of my arguments and then just sort of say they're wrong and then I did a rewrite which I think has really improved it which didn't change that so like there's a part it's in the take R section on on some of the objections like there's a Moxy Marlin spike is this repected security researcher has this kind of very I think intelligent re objection to some of my arguments um and the original version was sort of like here's his argument he's wrong and now it's actually here's his argument that's a good argument here are the design lessons one should take away from it right and I did that a lot throughout the book I really sort of said like what the network governance section which is sort of how do you control and govern Networks originally I was sort of making these claims of like now now with blockchains you can do much better governance and I finally realized like you know that's too strong a statement what blockchains really let you do is they let you have a much richer design space where you can design new governance systems but we haven't figured out the best way to do it and so I rewrote that to be so really really try to make it like you know to really support the claims and like show the weak points show where things are not figured out and like make it more honest and authentic I don't know not I I think that's a big problem with tech particularly Tech business books is that they don't do that and so I really wanted this book to be different and to be um to be just like honest descriptive simple declarative sentences no hype no I don't know hopefully that came through yeah it did well one of the things that you're so good at is onliners and my favorite new Chris Dix and oneliner in this is that blockchains go from uh don't be evil to can't be evil that's so good so tell me the story of that and do you like get excited when you find something like that cuz that's the sort of stuff that really sticks in people's bra that was so Google's famous so when they started they were supposed to be a different company than all the other tech companies and that they were going to be don't be evil that was their motto and I don't know you can debate I guess people could debate how Google is today I I certainly think they haven't lived up to that motto now and to look at the search results and everything else and like just the way the company behaves I I I'm very disappointed and so um so you know one of the promises of blockchains is that now you can you don't have to rely on corporate promises is and legal you know today how do you trust Google you're supposed to click through the 50 page privacy policy that pops up you know that have you ever read those or negotiated those like that's our current trust system on the internet like it's a it's a ridiculous system um or they you know the management promises don't be evil or something and one of the major benefits of a blockchain is you remove all that stuff and you simply encode you know in the in the blockchain code that's public and verifiable what the rules are what here's the rules of this social network here's the rules of this game here's the rules of this Marketplace and it's built in there and if and if the blockchain if you build in those you can build block good and bad blockchains like any technology you can build evil blockchains are good but if you build a good one you build it right the right one will have encoded in it that that you know its rules and ideally those rules are it it's not that you have to trust it to not be evil it cannot be evil right can't be evil so that's where the can't be evil comes from as you were thinking this title is really good that was debated a lot by other I I was always very adamant about that title but that was not always popular I think it's really good cuz I think that it has a few things going for it the first is it helps me remember the history that there was the readon era of the internet then we see the democratization of publishing that's where at now and then now we're moving into the ownership layer or the ownership time of the internet when we can actually have incentive structures and own a piece of these digital assets and you wrote a piece I think it's the oldest piece on your site on naming things it was about naming startups did and I went back and read it today yeah I mean like the the the there was debate like you know some of the people helping me were like does that is it too obscure people don't know what that means um you should it be called blockchains or web 3 or something um I I felt like this was an important name because as you said it really is about kind of the the history and the evolution and so for those who don't know the the the way I describe in the book is there sort of three years of the internet the read ER the WR ear and the own ear and I explain in detail like why those words you know are are used um but I also like that um it's just they're simple words to me that says I hope that signals accessibility yep like I want this to be accessible like that was my main thing with this book I want it to be anyone feels like they are welcome to read it like and they will understand it and I'm not and I'm not trying to you know I'm trying to include them not exclude them um I also feel like when I got the physical book I just got the first one like two weeks ago I was I feel like I it's hard for me to look at this subjectively but I feel like when I glance through it they're like short relatively simple words not a lot of jargon it feels like you know there's not a lot of I actually like random hous style a lot if they they their um house style they removed a lot of punctuation H which I liked actually in retos like it just reads more like a novel or something they pick this font which actually there's cute little page end where it describes guy from 1722 they put this in there but I liked it it was like it was like look that's a nice it looks like an old Scot style font like with the picture on the cover this was this great artist H it's so indulgent this this book was set in in castlin a tight face first designed in 1722 by William castlin it's so indulgent the Roman is considered a Workhorse type face due to its pleasant open appearance well the italic is exceedingly decorative it's so funny also as a contrast you did not write that no no random put that in there and I I thought it was kind of endearing and so I didn't say anything I mean I assume that's like something we do have to credit the fond or something I think it's great I think it's so funny especially as a contrast to the rest of the book yeah but um do most books don't have the font thing I don't know where that came I never asked random about exceedingly decorative you could write for a thousand years and never put those two words together I do like the font I think it looks you know when I look at the book Maybe This Is My Philosophy background it feels like a kind of a philosophy book like an older school book and like I wanted the cover to be kind of like the this this's this really great artist who did the cover he did a bunch of covers and chose that one but um just so you know so feel like a accessible kind of book and not like kind of heavy jargon book and so but uh my agent called the book he called rewrite nomic which is like you know kind of mysterious M you know like kind of like you hear read write on what is that you know kind of cryptic I guess I don't know we'll see how was we've spoken about your short blog post four paragraphs spoke about a book how is writing something like this different from what I think is a masterful piece how created the computer which you put in the Atlantic 2018 or so how was that piece different from writing a book well the big thing with the book I mean look it's the obvious part with the book is I mean obviously it's longer and it takes more time but that actually has it's not just the length right because what happens with the length is that you have so a couple things like I found that I could only reread the book every two weeks or so um in the sense of so like one of the hard things with the book that's not hard in the blog post right is like repetition and Omission like did I say that already mhm right right and like has that concept been explained like now on page 60 I'm picking up an idea on page 30 like is that too far away um you know did I explain it fully did I am I repeating it I had a lot in a lot of drafts I had a lot to way too much repetition like let me re-explain composability and like you know and and so but is it too much repetition or is it too far away can you refer back to it like you kind of have to have a fresh read to do that right that's what I mean by every two weeks if I read it to I could read it again like whatever it takes six hours to read a book or I don't know what it takes but like but I couldn't read it fresh right I couldn't read it with fresh eyes and so I wouldn't be able to spot the repetition and things so I found that like for example I had to wait two weeks and so I had this whole process where like in those two weeks I would sort of hack away on like one section and sort of try to figure out a section um and then you know I figure out I mean how to structure it how to make it compelling how to um simplify the ideas I spent a lot of time I sort of think of the WR for me writing this book was a two it was sitting in front of the computer and then there was like I would do it often when I exercise of like how can I chop down the concepts to make it simpler simpler simpler simpler my my own personal process is I will wake up early in the morning um I always usually work better in the morning I get like three or four good hours in me and then I'm probably not creative anymore um and we write and you know in front of a computer and actually do the writing and then um I often find that there's sort of a naughty conceptual problem like a not KN and O naughty naughty sorry um oh you're being so naughty today you're so um there's like a naughty conceptual problem and um and then that's for me like I I had a lot of these like what was the um there are particular sections at the end there's one on finance and there's one on social networking and like those were just killed me like I went I probably did 50 iterations of those and just kept thinking over and over of like what's the right way to frame this what's the right you know um and um and and so yeah would go and and you know and like whenever things feel jumbled I always feel like it's I'm missing the right distinction the right concept and like once I figure out the right concept oh that will right that it will all just sort of fall into place like I sort of feel like everything should be simple and if it's not simple then I haven't thought about it enough right yeah well I found a few things so something I see all the time is that I'll be writing but I'm just my fingertips are moving but I'm don't have that same intentionality and when there's that muck that's coming out of me I often don't know the core thing that I'm trying to say so when you say there's a lot of things that you've just been given yep you've been given a structure the first the beginning will be come for the tool the second will be stay for the network you'll probably have a few examples there that show what's going on and then when you edit if something doesn't go back to that one sentence you're like I'm going to cut this yeah that's right over and over again what'll happen is I'll be super stuck and I'll go I'll talk to a friend and I'll explain it to them and then they'll say come for the tool stay for the network that's what you're trying to say and often I get it socratically what that one liner is what that answer is yeah I mean speaking to people is a ma you know going out often for me the Log Jam will break of just like going out having conversations like getting out of your element you know time fixes it but but I always feel like yeah if it's not super simple like I haven't I haven't thought about it enough right it has to be so broken down um but going back to the if you want want to finish on the process the um so I went through had 20 people you know did the did the remove the crutch words remove the adjectives um steal man the counterarguments you know all of that had 20 people um critique it went through all I took two weeks off of work we have this break in the summer and I just took it off and rented house on the beach and just like literally all alone for 2 weeks worked on that going through all the comments and then okay and then I thought okay this is getting good and then I went and did a fresh read and I was horrified because I was like basically I had um gone through and done all these comments but now the structure was all ruined right because it was just like I had just sort of like layered over all of these different things and it was just a mess and I was like how could I and I was actually kind of scary in a way not scary but like it was just a little bit disturbing because I was just so far I thought I was getting close to being done and I was like wow this is really just not structured right so then I had to do I hate that moment I mean the word that the word that came to mind was despair I've had moments when I thought I was really close and somebody says hey man it's just not good enough and there's something about restructuring what I find so interesting about structure is have you heard the line about painters that the yeah exactly people who are outside of painting they talk about you know Form and Function and people who are inside of the world of painting they talk about where to find cheap turpentine I think it's such a good line and I think it's the same thing with writing that writers always talk about structure because as writers we know that once you find the structure the content it actually just Falls follows from that and a really good structure is invisible a really good structure seems obvious but I know that that is the work and to go back to this moment the reason I feel a sense of Despair is because I know how much work has just comes back to just taking this putting it here taking that putting it there and then I can only even imagine in the in a project the size of a book trying to basically know what state the reader has in their mind that's the hardest part that's the hardest part the hardest part for me I mean there's million hard parts book but um but yes like they're now on page 190 this is the average reader like what are they thinking what's clear to them what isn't and so what I the other thing I found like is that having the 20 readers um was of course invaluable because they just know stuff I don't know and you know would just say smart things but also the way I've come to think me this is we're we talking before the video about George Saunders this book um a swim in the pond swim in the pond that was a great book I read that after I wrote after I wrote the book I've read I've I've been on a reading binge more than I've ever been since I finished the book about four months ago I think partly because I appreciate books more I I've always like books but and I also read a bunch of books about writing um but I he has some line in there about I'm GNA butcher it but it's essentially like you you kind of think of it as like I you're reading my you're reading the book and then in your mind it's really an interactive process right you're you're the reader is now processing what you wrote but then also thinking of counterarguments and if I don't if I the writer don't you know if you read five paragraphs and you thought of five counterarguments and I don't address them at some point you're going to stop reading the book you're going to be like this person's just off on a different branch of the world right um and so how do you know kind of what branch they're going down and what they're thinking right I I think that you can try to guess and anticipate it but I don't think there's any substitute for having readers who who are good readers who give you that feedback and they'd be like well this is not but like I don't get this I'm thinking this here's my counterargument like so that was the other thing of having and maybe 20s I don't know 20 is the right number I mean at some point it becomes imposs unwieldly and how many people can you really ask to do you know like amongst editors right there probably a power law I mean there's different levels this there's the copy edits and then there's hey I think that you can rejigger this but every now and then I'll get a comment where somebody can see the most fundamental layer of what it is that I'm saying they can see that I'm saying something that I haven't even explicitly said and they can say if you can take this and change it to that everything else falls into place that's great and those editors big UNL yeah hard to find yeah that's interesting so so that was anyway so that so then and then so then I had to refactor it and that was the next four months and then there was just all the details I can't believe how many details how much time I mean there's like you know acknowledgements and this and that and foot oh the index and the you know we have it's a nice index the random house did a lot of that the um end notes checking the end notes I hired a outside separate fact Checker oh tell me about that yeah yeah so this great woman War Fox who um has sort of experienced at a bunch of magazines and things and um like I this is a controversial topic I know that it's going to get fact checked by the world and so I said look let me just go do you know go crazy No Limits just like find any mistakes in the book and as a by she did and she found you know like I like I Liv through a lot of this so like it was directionally correct but of course you know I had did some dates wrong I had some attributions wrong and she fixed all that and corrected me um but ALS also she found some great um as a byproduct found some great quotes um like there's a like so in the so it's called rewrite own and in the 2000s there was this thing you know people called the web 2 movement of sort of the social media movement but actually at the time it was actually called the read write movement was a very common thing yeah this is not read WR is not my phrase um and and but I wasn't and I sort of wanted to say that and sort of say hey like this read write own I'm adding the own to it but I'm not making up the read write like this that that history of like the read era the read write era that is a common take on it La MOA found this great quote from this very popular blog called the read right web that was like the manifesto of that web that I put in the book which sort of you know as an example so so HED an outside fact Checker um uh and researcher um you know had I had some help with like the charts and stuff that all took forever you know that's all been very carefully vetted um there's some data and other things in there um so anyways just graphic design book is a quite a process for those who are watching if they're thinking about going through it but I want to go back to a moment early in your life when I think that you realize the benefits of writing you wrote a letter to Alan K oh did I have that in my blog I don't know where I found that yeah I think I maybe I blogged about that once that's funny really influence you I forget how I found it when I was a kid I used to write letters and um I don't know why um but uh I used to like write physical letters this is you know I was the ' 80s so it's was before like the internet or whatever and or the internet existed but not in its modern form um and yeah and I was living in Ohio in a small town in Springfield Ohio like relatively small town um and was really into computers and I got um I guess it was an Apple at the time I think it was tar or apple um and had no and there was again it was sort of early you know very pre pre- browser and everything um and so I had no computer manual so I wrote a letter to I think it was to Apple um and I said I'm I said I am this whatever I guess I was you know 11year old kid or something in Ohio and I'm really into programming and I don't have see at the time this I don't know if anyone's going to be interest in this but at the time there was like this computers were like this mystical thing because you couldn't go Google it you couldn't do whatever and like it literally like there was a like the Apple 2 had like 64k of memory and each memory location would do have different things it would do and almost nobody would know what they do unless you had like the original manual so yeah I wrote a letter and it got a letter back from I wish I saved it from Alan K who's a famous researcher and they sent me this giant box of books it was a it was I don't where did you see that that's funny must have put that in a blog post somewhere but um I don't know it's actually remarkable I think people could still do it today like I think if you just write nice letters to the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies I bet you you will get a 99% success rate um in fact I know you will because they all I will tell you now I'll skip ahead to the secret which is they all have offices of the CEO who basically will if a kid writes a letter they will say do it and it works partly They al will respond because they it actually doesn't happen that often they get like these angry like craze letters and they don't they don't you know they just send those off to legal or something but if you write a friendly respectful letter uh particularly if you're a kid cute kid who might end up in the Press like they will they will give you a tour of a 737 yeah all right Chris what I want to do is I want to switch the the focus of this conversation into business models for writers but I want to start off with why you chose to write a book you have a tweet from 2014 where you say most business books exist because the book format still has cultural gravitas bloggers don't appear on Charlie Rose or get reviewed by the New York Times and that I think that's true and that's part of why I wrote a book and I also say by the way as a funny side um I think people because I run a fund and I'm a business person people expect this to be kind of a book that's like well one is a lot of people have said did you write the book um like and in fact I've gotten from entrepreneur they just assume you don't write the book because most people that do what I do don't write books um number one and then number two if you do write a book it's like seven ways to be successful or something it's sort of a you know howto sort of type of thing and it's definitely not that type of book um and so um so anyway so that just kind of a funny aside but um um and I and I and I do think most business books are not good for that Reon like the problem with business books generally is they aren't often they aren't written by the person or if they are written by the person most business people are under high a lot of constraints um about what they can say so like I've read a lot of business books and like I won't name names but like there was one that business book that when I was talking to Publishers and agents were like oh you should read this business book and so you know we think this is a good one and I read it and I was like you know I can see why they think it's good it sold a lot of copies but it's fake and I know it's fake because it was a book about a bunch of projects that the person worked on and and I've been involved with a bunch of projects in my life and I will tell you something about projects when you have a project that's involves let's say 100 people that's creating something they creating like a startup or you know creative project uh they are [ __ ] shows every project that involves a lot of people over a long period of time is a giant series of [ __ ] shows cluster [ __ ] like whatever that maybe work out in the end okay I can confirm so if you read a book that is about somebody's creative processes and it doesn't involve that it's not authentic okay and so like one book that would be fun to write would be a book about like startups and what actually happened the problem with that book is I can't write that book right and and no business person probably can unless they're quitting the industry forever because it's going to be a bunch of like there's just a bunch of stuff that's not my place to say of like stuff that went wrong right um and it really isn't my place maybe you could write like a you know like a yeah I don't know like you just it's so you know Mark Andrian said about this I asked him what is it what is a book that you would want to write and he and he goes I'd write a Raman cleff and I'm like I don't know what a ran is book in Disguise and he goes yeah so it's a book in Disguise where everything that happened actually happened but all the names dates and events have been changed yeah yeah that's I think that's that would be the that would probably be the honest Business book right um or you kind of go like I did and sort of go up a level of abstraction and don't you know I don't go into all the messy details but there's a lot of stuff I learned from those messy details right um and so so I think like I just to think a lot of business books for that either they can't tell the truth because they're under constraints or they don't really write the book and so that was I think part of my tweet was referring to is like why just skip all of that stuff and write a generally my view has been write a blog post now the advantage of a book and why I wrote a book is a couple of fold one I really felt strongly in this case that this that what I say in this book simply could not be compressed any further like I believe this is a highly compressed it's 213 Pages main text I think that's right roughly um that um that goes through the history of the internet explains blockchains explains you know gives a bunch of future applications covers a lot of ground I hope it does it in a way that's understandable but you know it's compressed like it can't be made into a series of blog posts number one number two yes to the point of that tweet I to agree with that books have this ability I think to cross over into a different kind of Realm of I mean a book is in some way like there's different ways to look at a book right it's a it's obviously you know um there's the physical book and the things written in it but it's also kind of a um container for a meme container I was going to say a normie IPO it's a meme it's a meme delivery vehicle right it's like a CD delivers a movie it delivers a meme yeah and you just see like books like actually I was really shocked and kind of depressed to look at the book sales figures when I started this project that books just don't sell I mean I'm look I'm used to the internet like we have small we you know some hobbyist website will get a milli million views and like I think the bestselling kind of non-romance nonfiction book last year was like 400,000 copies or five you know like should have written a romance now yeah Ro apparently romantic is what I'm told is the thing it's fantasy mut romance is like the hot thing so if this read write on doesn't work out that's but um but um but you know so look I mean but but that said like if you think about it how many books have there been that have had profound you know like the ideas have spread very far number one I think the other really cool thing about books is there did you see um the new spiderverse movie The spiderverse 2 no I'm not a big superhero movie I've checked out of the Marvel stuff no it's not Marvel no it's the cartoon this is cartoon ones it's totally different I I agree I don't watch Marvel but the spider verse is like this very creative cartoon thing anyways but they have um they have this idea of they call it so it's like this Multiverse and the world splits but there's this thing called Canon event and a Canon event is an event that's so important in your life that in any version of the multi reverse um it it it is it persists so like in Spider-Man's case getting bit by the spider that has to be sort of essential to his character and everything anyway so Canon and then and the reason I mentioned it is now become a thing on Tik Tok people talk about their Canon events okay it's like an internet meme now okay so anyways the other thing I think is interesting about books is that they can create Canon events right so maybe only this will I don't know how many people will read this book maybe it's you know not as many as read my blog post or something because it's just the nature of books but I think that what I hope is 10 years from now there'll be somebody comes up to me and like you know they created some great product or idea or something invention and they say you know that book was a Canon event like books can be Canon they can have that kind of impact on a relatively small group of people so I think there's two I think one is they can propagate memes in a way that that um and just sort of affect the cultural Z guys the you know just just just introduce ideas to the sort of broader World in a way that blog posts and podcast it's harder for them much harder for them to and then two I think on specific people like I think about my own life like my career my life was changed by various books like I the reason I got into philosophy was a bunch of sort of Gateway books that were kind of computer science meets philosophy and like um I think that's true with a lot of people that like so so that that to me is the power of a book and I wanted to do that um but ultimately for me it was this idea that I you know I I felt well I let me say one other thing which is I have worked in technology for 25 years and generally I found there's some gap between the what I see is quote the re what I view as the reality of a technology and the public perception of it um however the Gap is not that wide in this case I think the Gap is just absolutely massive so there's this you know crypto is like scams and casinos and FTX and I view and and that exists and I think that's a perversion kind of co-option of the real technology I view blockchains as the most important invention for potentially returning the internet to its original ideals okay so I view it just just the gap between the two is so wide that and that that kind of like look when all a lot of bad stuff happened like the FTX crash and just a bunch of like scams and other things like two years ago like that was upsetting and at first I was like this is depressing like this gap between like what I see as like this very important new way to build networks and that have all these positive benefits that's um and and perception of it is scams and you know all this other speculation um and at first I kind of felt sorry for myself or whatever depressed about it and then I said you know what this is actually the greatest opportunity in my career to write a book like what if you could close that Gap and actually after writing this book I was like that was kind of fun maybe I should write another book and then every idea I think of like they're okay but I'm like wow that was a really like I there's nothing I see that has that kind of Gap like there is such a gap I basically guarantee you that Anyone who reads this will find will have a new it is a different view of the internet than they are told it's a different history of the internet I think it's a completely coherent and fully argued view of it I'm not expecting everyone to like read it and immediately be converted but I do think they will come away from it saying okay that is a well I think an honest read is that is a well-thought out different view of the world I think that this is a good teaching moment because I spend so much time talking to people who come to me and say what should I write about what should I write about and Bezos has a line where he says your profit margin is my opportunity your margin is my opportunity and what I always say back to people is their ignorance is your opportunity what's the most misunderstood thing what is the most misunderstood thing what is something that you look at the world and you say people think this that is wrong I know why and I'm going to argue for something else I great advice that's how I felt like I felt with this book I mean I can't tell you how clear I mean obviously I wrote the book but even before I wrote the book like I I spent my whole life career doing this so I mean obviously but like I I am like looking at this you know thing in front of me and I see it so clearly and it's just like everything I see in the world is through this lens and the internet I mean people spend seven hours day on internet I spend at least that many hours like it's a lot big part of my life and I view it through a certain lens and very few other people view it through that lens and I feel like it's a fully worked out full world viw fully defensible you know kind of lens of the on the world um and it's just like it kind of drives you crazy in a way because it's like it does why doesn't why doesn't everyone else see it that way um and so to your I agree with you to your point like I mean now there's an interesting followup right which is are you and actually I I actually to be totally candid like until I wrote the book part of I reason I wrote the book was to test myself I'm like I feel like this is just like the world's wrong and I'm right right like is everyone crazy or am I crazy um but the way to really prove it is to write it out in a way that like by the way Bezos talks about this too and I think he's right like why is there no PowerPoints at Amazon cuz PowerPoints let you kind of lead or skip over sloppy sloppy thinking writing one of the many virtues of writing right is it forces you to see all the steps to show your work and so for me partly also the book was a personal test of like am I crazy like my my view of the world is so different than most people's am I crazy or are they crazy right and I'm like I will tell you now I don't believe I'm crazy so like I've now written it out in a very um you know like detailed stepbystep kind of argument kind of way um and uh and and so yeah so part of it was a test of that but but I think that advice you give is great I think I think kind of what is your you know this Peter teal has this concept of what is your secret tot you familiar with this so like the basic idea is um you know if you I have a startup idea my startup idea is I'm going to create an iPhone with longer battery life okay that's not a good startup idea why because it's not a secret because apple is everyone knows that's a useful product apple is probably got a lab of 10,000 people I don't know a thousand people working with batteries and making iPhones longer 01:0:0,950 --> 01:0:3,240 01:0:0,960 --> 01:0:4,520 lives right most startups involve 01:0:3,230 --> 01:0:4,520 01:0:3,240 --> 01:0:5,720 something kind of counterintuitive 01:0:4,510 --> 01:0:5,720 01:0:4,520 --> 01:0:8,359 there's something that's what he means 01:0:5,710 --> 01:0:8,359 01:0:5,720 --> 01:0:10,319 by a secret right um that you know it 01:0:8,349 --> 01:0:10,319 01:0:8,359 --> 01:0:12,880 turns out people do want to all get on 01:0:10,309 --> 01:0:12,880 01:0:10,319 --> 01:0:14,119 the internet and socialize and do this 01:0:12,870 --> 01:0:14,119 01:0:12,880 --> 01:0:15,440 and this is sort of Mark Zuckerberg 01:0:14,109 --> 01:0:15,440 01:0:14,119 --> 01:0:18,720 secret right at the time it didn't seem 01:0:15,430 --> 01:0:18,720 01:0:15,440 --> 01:0:20,599 like an obvious behavior um that you 01:0:18,710 --> 01:0:20,599 01:0:18,720 --> 01:0:24,039 know Bill Gates that at the time 01:0:20,589 --> 01:0:24,039 01:0:20,599 --> 01:0:26,240 Hardware was the business model of um of 01:0:24,029 --> 01:0:26,240 01:0:24,039 --> 01:0:27,480 computer companies everyone knew that 01:0:26,230 --> 01:0:27,480 01:0:26,240 --> 01:0:29,160 the way you make money is you sell 01:0:27,470 --> 01:0:29,160 01:0:27,480 --> 01:0:30,280 machines he said no I'm going to make 01:0:29,150 --> 01:0:30,280 01:0:29,160 --> 01:0:34,000 money selling software that was 01:0:30,270 --> 01:0:34,000 01:0:30,280 --> 01:0:35,680 contrarian right um and so you know so 01:0:33,990 --> 01:0:35,680 01:0:34,000 --> 01:0:37,200 and and Peter T would also say I think I 01:0:35,670 --> 01:0:37,200 01:0:35,680 --> 01:0:38,599 think he talked about an earned secret 01:0:37,190 --> 01:0:38,599 01:0:37,200 --> 01:0:42,400 so like you have like you don't just 01:0:38,589 --> 01:0:42,400 01:0:38,599 --> 01:0:44,240 come to the secret um you know just like 01:0:42,390 --> 01:0:44,240 01:0:42,400 --> 01:0:46,280 walking on the street and discover that 01:0:44,230 --> 01:0:46,280 01:0:44,240 --> 01:0:47,920 like people want software right like 01:0:46,270 --> 01:0:47,920 01:0:46,280 --> 01:0:49,559 came through like he was programming he 01:0:47,910 --> 01:0:49,559 01:0:47,920 --> 01:0:51,319 was building stuff he was seeing it and 01:0:49,549 --> 01:0:51,319 01:0:49,559 --> 01:0:53,680 he was sort of he sort of you know had 01:0:51,309 --> 01:0:53,680 01:0:51,319 --> 01:0:55,520 it takes it takes time and to your point 01:0:53,670 --> 01:0:55,520 01:0:53,680 --> 01:0:57,799 I I think that 01:0:55,510 --> 01:0:57,799 01:0:55,520 --> 01:0:59,160 that that I'm not sure that's the only 01:0:57,789 --> 01:0:59,160 01:0:57,799 --> 01:1:2,880 reason to write a book but I think 01:0:59,150 --> 01:1:2,880 01:0:59,160 --> 01:1:4,400 certainly one good way to think about 01:1:2,870 --> 01:1:4,400 01:1:2,880 --> 01:1:6,480 what to write about is like sort of what 01:1:4,390 --> 01:1:6,480 01:1:4,400 --> 01:1:8,000 is your earned secret right what do you 01:1:6,470 --> 01:1:8,000 01:1:6,480 --> 01:1:9,599 know about the world I think I think I'm 01:1:7,990 --> 01:1:9,599 01:1:8,000 --> 01:1:12,520 just rephrasing what you said by the way 01:1:9,589 --> 01:1:12,520 01:1:9,599 --> 01:1:14,319 I think um is that that that's 01:1:12,510 --> 01:1:14,319 01:1:12,520 --> 01:1:16,599 counterintuitive that's different that 01:1:14,309 --> 01:1:16,599 01:1:14,319 --> 01:1:18,960 for some reason because of my life 01:1:16,589 --> 01:1:18,960 01:1:16,599 --> 01:1:20,880 experience you know I know and is not 01:1:18,950 --> 01:1:20,880 01:1:18,960 --> 01:1:22,960 obvious to everybody else of course you 01:1:20,870 --> 01:1:22,960 01:1:20,880 --> 01:1:26,640 were talking earlier 01:1:22,950 --> 01:1:26,640 01:1:22,960 --> 01:1:29,520 about almost let men in the way that the 01:1:26,630 --> 01:1:29,520 01:1:26,640 --> 01:1:32,480 internet has not turned out to 01:1:29,510 --> 01:1:32,480 01:1:29,520 --> 01:1:35,160 be this utopian ideal in the way that we 01:1:32,470 --> 01:1:35,160 01:1:32,480 --> 01:1:38,240 thought and for me the one that just 01:1:35,150 --> 01:1:38,240 01:1:35,160 --> 01:1:40,559 breaks my heart is that there aren't as 01:1:38,230 --> 01:1:40,559 01:1:38,240 --> 01:1:42,559 many profitable niches as I think there 01:1:40,549 --> 01:1:42,559 01:1:40,559 --> 01:1:45,760 could be especially in the intellectual 01:1:42,549 --> 01:1:45,760 01:1:42,559 --> 01:1:48,520 sphere yeah the platonic ideal of the 01:1:45,750 --> 01:1:48,520 01:1:45,760 --> 01:1:50,200 internet that I want to spend my at 01:1:48,510 --> 01:1:50,200 01:1:48,520 --> 01:1:51,839 least the next decade 01:1:50,190 --> 01:1:51,839 01:1:50,200 --> 01:1:55,559 fostering 01:1:51,829 --> 01:1:55,559 01:1:51,839 --> 01:1:58,279 is fixing this problem where we have all 01:1:55,549 --> 01:1:58,279 01:1:55,559 --> 01:2:0,559 these domain experts who haven't shared 01:1:58,269 --> 01:2:0,559 01:1:58,279 --> 01:2:3,200 their ideas written them and published 01:2:0,549 --> 01:2:3,200 01:2:0,559 --> 01:2:5,880 them for other people to know and 01:2:3,190 --> 01:2:5,880 01:2:3,200 --> 01:2:8,000 understand and then it doesn't just help 01:2:5,870 --> 01:2:8,000 01:2:5,880 --> 01:2:10,079 the general public their readers it also 01:2:7,990 --> 01:2:10,079 01:2:8,000 --> 01:2:12,599 helps the domain experts and what I want 01:2:10,069 --> 01:2:12,599 01:2:10,079 --> 01:2:15,720 to be helping people do is I call this 01:2:12,589 --> 01:2:15,720 01:2:12,599 --> 01:2:17,520 your core idea take those domain experts 01:2:15,710 --> 01:2:17,520 01:2:15,720 --> 01:2:20,559 who've been working in a field for 20 01:2:17,510 --> 01:2:20,559 01:2:17,520 --> 01:2:22,240 years what is that idea that you know is 01:2:20,549 --> 01:2:22,240 01:2:20,559 --> 01:2:23,760 true what is that story that you need to 01:2:22,230 --> 01:2:23,760 01:2:22,240 --> 01:2:27,319 tell that message that you need to 01:2:23,750 --> 01:2:27,319 01:2:23,760 --> 01:2:29,640 spread now let me help you find polish 01:2:27,309 --> 01:2:29,640 01:2:27,319 --> 01:2:32,119 distribute that core idea because when 01:2:29,630 --> 01:2:32,119 01:2:29,640 --> 01:2:33,359 we talk about what the internet could be 01:2:32,109 --> 01:2:33,359 01:2:32,119 --> 01:2:36,520 what the internet should be what the 01:2:33,349 --> 01:2:36,520 01:2:33,359 --> 01:2:39,559 internet will be if we get this right 01:2:36,510 --> 01:2:39,559 01:2:36,520 --> 01:2:41,000 will be this explosion of information 01:2:39,549 --> 01:2:41,000 01:2:39,559 --> 01:2:42,680 because people are sharing their domain 01:2:40,990 --> 01:2:42,680 01:2:41,000 --> 01:2:44,760 expertise why aren't they doing that 01:2:42,670 --> 01:2:44,760 01:2:42,680 --> 01:2:46,760 today in your view a few reasons first 01:2:44,750 --> 01:2:46,760 01:2:44,760 --> 01:2:48,400 of all I think writing is a very good 01:2:46,750 --> 01:2:48,400 01:2:46,760 --> 01:2:51,160 way to do it and writing is hard you 01:2:48,390 --> 01:2:51,160 01:2:48,400 --> 01:2:52,520 were talking earlier about these people 01:2:51,150 --> 01:2:52,520 01:2:51,160 --> 01:2:54,400 run businesses they have a bunch of 01:2:52,510 --> 01:2:54,400 01:2:52,520 --> 01:2:56,640 Demand on their time I think that's the 01:2:54,390 --> 01:2:56,640 01:2:54,400 --> 01:2:58,559 first thing the second is what I call a 01:2:56,630 --> 01:2:58,559 01:2:56,640 --> 01:3:0,880 cold start distribution problem which 01:2:58,549 --> 01:3:0,880 01:2:58,559 --> 01:3:6,880 I'm getting excited about solving which 01:3:0,870 --> 01:3:6,880 01:3:0,880 --> 01:3:9,000 is say that I take a VP at a relatively 01:3:6,870 --> 01:3:9,000 01:3:6,880 --> 01:3:10,839 successful Corporation and they've been 01:3:8,990 --> 01:3:10,839 01:3:9,000 --> 01:3:13,240 working at this company for 25 years 01:3:10,829 --> 01:3:13,240 01:3:10,839 --> 01:3:14,480 they're an they're an expert in let's 01:3:13,230 --> 01:3:14,480 01:3:13,240 --> 01:3:18,160 call it 01:3:14,470 --> 01:3:18,160 01:3:14,480 --> 01:3:20,720 Telco how does Jane how does she write a 01:3:18,150 --> 01:3:20,720 01:3:18,160 --> 01:3:22,240 great piece and she needs support with 01:3:20,710 --> 01:3:22,240 01:3:20,720 --> 01:3:23,960 that and we can give her that at right 01:3:22,230 --> 01:3:23,960 01:3:22,240 --> 01:3:26,039 of passage but then the second thing is 01:3:23,950 --> 01:3:26,039 01:3:23,960 --> 01:3:28,359 how do she get that idea out there yeah 01:3:26,029 --> 01:3:28,359 01:3:26,039 --> 01:3:30,319 she doesn't have an audience she doesn't 01:3:28,349 --> 01:3:30,319 01:3:28,359 --> 01:3:33,680 have reach but what I want to figure out 01:3:30,309 --> 01:3:33,680 01:3:30,319 --> 01:3:36,200 how to do is how can I take anybody and 01:3:33,670 --> 01:3:36,200 01:3:33,680 --> 01:3:38,640 get them to write one article that 01:3:36,190 --> 01:3:38,640 01:3:36,200 --> 01:3:41,680 changes their life and I think that the 01:3:38,630 --> 01:3:41,680 01:3:38,640 --> 01:3:43,200 distribution problem is challenging and 01:3:41,670 --> 01:3:43,200 01:3:41,680 --> 01:3:44,880 a lot of the narrative from the last 01:3:43,190 --> 01:3:44,880 01:3:43,200 --> 01:3:46,960 decade or so which I actually think was 01:3:44,870 --> 01:3:46,960 01:3:44,880 --> 01:3:48,960 right is you need to write consistently 01:3:46,950 --> 01:3:48,960 01:3:46,960 --> 01:3:50,279 and I'm beginning to think how do I do 01:3:48,950 --> 01:3:50,279 01:3:48,960 --> 01:3:53,240 it with one 01:3:50,269 --> 01:3:53,240 01:3:50,279 --> 01:3:54,319 piece yeah yeah that there is this Rich 01:3:53,230 --> 01:3:54,319 01:3:53,240 --> 01:3:55,680 GE richer problem right and the 01:3:54,309 --> 01:3:55,680 01:3:54,319 --> 01:3:56,880 consistency is critical to building up 01:3:55,670 --> 01:3:56,880 01:3:55,680 --> 01:3:58,520 the audience because if you just pop 01:3:56,870 --> 01:3:58,520 01:3:56,880 --> 01:4:0,880 about one great article where you're 01:3:58,510 --> 01:4:0,880 01:3:58,520 --> 01:4:3,559 going to place it maybe you get it in a 01:4:0,870 --> 01:4:3,559 01:4:0,880 --> 01:4:5,400 existing publication but otherwise if 01:4:3,549 --> 01:4:5,400 01:4:3,559 --> 01:4:7,319 you have no social media following how 01:4:5,390 --> 01:4:7,319 01:4:5,400 --> 01:4:8,680 do you get it out there how do people 01:4:7,309 --> 01:4:8,680 01:4:7,319 --> 01:4:11,160 know about it it's very hard and I 01:4:8,670 --> 01:4:11,160 01:4:8,680 --> 01:4:13,480 talked to so many smart people I can't 01:4:11,150 --> 01:4:13,480 01:4:11,160 --> 01:4:16,119 believe it people who listeners you 01:4:13,470 --> 01:4:16,119 01:4:13,480 --> 01:4:17,559 would know their names and we respect 01:4:16,109 --> 01:4:17,559 01:4:16,119 --> 01:4:18,559 the heck out of them and I talk to them 01:4:17,549 --> 01:4:18,559 01:4:17,559 --> 01:4:21,119 and they're like oh I'm not a good 01:4:18,549 --> 01:4:21,119 01:4:18,559 --> 01:4:23,480 writer I can't write and I'm like 01:4:21,109 --> 01:4:23,480 01:4:21,119 --> 01:4:26,279 explain to me why you can't write and 01:4:23,470 --> 01:4:26,279 01:4:23,480 --> 01:4:28,520 they'll mention a or B I'm like look 01:4:26,269 --> 01:4:28,520 01:4:26,279 --> 01:4:29,880 I've heard that a hundred times and so 01:4:28,510 --> 01:4:29,880 01:4:28,520 --> 01:4:32,000 not just giving them answers but then 01:4:29,870 --> 01:4:32,000 01:4:29,880 --> 01:4:34,119 trying to give them a proper tactical 01:4:31,990 --> 01:4:34,119 01:4:32,000 --> 01:4:36,119 solution because writing is the scary 01:4:34,109 --> 01:4:36,119 01:4:34,119 --> 01:4:37,880 thing I think it begins when we're in 01:4:36,109 --> 01:4:37,880 01:4:36,119 --> 01:4:40,720 elementary school it extends in middle 01:4:37,870 --> 01:4:40,720 01:4:37,880 --> 01:4:43,720 school it's the scary thing people are 01:4:40,710 --> 01:4:43,720 01:4:40,720 --> 01:4:46,880 afraid to look bad in public and I think 01:4:43,710 --> 01:4:46,880 01:4:43,720 --> 01:4:48,839 that that's why we have this this 01:4:46,870 --> 01:4:48,839 01:4:46,880 --> 01:4:51,520 inefficiency in the world right now it's 01:4:48,829 --> 01:4:51,520 01:4:48,839 --> 01:4:54,160 hard to just I think you know I mean it 01:4:51,510 --> 01:4:54,160 01:4:51,520 --> 01:4:56,440 takes a lot of time it's the folks 01:4:54,150 --> 01:4:56,440 01:4:54,160 --> 01:4:58,599 you're discussing or busy people with 01:4:56,430 --> 01:4:58,599 01:4:56,440 --> 01:5:0,599 families and careers and like to sit 01:4:58,589 --> 01:5:0,599 01:4:58,599 --> 01:5:1,880 down and structure your day around it 01:5:0,589 --> 01:5:1,880 01:5:0,599 --> 01:5:4,119 right I mean it really acquires new 01:5:1,870 --> 01:5:4,119 01:5:1,880 --> 01:5:5,440 habits in many ways I had to kind of 01:5:4,109 --> 01:5:5,440 01:5:4,119 --> 01:5:8,400 change to write the book I had to change 01:5:5,430 --> 01:5:8,400 01:5:5,440 --> 01:5:10,119 a lot of my lifestyle yeah your wife at 01:5:8,390 --> 01:5:10,119 01:5:8,400 --> 01:5:12,079 the end and you say thank you yeah my 01:5:10,109 --> 01:5:12,079 01:5:10,119 --> 01:5:16,039 wife did a lot you know just um 01:5:12,069 -->

true fans and the 01:6:41,269 --> 01:6:42,799 01:6:41,279 --> 01:6:44,520 idea was this is still in the kind of 01:6:42,789 --> 01:6:44,520 01:6:42,799 --> 01:6:46,520 optimistic year I he wrote in the early 01:6:44,510 --> 01:6:46,520 01:6:44,520 --> 01:6:48,119 2000s but it was before the kind of what 01:6:46,510 --> 01:6:48,119 01:6:46,520 --> 01:6:49,400 I think of as the reversal where the 01:6:48,109 --> 01:6:49,400 01:6:48,119 --> 01:6:50,720 internet got taken over by these 01:6:49,390 --> 01:6:50,720 01:6:49,400 --> 01:6:54,039 companies and it was still kind of this 01:6:50,710 --> 01:6:54,039 01:6:50,720 --> 01:6:56,880 open internet utopian dream and the idea 01:6:54,029 --> 01:6:56,880 01:6:54,039 --> 01:6:59,279 was the internet would change um how 01:6:56,870 --> 01:6:59,279 01:6:56,880 --> 01:7:1,000 creators can make a living and 01:6:59,269 --> 01:7:1,000 01:6:59,279 --> 01:7:2,880 specifically that instead of needing 01:7:0,990 --> 01:7:2,880 01:7:1,000 --> 01:7:5,400 kind of mass Market distribution so you 01:7:2,870 --> 01:7:5,400 01:7:2,880 --> 01:7:7,000 think about pre- internet music you had 01:7:5,390 --> 01:7:7,000 01:7:5,400 --> 01:7:9,680 to get you know you either got a record 01:7:6,990 --> 01:7:9,680 01:7:7,000 --> 01:7:11,839 deal and on the radio and you were sort 01:7:9,670 --> 01:7:11,839 01:7:9,680 --> 01:7:13,319 of a pop star or you were broke right or 01:7:11,829 --> 01:7:13,319 01:7:11,839 --> 01:7:14,640 something I mean sort of Maybe not maybe 01:7:13,309 --> 01:7:14,640 01:7:13,319 --> 01:7:16,039 there some was in the middle but for the 01:7:14,630 --> 01:7:16,039 01:7:14,640 --> 01:7:18,200 most part that was kind of the game 01:7:16,029 --> 01:7:18,200 01:7:16,039 --> 01:7:19,559 right you had to get this Mass audience 01:7:18,190 --> 01:7:19,559 01:7:18,200 --> 01:7:21,119 and so a lot of the early promise of the 01:7:19,549 --> 01:7:21,119 01:7:19,559 --> 01:7:22,920 internet was that you this would change 01:7:21,109 --> 01:7:22,920 01:7:21,119 --> 01:7:25,160 it and you could have all of these sort 01:7:22,910 --> 01:7:25,160 01:7:22,920 --> 01:7:27,480 of millions and millions of niches the 01:7:25,150 --> 01:7:27,480 01:7:25,160 --> 01:7:28,920 key idea is when you remove all of these 01:7:27,470 --> 01:7:28,920 01:7:27,480 --> 01:7:30,960 layers of 01:7:28,910 --> 01:7:30,960 01:7:28,920 --> 01:7:33,240 intermediaries you just dramatically 01:7:30,950 --> 01:7:33,240 01:7:30,960 --> 01:7:34,880 change the economics of creators like I 01:7:33,230 --> 01:7:34,880 01:7:33,240 --> 01:7:37,559 think I get I'm actually putting all the 01:7:34,870 --> 01:7:37,559 01:7:34,880 --> 01:7:40,599 money from the book back into the book 01:7:37,549 --> 01:7:40,599 01:7:37,559 --> 01:7:41,960 um marketing but I believe I get 15% I 01:7:40,589 --> 01:7:41,960 01:7:40,599 --> 01:7:43,520 think that's what book authors get I'm 01:7:41,950 --> 01:7:43,520 01:7:41,960 --> 01:7:45,400 pretty sure it's 15% I mean that's I 01:7:43,510 --> 01:7:45,400 01:7:43,520 --> 01:7:46,520 mean look it's nice but 85% goes 01:7:45,390 --> 01:7:46,520 01:7:45,400 --> 01:7:47,599 somewhere else like right I mean like 01:7:46,510 --> 01:7:47,599 01:7:46,520 --> 01:7:49,079 there's a lot of intermed there I mean 01:7:47,589 --> 01:7:49,079 01:7:47,599 --> 01:7:50,640 look and I'm not begrudging that like 01:7:49,069 --> 01:7:50,640 01:7:49,079 --> 01:7:52,359 the retailer should get paid and the 01:7:50,630 --> 01:7:52,359 01:7:50,640 --> 01:7:54,960 publisher should get paid but like 01:7:52,349 --> 01:7:54,960 01:7:52,359 --> 01:7:58,960 that's the way that most um creative 01:7:54,950 --> 01:7:58,960 01:7:54,960 --> 01:8:0,760 Economics work um and so that was the 01:7:58,950 --> 01:8:0,760 01:7:58,960 --> 01:8:2,640 promise that was the sort of original 01:8:0,750 --> 01:8:2,640 01:8:0,760 --> 01:8:4,000 promise of the internet um was that you 01:8:2,630 --> 01:8:4,000 01:8:2,640 --> 01:8:5,720 could go direct and then that would just 01:8:3,990 --> 01:8:5,720 01:8:4,000 --> 01:8:7,240 dramatically transform the economics and 01:8:5,710 --> 01:8:7,240 01:8:5,720 --> 01:8:9,000 you wouldn't need to go Mass market and 01:8:7,230 --> 01:8:9,000 01:8:7,240 --> 01:8:10,720 what that meant and that that so I think 01:8:8,990 --> 01:8:10,720 01:8:9,000 --> 01:8:11,880 that is very important not just because 01:8:10,710 --> 01:8:11,880 01:8:10,720 --> 01:8:14,200 creators should make money and that 01:8:11,870 --> 01:8:14,200 01:8:11,880 --> 01:8:15,480 would let them make money right but also 01:8:14,190 --> 01:8:15,480 01:8:14,200 --> 01:8:17,839 that means you could get kind of the 01:8:15,470 --> 01:8:17,839 01:8:15,480 --> 01:8:19,560 world you're describing right like 01:8:17,829 --> 01:8:19,560 01:8:17,839 --> 01:8:21,600 here's my argument to you is is a world 01:8:19,550 --> 01:8:21,600 01:8:19,560 --> 01:8:23,880 you're describing where you know I'm an 01:8:21,590 --> 01:8:23,880 01:8:21,600 --> 01:8:25,279 expert on air airplane propellers like 01:8:23,870 --> 01:8:25,279 01:8:23,880 --> 01:8:27,600 why isn't that person sharing the 01:8:25,269 --> 01:8:27,600 01:8:25,279 --> 01:8:30,759 information um part of it is this m the 01:8:27,590 --> 01:8:30,759 01:8:27,600 --> 01:8:32,159 logic of mass of of of mass audiences 01:8:30,749 --> 01:8:32,159 01:8:30,759 --> 01:8:33,359 right like today because like how many 01:8:32,149 --> 01:8:33,359 01:8:32,159 --> 01:8:35,799 people are actually interested in this 01:8:33,349 --> 01:8:35,799 01:8:33,359 --> 01:8:38,040 you know whatever you know pick your 01:8:35,789 --> 01:8:38,040 01:8:35,799 --> 01:8:39,759 Niche you know how many people and and 01:8:38,030 --> 01:8:39,759 01:8:38,040 --> 01:8:42,719 the answer is often not that many people 01:8:39,749 --> 01:8:42,719 01:8:39,759 --> 01:8:45,159 maybe it is only thousands right um and 01:8:42,709 --> 01:8:45,159 01:8:42,719 --> 01:8:46,359 so you know a lot of this comes down to 01:8:45,149 --> 01:8:46,359 01:8:45,159 --> 01:8:48,600 the internet structure like what if we 01:8:46,349 --> 01:8:48,600 01:8:46,359 --> 01:8:50,640 had an internet where in we didn't have 01:8:48,590 --> 01:8:50,640 01:8:48,600 --> 01:8:52,080 these intermediary so I mean so to Kevin 01:8:50,630 --> 01:8:52,080 01:8:50,640 --> 01:8:53,799 Kell going back Kevin Kelly wrote this 01:8:52,070 --> 01:8:53,799 01:8:52,080 --> 01:8:54,920 post this is where people like me and 01:8:53,789 --> 01:8:54,920 01:8:53,799 --> 01:8:56,600 everyone thought this was headed we're 01:8:54,910 --> 01:8:56,600 01:8:54,920 --> 01:8:58,000 going to have this internet without 01:8:56,590 --> 01:8:58,000 01:8:56,600 --> 01:8:59,120 intermediaries everyone's going to have 01:8:57,990 --> 01:8:59,120 01:8:58,000 --> 01:9:1,159 a direct relationship with their 01:8:59,110 --> 01:9:1,159 01:8:59,120 --> 01:9:3,520 audience and that will in turn have the 01:9:1,149 --> 01:9:3,520 01:9:1,159 --> 01:9:5,400 secondary benefit of everyone if you can 01:9:3,510 --> 01:9:5,400 01:9:3,520 --> 01:9:7,400 have this millions of niches and people 01:9:5,390 --> 01:9:7,400 01:9:5,400 --> 01:9:9,480 can make a living serving a niche 01:9:7,390 --> 01:9:9,480 01:9:7,400 --> 01:9:10,920 instead of serving a mass audience right 01:9:9,470 --> 01:9:10,920 01:9:9,480 --> 01:9:13,279 and that would have this additional kind 01:9:10,910 --> 01:9:13,279 01:9:10,920 --> 01:9:15,319 of nice human flourishing aspect that 01:9:13,269 --> 01:9:15,319 01:9:13,279 --> 01:9:17,560 everyone could just do you know you if 01:9:15,309 --> 01:9:17,560 01:9:15,319 --> 01:9:19,359 you if you're interest in some weird 01:9:17,550 --> 01:9:19,359 01:9:17,560 --> 01:9:23,120 Niche you can just go do it and you 01:9:19,349 --> 01:9:23,120 01:9:19,359 --> 01:9:25,679 don't have to sacrifice your creative 01:9:23,110 --> 01:9:25,679 01:9:23,120 --> 01:9:27,799 ideals to sort of sell out right you 01:9:25,669 --> 01:9:27,799 01:9:25,679 --> 01:9:29,640 don't have to you can stay in Indie band 01:9:27,789 --> 01:9:29,640 01:9:27,799 --> 01:9:31,480 you don't have to go try to be a you 01:9:29,630 --> 01:9:31,480 01:9:29,640 --> 01:9:32,960 know you can stay the cool Indie band in 01:9:31,470 --> 01:9:32,960 01:9:31,480 --> 01:9:34,359 Brooklyn and you don't have to go try to 01:9:32,950 --> 01:9:34,359 01:9:32,960 --> 01:9:36,120 be you know playing stadiums in 01:9:34,349 --> 01:9:36,120 01:9:34,359 --> 01:9:37,640 Milwaukee right like and that just 01:9:36,110 --> 01:9:37,640 01:9:36,120 --> 01:9:40,000 seemed not only like a better economic 01:9:37,630 --> 01:9:40,000 01:9:37,640 --> 01:9:41,440 future but a better cultural future and 01:9:39,990 --> 01:9:41,440 01:9:40,000 --> 01:9:43,600 that was what was so exciting about that 01:9:41,430 --> 01:9:43,600 01:9:41,440 --> 01:9:45,120 idea and I think that idea Got Hijacked 01:9:43,590 --> 01:9:45,120 01:9:43,600 --> 01:9:47,159 by these big tech companies who 01:9:45,110 --> 01:9:47,159 01:9:45,120 --> 01:9:49,239 basically the Facebooks and the twitters 01:9:47,149 --> 01:9:49,239 01:9:47,159 --> 01:9:50,600 reinserted themselves as intermediaries 01:9:49,229 --> 01:9:50,600 01:9:49,239 --> 01:9:51,920 we actually have now a situation that I 01:9:50,590 --> 01:9:51,920 01:9:50,600 --> 01:9:54,840 would argue is even worse than the pre- 01:9:51,910 --> 01:9:54,840 01:9:51,920 --> 01:9:56,800 internet era because in the pre era like 01:9:54,830 --> 01:9:56,800 01:9:54,840 --> 01:9:59,000 I just soed the book I get 15% on 01:9:56,790 --> 01:9:59,000 01:9:56,800 --> 01:10:1,719 Facebook you get 0% right they they make 01:9:58,990 --> 01:10:1,719 01:9:59,000 --> 01:10:3,679 $150 billion a year running ads and they share none of that with the creators like it's really almost unprecedented in business history that you have intermediaries that don't share any of the revenue some it varies like YouTube shares 45% um you know Spotify takes 30% the labels take another huge chunk you know so like each one varies but like the main social networks take 100% I go this is all you know I walk through this all in detail in the book but um so you know that that I think as a result has created a whole bunch of negative effects one is economic but they're also kind of cultural ones what is it now now what do you try to do on these networks well you try to go get a mass audience you try to appeal to lowest common denominator you talk I've heard you talk about recency bias the algorithms favor freshness and newness and liveness and sensationalism so angry and that's the thing out of all the things in the world that is the thing I'm the most Ang so the algorithms are just like whatever the algorithm favors and by the way these algorithms are opaque they don't disclose what they do who knows what they do they you do Al like they also look they do I I know that for example for a fact that what Tik Tok is doing right now what Tik Tok is doing right now is so they so Tik Tok grew with a few major kind of creators who you know got Mill hundreds of millions of followers and Tik Tok doesn't like that they don't want to be dependent on a few big creators because then those creators can switch and so what they do is they then turn the dial to like support some new creators and downturn so there's always these sort of odds behind the curtain turning the dials on these social networks deciding kind of who wins and who loses who gets reach you know what and and and all these kind of manipulation goes on um and so anyway so I just think that we've really gotten off path from where the internet could be um and where kind of Kevin Kelly envisioned it and you talk about the death of the middle so if I'm thinking about I I mean literally I am a Creator and I want to make good money as a Creator I don't want to sacrifice Income At least I mean I don't I don't need to be a billionaire but I don't want to sacrifice income meaningfully I don't want to you know pick table scraps you know in my wooden Shack or something how should I be thinking about my career as a Creator in terms of where the internet is evolving yeah there's a lot of that's a multi-layer question so first let me talk about death of the middle death of the middle is a is a common pattern in technology I give you an example retail okay so uh with the rise of the internet so before the internet you had these department stores like JC Penny and Sears and you also had you know of course like more like uh you know high-end Boutique out outlets and things like this and Walmart um and what the internet did is it sort of killed the middle death of the middle and so what that means is JC Penney and Sears and all the kind of Kmarts if they didn't go bankrupt they're soon to go bankrupt and what it rewarded was the two edges the people call also barbell hyperscale Amazon and Walmart why they succeed in that world right because they are just the most cost effective they can invest in robotic factories and all these other kinds of things they do and on the other end of the spectrum like the ultra like high touch boutiques like Gucci lbmh and by the way not a coincidence that I think the two richest people in the world are or two of the top five Jeff basos on the one hand and Pier no on the other who's lvmh which is a roll up of it's a private Equity style roll up of those high-end boutiques right and so so those two ends of the of the of the spectrum worked well like by the way I think this happened in media with the book industry has done like I asked my friends in the book industry when I wrote this book and like how's the book industry doing like it's pretty good it's actually stayed pretty much fine throughout the internet like the internet it changes you know there's book talk and how people find books but it hasn't dramat I think the revenues of the book industry have grown a little bit or flat like it hasn't disrupted the book industry right um whereas you know and and then so what's succeeded in the internet era it's on the one hand long for very long form books on the other hand very the opposite in the Spectrum like 20 Tik toks and 140 or now I guess you know 400 character tweets or whatever right like the two ends of the spectrum what has died we were talking about earlier unfortunately is sort of in the middle like right it's blogging it's certainly magazines that Sports Illustrated just announced they shutting down like yeah yeah so like where they laid everybody up yeah no I mean so like that industry outside of maybe the high photo quality ones like Vogue is basically decimated like a lot of the in media so that's the middle like middle length middle quality middle investment like you can Define there's nuances to how you define it and so by the way I think a simple model I'm not saying this right but it's a first good first guess is like what will AI do to writing like chat gbt probably death of the middle right which means if you're super highend if you're you know a great author or you know a great publication or some one other kind of thing you're probably okay I mean I don't think people buy you know like you know high-end fiction for they buy it for the writing but they also it's important to them it's written by a person and there's a human connection there's a status thing too hey because when you the party you can't go to an upper east side party there's a community thing and like look people talk about this too like with ch an interesting case study right chess I think computers got better than machine sorry computers got better than humans in chess what like 20 years ago or something chess is more popular than ever on the Internet by by a significant margin and people like watching other people play chess and they don't watch computers play chess right so they're not watching for the pure quality of the game because if you did you just watch AI fight each other play each other um they're watching for it's the whole thing humans like humans right and I think that will remain the case with art I I think that it will mean that it becomes more important that you lean into the community the status the humanity of it right like that you really like that you're reading this person writing about it like that matters I'll tell you sort of when at a smart entrepreneur asked me the other day he said hey AI could really hurt your business and I've been working on this piece with you we're working on one together and he said how should I be thinking about this piece differently in terms of the ai's round and I said here's what it is you got to focus on two things first you need a great insight and one way to define a great Insight is that AI disagrees with you that AI as a sort of consensus calibration mechanism because you think of AI as the average of the internet in a way AI thinks wrong so we'll use that as a starting point so we can use AI for a definition there so you need a great insight and then like your book it needs to be supported by firsthand knowledge deep firsthand knowledge where you can write about that knowledge and it comes through that you've really been there through the depth of your observations the clarity of your thinking and then what I would say that you have to do I love what you just said humans like humans what then you got to do is layer on a personal component I don't just want to hear your data your Insight sites your all that stuff I want to hear a personal story when you were in The Boardroom when you were founding your company when you went you sold your product to Whole Foods For the First Time what was that like how did that feel and if you can think through that deep Insight that AI disagrees with you on simple idea your core idea one line and you can layer personal stories with that that human- to human connection I think you're good to go I think that's also closely con I agree with you and I think it's also closely connected to what I was calling earlier authenticity yeah because I think authenticity too like your Humanity shows through and people are very I think especially modern people who are just consuming information all day I think they're very good at detecting inauthentic things I I don't know I just I maybe I'm overestimating I think people can just immediately tell is that authentic or is that like I'm being sold something yep and so I think that's part of it too is that that like part of the showing your humanity is being authentic and vulnerable and complex and nuanced and multifaceted and all the other kinds of things right and personal and telling stories and so so I think so I think in a so I think just the first pass not not having you know it's a crystal ball is that things like AI like AI is going to be important it's going to grow it's a big deal um it's the you know we are probably at a um kind of in a year ago was an inflection point like the thing about it is like we already know these models are good but we also know that when you just basically throw more data and compute at these models which is happening um get better and so there's sort of a there's what they call the scaling laws which is that they you know that the that the sort of the IQ of the system goes up with more gpus and data and there and at some point that will everything asmp tootes everything in the world basically at some point has some point at which there's diminishing returns um but we're not at that point yet and so that will get better that will change writing I think I think there's some really interesting stuff um like there's work being done where sort of co-pilot uh work meaning and I think this might be very likely in the future where you can um have a very smart kind of assist AI assistant writing that will help people um and uh you know it will recall notes recall things you read suggest relevant things recall State we're talking about State how great would it be if as you're doing your rewrite the AI can track the state of what the read yes this this concept has already been explained that would have been so useful for that would been incredibly useful um I like I would have just liked something that's like a more advanced like hey you're using some passive voice like just reminders of writing hey maybe this Clause should go over here you know just like a smart editor like I would think that would be really useful I actually found I tried a little bit of chat gbt on the book it's funny my friend of mine S A friend of mine he's like I had never thought to do this he said I I ran it what's it called zero GPT I ran your thing through a GPT Checker and you scored one 0% or one like meaning un plagiarism it was yes well it wasn't plagiar it wasn't written by a machine I was it was clear to my nerd friend that it was not written by machine which I that's good because it wasn't but I did I did of play around with chat GPT during it um and didn't and I found it like it's amazing technolog is very good but it was not my voice and it was not of the quality I want to write but but it will get much better but I think this co-pilot kind of use case is really exciting and I think to your vision of getting more people to write I think that could be a very powerful um way to do that I think the you know I would much rather see the co-pilot Vision because I feel like if it's just written by chat GPT and it's more like people like you're just GNA it's going to get really not it's not going to be good like I don't think I I think you need to keep like we need to find the right balance between the things machines are good at which is like you said like recalling did you already say this helping you with tactical rewrites but I think if you have the machine do all of it you're going to at least for the near term maybe the machines will get so magical at some point but at least in the near term you're going to lose the voice and the human Humanity of it well the other thing that I would love to think through with you and we can probably end the podcast here is the thing that I would like to see changed about the internet is no more recency bias in the way that we have it now we have the dial up really high and I would like to see places on the internet where we don't for example I would love to see a Twitter feed that shows me basically all the tweets that I've liked and bookmarked and they just repopulate repopulate space repetition why am I not seeing a great tweet from you from 2013 somebody else from 2016 I mean I guess the question is like the push back to that argument would like is it the systems or is it the people like in other words like I'm just giving you the steel Manning the counterargument which is that that maybe you know look we tried that maybe Facebook would say and it just turns out people want the new stuff you know and and and what I would say back is that the architecture it might be true that it is what people want but to me it's what people want in the same way way that people want sugar and process foods and yes this to me is a big problem with markets that what people want in the now is not the same as what people want over the longtime Horizon of their life which is not the same as what's good for society and I agree it is what gets engagement there's no doubt about it but to the reason why this is so important is if we can create a place where people can consistently find great works then people can benefit from a really well-written piece over a much longer time Horizon so if someone writes a great Twitter thread at this point it's only going to be shown in the feed for 48 hours what does it look like to have something shown in the feed for the next 10 years because it's worthy of that it's worthy of being shared and being read repeatedly I mean like I would argue part of this is the is is sort of the topic of my book which is so the you know part of my theme is that that the that the other network design so if you look at the web the web is a protocol Network like the web doesn't have the same recency bias um that there you know that if you go look at the usage of websites it's much more uniformly distributed across the age of the website um than the people reading on Twitter or something so a lot of this is that you have these companies controlling these networks and they are optimizing for things that aren't just you know that are that are basically they're optimizing for profit motives um and so they're optimizing for quick engagement and kind of sugar highs if as you will um so I do think that is part of the problem I don't think I think it's complex though because I think it's also like look I think part of the problem is like look if you look at people's diets like when they first introduced sugary cereal I know I grew up like just everyone ate sugary cereal like and then over time people realized there were trade-offs and I do think we're in this period where like social media just kind of H I mean it's been around for 15 years but really only has a mass medium for less than a decade really that the mass has got on and so everyone rushes in and grabs the sugar cereal and then I think over time I what I hope is that as a society we kind of come back and find a balance right um and sort of say okay like in the same way you know now there's this sort of big at least in the tech world I'm in there's the whole kind of Andrew huberman like optimization yeah optimization like eat certain diets like I'm like this I'm kind of like high protein and don't drink and all these other things and like I of my friends are like that and so you know it's not like always fun like you you know to to do that but you over time you realize wait a second this is not sustainable way to live and I think that people might get to that point too with social media and things I do like like I have a rule for myself that I have to read 50 pages of a book every day um and that and this part of this is to not use social media um and to get off the computer and you know just always spend time on sort of I think a books is kind of the protein of um of the Mind and social media in many cases the sugar and if I don't go and sort of have rules around that and and I often find like the first five minutes sometimes I'm distracted and everything else but then I get in the flow and actually the reason I have the 50 page rule is that um often after reading 50 pages I want to read another 50 pages so it's like it's enough time to force me to kind of get off the sugar um I love that yeah and so I think people will gra My Hope Is that that people will grapple with these things over time and find the better balance we're we're out of whack right now I think well I think we can close here cuz I thought this was a hilarious anecdote and this is a benefit of printed books is I remembered where on the page I read it so I could look at my little stickies and it basically could narrow down but I thought this was really interesting that discovering the real power the real powers of a new medium takes time when Johannes Gutenberg inventor of the movable type printing press published his namesake Bible in the 15 Century he made it look like a handmade manuscript copy who could imagine anything else and it was only about 150 years later that we ended up thinking of that we ended up realizing that the printing press would lead to science and um scientific and political revolution and that that's a that's a that's part of a passage talking about generally with whenever there's New Media there's a transition period And I call it sort of the distinction I use comes from Steve Jobs is skoric versus native Technologies um and so you know like the early plays sorry early films around 1905 or something the play they they took plays and they filmed them and then they you know and then the um you know the the like I mean a whole bunch of Technology sort of devel the early internet was like uh you know if you look at the 90s internet it was like magazine brochures and cataloges and it was all sort of taking these ideas from from the offline world because you didn't people hadn't fully figured it out yet and books were like that too so yeah the original books looked like monks scribes and and and the use case was what else would you do with it but but the Bible and of course later on you have you know fast forward you know you have all these guys writing you know Anonymous letters during the American Revolution and all the other kinds of you know things that happened um you know dramatic things that happened through the written word in the next couple hundred years so and books like this hey Chris congratulations read WR own I really enjoyed this book and I agree with you strongly that there's a few things that are deeply off about the modern technological sphere and it's time to change those things so thanks for writing this thank you David appreciate it
