hey guys come on back should we offer you some water oh yeah we're cool [Music] with me mark hi we took a look at everything and congratulations we're going to start you off with a 500 000 investment in august 2004 teal gave zuckerberg 500 and in return he joined facebook's board and received a 10.2 stake in the company when i first got to know my guest peter thiel he was a struggling student at stanford law school since then he has co-founded paypal become one of the principal investors in facebook and turned his present company clarium capital into the one one of the leading hedge funds in the nation and this was the first outside investment in facebook and at the time it valued the company at 4.9 million dollars in 2012 teal would make over a 2000 x return on his initial check which earned him more than a billion dollars so this begs the question was this just luck well partially of course but when you look at teal's track record of successful investments it's clear that he's got a secret worth studying and to uncover that secret it helps to contrast peter teal with his younger self as an undergraduate at stanford he studied philosophy before enrolling in stanford law school it was during his philosophical pursuits that teal started studying the work of rene gerard who was a professor at stanford at the time teel was both curious and ambitious but he was a lost young man and he says looking back on that time that when young people don't know what they're going to do with their lives they look at what everybody else is doing and they copy them and so what teal did was after he graduated as an undergrad from stanford he followed the path of prestige and pursued a law degree but thiel says that if he could do it again he would have spent more time thinking about his future partially because of the steep prices of university degrees i went to stanford undergrad stanford law school throughout the 90s i had a belief that education was absolutely paramount we should only hire people who went to the best schools and and we discriminated on this basis very aggressively in hiring at paypal and i use this i used to and i i thought this was the the most important thing um in our society and over the last four or five years i've gradually come to shift my views on it after graduating from stanford law school he clerked for a little while before eventually becoming a securities lawyer at a prestigious law firm called sullivan and cromwell in new york city and during his time there thiel noticed that basically every lawyer competed for the exact same prize at the end of the path and it was to rise the ranks to become a supreme court clerk and it was the same kind of competitive and cutthroat environment that thiel's mentor renee gerard had warned him about when he was talking about his work on memetic theory when they were sitting in those classrooms at stanford thinking about how disturbingly herd-like people become in so many different contexts is something that memetic theory forces you it forces you to think about that which is a sort of knowledge that's generally um suppressed and hidden and and so uh you will be um as an investor entrepreneur i've always tried to be contrarian to go against the crowd to identify opportunities that in places where people were not looking gerard wrote we desire what others desire because we imitate their desires teal left that law firm less than a year after working there and when he did he cited a lack of what he called transcendental value in his work and that decision was guided by his study of philosophy because had it not been for gerard and his ideas perhaps teal would have stayed in the hyper-competitive environment at sullivan and cromwell and continue to climb this mimetic ladder of more status and more prestige so what we talked about just now those ideas those are gerard's ideas and now as an investor this is where teo comes in he says that the next step is to start looking for secrets and by that he means important truths about the world that other people don't realize i think there is always a secret at the core of every great business there's some um some sort of research program that uh or some some area that people are really really focused on they think about really hard and it sort of advances they're thinking to the point where they get an understanding about something that other people do not yet have you see everybody's map of the world is incomplete yours is mine is the next person you see all of us either because we lack information or we're blinded by dogma and on top of that the world is always changing faster than our ability to map its developments so you if you can find secrets it's like you've tapped into the future and you're a step ahead of everybody else remember those early social networks friendster and myspace why did they go out of business well they weren't bad companies but some would say they were too early to reach critical mass and others would say they were too slow to innovate friendster and then the one i used to use myspace these were dominant social networks i still remember using my myspace thinking it was the next big thing and that's when whoop facebook came along when facebook launched smartphones they were right around the corner and broadband internet access was just starting to gain traction and this was crucial at the time because photo uploading and later profile stocking would become a core function of facebook and in order to do those things people needed faster uploading and downloading space within six weeks eighty percent of the students were essentially using the service and by using the service i mean they checked it more than four times a day that was reid hoffman a partner at great lock one of silicon valley's top venture capital firms and hoffman was the guy who offered peter thiel the opportunity to invest in facebook because hoffman was a co-founder in linkedin he thought that it would be a conflict of interest to invest in the company himself and now you may think that getting an offer like that to invest in facebook is the easiest billion dollars you'd ever make but you know what a lot of respected investors passed up on that opportunity the history books cite people like michael greeley and scott tobin who thought that the company was just too risky to invest in and who could blame them mark zuckerberg was just 19 years old at the time even if he was a student at harvard but teal teal saw past that and because he did he made one of the most famous angel investments in silicon valley history unsurprisingly with paypal and facebook two of teal's most successful companies he had a specific secret and in his essay the education of a libertarian he wrote i no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible because there are no truly free places left in our world i suspect that the mode for escape must involve some sort of new and hitherto untried process that leads us to some undiscovered country and for this reason i have focused my efforts on new technologies that may create a new space for freedom it is clear then why teal invested in companies like facebook and paypal which we just talked about while paypal centered on the creation of a new world currency and ending monetary sovereignty it was facebook that created this space for new modes of descent and new ways to form communities which weren't bounded by historical nation-states and though both of those ideas never quite came to fruition both of those companies they did promise the ability to change the existing social and political order while elevating authentic human freedom which teo believes to be the precondition for the highest good and if you want a practical guide on how to find secrets like these make sure to watch this video about peter thiel
