welcome everybody so the first thing I'm David and I'm with Sahil and we are going to be talking about business writing today so the first thing that I'd love to just know from all of you is if you could just throw in the chat not the QA where you're from it's always really fun to see people from all around the world I'm almost certain we have someone here from from Europe and Asia and South America this always really hits me unbelievable India Toronto Alaska Bay Area New Delhi China India 4 a.m. Guatemala London on our panelists from Panama Sheila for all of you who have stayed up late Pakistan for all of Nova Scotia for all of you who have stayed up late and woken up early thank you for being here yes Samuel is amazing that's exactly why I invited him and say oh you want to introduce yourself before we begin yeah so my name is Sahil I run a company called Gumroad that I started in 2011 a long time ago to help creators sell digital content including myself and I've been running that since been through some ups and downs raise a bunch of venture capital bought back most of the investors now I run it as sort of a profitable growing software business we've sent around 280 million dollars to creators and so yeah that's kind of that's that's what I do and then I write some stuff I paint do us do some other random stuff a quick question so what when you said that you started it for yourself I'm actually not familiar with this so were you or on your own or what was the story behind that yeah it actually fits great into this the context of this thing because it was a pencil icon that I designed for a Mac and I was just home one Friday night learning photorealistic icon design and at the end of it I had this icon that I wanted to sell to my Twitter audience you know I thought maybe at four hours I could have done in an hour too if I had the source file or something like that and so I tried doing it and realize it was really hard back in 2011 you know this is before stripe and a lot of the services that exist today and so that weekend I built Gumroad just Saturday some day stay at home built Gumroad launched it Monday morning so it was it was a productive weekend for sure definitely a productive weekend so before I introduce myself here's the plan everybody so we're gonna do these brief introductions and then Sahil is going to present he will present for 20-25 minutes I will inevitably interrupt and then I will present and he will inevitably interrupt and comment as needed but before we get into those presentations I want to introduce our three panelists so first I'd like to introduce Becca she is my assistant and she will be moderate monitoring monitoring the chat today Becca hi I'm Becca I live in California my my background is that I'm kind of a French horn player and an artist myself so I'm really curious to hear more about kind of how writing works in terms of creating a business and you know keeping it having writing serve your business I'll be mostly taking notes so I might not be in the chat too much but I'm excited to talk with everybody great so what Becca will take notes and then we will email you all of those notes so you can take notes on your own but Becca is gonna write you a mini book about today's session so that is what she's up to and then we'll he is in charge of monitoring the chat he is the student director for rite-of-passage the course that I run will why don't you introduce yourself thanks David hey guys I'm will I'm course manager for rite-of-passage building a second brain and yeah I'm just excited to be here curious to hear what these guys have to say and I'll keep an eye on the chat and I'm coming to you from Los Angeles and then Anna is my business partner we run a creativity focused summer camp called rite-of-passage summer camp we do it for nine to eleven year olds so if you have any kids and you want your kids to just make make make make make onna is the best teacher in the world and she's gonna introduce herself oh that's nice of you David hi I'm Donna from Panama like David said we are both created this course called rite-of-passage summer camp I'm a rite of passage alum that's how I met David and we quickly realized that we see learning through a different lens especially for kids as a more playful and self-motivated experience that we've created this online space for kids from all over the world to join and have a chance to explore their passions find a problem that they really care about and then together ID eight solutions to this problem and they built a prototype in a week and they present by Friday we just did the pilot last week there for the first time and it was wonderful and we're gonna be doing another pilot in two weeks May 18 we're gonna be announcing it on Monday and we would love to have kids from different places again and and for them to experience this energy of live online learning and what it is to learn in a fun and collaborative way with other kids so that'll give you a little overview of what's happening behind the scenes of Team David for all the rite-of-passage alums who are here I see quite a few but why don't you introduce yourselves in the chat and just say hello I'd love to see who's here I'm David prale as I mentioned I run rite of passage so we have a five-week course for adults who want to build their audience learn how to ride online learn how to do a lot of the things that we're gonna talk about in the next hour and a half I mean this is really what we do we have conversations like this and I teach in the way that I'm gonna teach today for five weeks but then we have just an amazing community that you could think of as CrossFit for writing that people come together they they learn how to do a similar set of workout so to speak and then everybody helps each other but then we actually build audiences and become experts and authority figures in our niches and then I also run a summer camp with onna for nine to eleven year olds so without further ado what I want to do is I want to let Sahil share he presented a he has a series of slides for you and he's gonna share Sahil I'll barge in at a certain point you should have screen sharing privileges and if you don't I can share my screen for you but that'll be slightly more difficult it says host disabled attendee screen share okay well let me change that right you should be able to make him co-host yeah you should be good now awesome great sweet let me minimize this very annoying new zoom bar that always happens cool so can everyone see yep awesome cool so I already already talked about this but basically gummer it helps creators we help musician designers writers filmmakers anyone that makes digital content we help them sell it directly to their audience take you know the vast majority the revenue you know from films courses music books stand-up comedy all sorts of stuff and I'm super excited about this because I think the fundamental thing that all of those people have in common what I have in common what everyone sort of listening and watching has in common is that we all right we're all writers it's very difficult you know you can do stand-up comedy you can do filmmaking you can do all these other things and you know and that's what you do but the sort of I think the base commonality that I think everybody has is writing you know sort of a form the form of communication is something that every single person needs to develop in my opinion the way I talk about it is like you're going to write just like you're gonna eat you might have you might as well write well just like you might as well eat well because you can't really avoid avoidant you know you're gonna spend a lot of time doing this everyone puts 10 down 10,000 hours towards the skill so as long as you do it intently get feedback all these sorts of things I think I think really everyone can be an amazing writer and selfishly I think like a world full of better writers is better for me I haven't I have a tweet about this I have a lot of tweets you can go check out my account they're a little bit more pithy than then probably what I actually believe but sort of the I think that the sort of emotional resonance is the same which is basically everybody everybody writes it's a sort of a fundamental thing if you're a designer right or founder engineered lawyer etc specific to Gumroad in the way that i think about about running the business i think writing is it's probably even more fundamental you can read about you know like the amazon memos and you know writing is a large part of the culture at amazon and that's all awesome but I think we've sort of almost we just try to take it kind of on purpose to an extreme like how much how much can we rely on on the skill of writing and when we when we when we recruit people like right like their ability to write their ability to communicate in this in this in this manner is sort of like it's probably more important than how how great an engineer they are to be honest and so Gumroad you know we don't have meetings we don't do stano's we don't do any of this stuff we barely do email a little bit of slack mostly we live on notion and get up and I'll get more into that and of course because coronavirus but since 2015 we also haven't had an office and the way we've been able to get away with this just by just relying on and assuming that people can write every single person in the company can write really really really well and I'll start with this sort of the philosophy of my hub like of the way I think about writing and then we then I'll sort of give specific examples I think of how of how we may apply it this is kind of what I would tweet I would probably just tweet the first two sentences because it would be a little bit more controversial but I think that the the simple way to look at writing is that it's a it allows you to sort of think through ideas before you tell anybody else and I think conversations and and sort of real-time debates like the present presidential debates they're not really about ideas I think anyone that watches that stuff is there to be entertained maybe they really think that it's about ideas but I think it's sort of I assume obvious to anyone watching this that like it's not really about ideas it's about you know it's about ego it's about personality it's about charisma it's about who can you know be more witty and and sort of like training for this very specific skill of debating it's not about who's having the best idea at the time right and the reason is because you have to think on the fly that's ridiculous like you know we were talking about someone that we both know earlier who sort of like when he talks he he referenced things from all sorts of places and and that's how you sort of construct an argument you use data you source it you know you you know you say hey go watch this video there's this bit that's really interesting and it requires like this sort of lag time right because I send you all this information and then you process it you do a bunch of research you construct an argument that might take you a day or two you know you might have to sleep on it etc but if I'm having a conversation with with someone in person like if someone's like hey what is the right way to solve this problem like think I would not be able to answer that question it's like insane to me and so when when I think companies are running this way where you're you know over the over the launch table over the dinner table like the I don't think the best idea often wins I think the most charismatic person would power I would probably win a lot of those arguments you know because I'm relatively personable I can speak loudly I run the company like they're all these reasons but the text and text I think it levels the playing field quite a bit another way to say it is we we have a lot of thoughts we even write a lot of them out but but you know that what actually makes it through the filter of writing editing and publishing is very very little and that's kind of how I think about working at Gumroad like the actual stuff that you communicate to anybody else the more you put a filter on that and the bar sort of putting the by pretty high it creates like an incredible quality of all the stuff you read and that's why our slack is pretty minimal and how a lot of the stuff lives on on notion and github like I can just spend half a day reading sort of internal Gumroad stuff that we hope to make more public over time and I just learn from it because I'm reading like really well polished thoughts I'm not spending a ton of time like someone's you know giving me like their high level thoughts on all of these different things and when you're you know you're at a bar at a coffee shop like talking to people you're riffing on all these ideas you're going on tangents and you know whereas with with when you when you start to write it's a little bit like writing code right like you might have all these ideas and thought explorations and sort of different different architectural ideas in your head but when you actually say hey this thing is ready for review what do you think that what you're saying is I think this solves the problem right and I think that's that's what writings requires you to do is you have a very specific problem the goal of the writing is to say look this is the answer and it's just a different way of working I'm not saying even though I might sound like it that this is like necessarily better just for us works really well and it means that most people can spend their time actually doing doing doing the work that they want to do which is which is which is which is you know building stuff another way to look at it I come from a sort of technical background and I love this metaphor it falls flat on tons of people but in application programming there's there are sort of there's a way to scale right every database the database is sort of like the universal truth that's where all the data lives about your users customers all that stuff right and over time the app so the application like Gummer com hits the databases like hey this person wants to view this product we need to show it to them like what's the name of the product for example and over time as you grow basically that that that sort of the amount of times you're painting in a database like the database can't respond to all of those requests so you have to add a cache which is like hey actually the name of the product doesn't change that often you don't actually have to go all the way to the database to get this answer the database is all the way over there it's really expensive like just to talk to me and I'll tell you what what it is and I'll update myself like once a day or every time the database changes we can go update the cache or something right and this is how like most web applications scale in the beginning and the metaphor I love to you is like writing is the cache documentation is the cache code is the cache the people in the company me I'm the database and so the more that I can build a cache as hey instead of it let's say someone's like hey I need to figure out how to get paid or something I'm a freelancer or something like that like if they ask me that's expensive that takes time that might be stressful for them to do they might not do it instead you know we have a cache which is like you go to know she can go to the wake of the wiki that we have there and it says how do I get paid you click that thing it tells you this is how you get paid boom and so it just saves like a ton a ton of time like I don't I know I have friends that run companies and they spend all their time basically meetings or answering questions and gum words smaller typically than those but I think it just dramatically saves a ton a ton a ton of time and the way that we apply this to building Gumroad is similar and we the the support team is like the database again the people they're responding to all of these queries that come in like hey this doesn't work this doesn't work like I'm stuck with this I don't understand this just come or do this and the cache is is the content the writing again right like all this all the content in our Help Center and and on our website and within the product itself that says hey you don't actually have to talk to the team you can just talk to me I'll tell you the answer and every if the answer changes like I can go update myself instead of have to rely on the Help Center and this isn't perfect but you know the goal is to get basically to make the cache as accurate as possible so that the database can sort of be free to do it to do its thing and so it's it's it's a metaphor that I've tried to communicate on Twitter and it's never worked and one day I hope to hope to nail it but this is this is what I really really like to talk about how I write and how I sort of recommend everybody write Twitter is basically if you use Twitter this is kind of what happens but this is how we think about recruiting support shipping products sometimes too but it's basically like put all of the ideas out there like I call them vomit drafts basically I vomit out every single idea that I have this is how I wrote that reflecting on my family to build a billion-dollar company article I just spent one Saturday like six or seven hours just like dumping every single I mean this is eight years with my life so I just don't every single idea that I had what like any interesting thing I asked people on Twitter like hey what do you want this thing to talk about and they gave me it you know 4050 people responded and so I like to try to answer all those questions and then I would basically I sort of tried to format it and then I send it out I sent it out to to those forty people saying hey did this answer your question you know again like this this article has one goal which is to answer your question like did it solve that problem for you and often it did not and so I would go back and do it again and hit or in an iterate and iterate and this is basically how we do everything which is like get an answer out there and then get feedback on it which is like hey this didn't answer my question or like you know people for whatever reason seemed to not get get to this answer or what have you they keep back sort of hitting the database and then over time you get you can sort of like improve improve on that and then the other I think it's really important is to actually hit publish I think a lot of folks they just get stuck and like editing the same thing over and over again and starting is definitely the hardest thing like most people don't even start so writing that's super key but I think hitting publish and then paying attention sort of strategically to like how that sort of you know how that affected the world what the impact was is also is also really really really important and it's important in in like a way that I think qualitative feedback isn't I think quantitative feedback is like how many you know there are support ball you go down or these how many engineers applied etcetera like these are these are real metrics that are ultimately going to be more important I think that the than the anecdotal data I think go back to that I think one of the I think one of the really important things that I want to double down here on and emphasize is so I spend a lot of time at the Met in New York City where I live it's my favorite Museum in the world I try to go once a month and when you walk in and you go left they have all these statues of people from ancient Greece and they're just absolutely beautiful not only are the bodies beautiful but the way that they convey emotion and and then the way that the statues are chiseled is just incredible what they're able to do with marble and I think that one of the things that humbles me when I look at those statues is that I don't know all the work all the processed knowledge that has gone into making those statues as beautiful as they are and I think that it's the same thing with writing what I want to double down on here is you're seeing all of the beautiful Greek statues you're seeing saw Hills article that was read more than five hundred thousand times and you're saying well I can't do that in my first draft so I have no shot here and what you're not seeing is after Sawhill spent eight hours actually writing that edit after edit after edit and he actually shared one of the early drafts of that on twitter and it's not nearly as good as the other one the one that he actually published and so what I want to double down on here is that you're seeing those we're just statues but they started off as just a big boxy box of marble and it turned into something good yeah exactly no that's exactly right like I write other things like science fiction and stuff and I always have to remind myself that I've never really read like a published authors first draft because it would never make its way to me right and that's why I think with writing like having a group of people that you're learning to write with together is super key because you can actually pick up on some of that stuff and there's so much learning to be had about the early early work because you're like oh I make that mistake too wait I should probably stop you know and that's yeah that's super super key and so this is you know this is what David was talking about where I published the diff of I think the first or second draft I think maybe one revision cycle with my writing group on this essay was is the one on the left and then the right is the one that is why unpublished and so I can I can read it just to give you like I think you can see it but reading it you'll really I think get a sense of it which is so I'll do that about three years ago I woke up to an article about gum Uruk normally I like these sorts of days but this one was about me laying off my vast majority of my company on top of that I had to answer a lot of emails into each term our creators many asking if they should start looking for an alternative in the new one in 2011 I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest before I vested any of my stock to work on what I thought would be my life's work and just reading it I think you can get a sense of like just how how much more streamlined it is and how like you can I think the idea is the same right which is basically there's there's I wanted to build this big thing I spent a bunch of years building it and then I failed to do that and in the first one I think there's a lot there's a lot of problems I think with the with the first one but I think the biggest one is like the reader has no like has there's just too many ideas you know I was talking about that one idea that's sort of the theme that I'll go back to over and over and over again and I just wasn't an idea there I was trying to communicate that you know I was doing these layoffs for this company I had spent a bunch of years building that was really now I was a public failure like all of these things and even you can see this the second paragraph I say and like I had left my job at Pinterest but you know things like for example like it's all relative in the in the first draft about three years I guess about three years ago I should have said five years before that I had left it wasn't grounded at all I needed to sort of so I started in 2011 and there's there's all there's all these things I can really get into but I think the core of it is basically I wanted to communicate that I had spent nine years trying to build this company and I went through I think 40 or something drafts of like how do i how do I make this point as effectively as possible and you know it was basically a well start at the beginning seems obvious again that you look at the statue and it's sort of obvious like what the answer would have been but basically it was like this is an article about about failing the build building gummer it into a billion dollar company I know exactly where to start which is the beginning right but it's it's it's it's one of those things that took took a long time to a long time to get to and there's other other other things I tried to do but that's sort of a simple example I think to make that point just like it's not about like writing a super key but it really is editing and I think the other thing that I think hopefully you got a sense of when you were listening to that it is like I really want writing to be simple I think at least personally I think the goal of writing should be basically to not even exist so that you're you're you're in here being like okay so I just left his job it and yours he just gave up millions of dollars worth of stock to start god that's a very clear idea that the language I don't think anyone would look at that and be like that is a phenomenal sentence you know but in the in a big one in the first one it maybe it's like more interesting literary I use like bought and about normally and like you know like I was using these time things I was doing in media res and blah blah blah but the idea was lost you know the idea and and the idea is powerful like the I think the idea and I think this is why hundreds of thousands of people have read that article is because the idea is relatable and so the more you can get out of the way basically the more that the audience can speak can look at directly at the idea and find that interest or not I think often you have ideas that you know the word in fiction is often purple for us we're like the prose is so beautiful but the idea is actually are incredibly weak and sometimes you see this with apps you design this beautiful beautiful beautiful app and it goes viral and everyone uses in it's amazing and then like three months later no one's using anymore and the reason might be people were not obsessed with the idea of the app they were just obsessed with how awesome the app itself was and that's never the goal the goal should be that people people you know tell me all the time like I loved reading that thing was the best thing I've ever written I've ever read but whatever and it's like no like this story I think was really captivating really interesting and relatable like I would ask them to recite a single sentence I doubt they would be able to people to do that so I think that's really really key and and and I think a lot of people are scared of this I think a lot of people are scared to simplify their writing because maybe they have their ideas aren't that strong which is fine that your ideas get better over time but only if you allow them to breathe and and to really sort of be honest I think with them so I talked about this but the way I sort of translate this to building a product is is the same thing which is gummer is basically about a singular idea and every business is is about a single idea right this is the mission or the vision of the company the Gumroad is about like I believe that all creators should be able to make a living doing what they love which is creating and they you know that's really hard to like let's just make it as easy as easy as possible that's a really simple idea though took a long time for us to get to I think the first time I was like when I launched that Monday morning I was like Gumroad it you know let's you share a link to monetize your digital products or sell directly to your audience or something like that it was just you know and it took years and years and years and you can find if you google what is Gummer a medium you'll find like a little article I wrote which is basically just me taking the what the one sentence on the homepage and like every year and you'll see it kind of kind of simplify and hone into that idea but you're never gonna I think people just they think they're gonna get to that idea immediately if they just sit and think but no just like it took nine years of me iterating on the idea to actually you sort of get to that to get to that point does another tweet that I really I really like right like your audience is smart this goes to the same point you should always write like yours audience is smart because why would you want to write for people that aren't and you're not that important to them like they have a goal they want to get to that goal you they want you I assume you or your product or what have you to solve the problem and so like you know like sort of leave your ego at the door solve the problem give them the answer and then and then hopefully it's the answer they're looking for if it's not they'll go find it somewhere else but I think this is sort of a really good proxy like am I wasting anybody's time right yeah one of the just go back to that one of the things that I that I do is when I write I'll pick one person to write for and I actually just have five people who I switch off between so I just imagined for example okay I'm writing this for Marc Andreessen Marc Andreessen is super smart super critical doesn't have a lot of time and is somebody who also is intellectually generous so I know that I don't have to go explain what an API is because I'm writing for Marc Andreessen and he built he's a really smart guy he built Netscape and so my point in saying that is a lot of the time when you get writer's block and you don't know you're stuck in your writing and you don't know where to go next it's because you don't know who you're writing for and there's this very paradoxical thing in writing where you know I see this with my writing students all the time I will have a perspective student send me an email lavishly written I I mean this thing is out of the Library of Congress and they have these beautiful sentence structures the way the paragraphs flow together and I'm like oh my goodness this person is gonna be one of my students and then week three right I mean I'm intimidated week three they're like David I have the worst writer's block I can't get a single word out and what I always tell them is if you can pick one person to write for the reason that that email was so strong was because you were writing for me and so to get back to this tweet just imagine somebody who's smart imagine somebody who's busy and it'll make your writing a lot easier even if you're writing for but consumption one person totally totally hundred percent agree with that I think the other thing I would add is just what is that and I think it goes directly with your point which is like what is that what is the problem you're trying to solve for that person like right like what what does mark and you should need to learn or need to know that would make his life better easier smoother faster cheaper whatever right and so I just again being honest with yourself and I think the writing I think people get stuck on the word so often right writing is about words but it's not really about words like that's like the final step I think that you know like the last draft where I'm cleaning everything up and tightening moving removing all the you know adverbs and things like that that's not hard like computers will do that for you over time the hard part is like refining your your your understanding of an idea you know that's really really really hard and and I think you're right like a big part of the idea it's like well who-who is it for I was in Hollywood for six months last year and the number one question everybody asks you about any project is like what's the down like what's the demographic is this for a four to six it's like 8 to 12 8 to 11 I think it is technically is it you know is this young adult is this adult is this new adult they were trying to make for you know it's all you know it's it's and you're like I'm just writing I just want to write about this but it's like no you're you're writing for a group of people and I think people are scared also with that for some reason everyone wants to write the next Harry Potter right and and and it's it's well it's like well the person who wrote Harry Potter I didn't know is gonna be Harry Potter II just write right for this one person and if it happens it happens but it's probably not it's like worrying about it it's kind of like building million-dollar company it's a little bit maybe it's it's a weird sort of goal that might might reveal too much about how egotistic you are and maybe you need to and so speaking of of who write speaking speaking of the audience like I'll go through a few examples of how we use words specifically to find customers and you know the sort of standard title for this would be something like content marketing but I think the problem with content marketing is I never had done it like I didn't understand that that's what I was doing all the time when I was tweeting when I wrote that that that post on medium but every time I was I was I was building a customer base I think the problem that I have with content marketing one it feels very absurd sort of too goal-oriented I raise like goals so much I'm on that hippy bandwagon right now but it's really like I think it's it's too optimistic it's like I'm gonna write this thing because I think people will read this and then they're gonna they're gonna be the perfect people that sign up for gum read and they're gonna make some money right and so on the way I think about it now is like I just want to help people I just want to help creators cuz I like craters I do really do it's not a coincidence that I vote gum room and I want to hang out them I want to meet them and I want to you know I want to learn from them and I want to take their learnings and repurpose them and then share them as my own writings and so like that's the mo and like we literally have zero growth focus at the company it's just about like who can I be friends with who can I help you know who can I hang out with who can I be you know build a relationship with that's gonna last for a long time and it's been so much more effective because at the end of the day you don't know who is going to be a customer for you you don't even know they don't even know they're gonna be a customer for you I get people all the time that are like I have no you know I like I'm never gonna use Gummer it makes no sense but I really love her tweets and then like three months later that okay I destroyed a book why because they probably saw this content I was creating Drive like you know and all these maybe you and other folks like you know sharing sharing the fact that this is even possible like and so on I think it takes longer right it takes longer I think this approach but like if when it works it it's free and it and it works it scales so much so much better and so to go to the hard numbers now almost seven hundred thousand people have read that on medium and it's been syndicated to a few spots so I know 750,000 people maybe have at least viewed the article who knows like how many people apparently according to medium 222,000 of read all the way down at the bottom has like a hundred thousand claps I've only seen one story more than that so this is some data that shows like I can I can do this and you know that across the border was a science fiction story I didn't really expect anyone to read that anyways I'm sure the only people that actually read are the people that one of these other two articles but it works like this is an incredibly effective strategy how many of those 700,000 people like now know what Gummer it is like some of them you know quite quite a few this is like the gum word growth again I can't sort of say oh this is the the direct impact of this but I know that hundreds of thousands of people certainly because of that article and definitely because of now know what Gummer it is and this is what advertising is this is what nike spends all this money on is to just know by the way Nike makes shoes that are awesome especially if you're athletic right and so it's the same idea like every not everyone knows gum right but like a lot of people now know that ho Gummer it helps creators well I don't know but like the next time someone in that group of people has that problem they're gonna think about Gummer and i think you can start to see that there's some lifts happening because of that article and other things and it was really just me being like hey can i help people like i have eight years worth of stuff that i've learned that i have not shared because i was afraid to share it what happens if i share it you know I'll just write again I'll just write for my mom she was like my primary audience so I just need to tell her was this happen so she doesn't lose her mind cuz you know I never had this conversation with her about what had happened to the company and being a failure in blah blah blah and and then guess what all these other people write it too is same thing with building a product like build for one person I don't come work for myself you know build for someone you really care about and then there is probably other people like it's statistically unlikely that you are literally the only person that has this problem yeah I want to I want to double down on that idea of building for yourself and then you end up building for other people so this is a something that I'm gonna talk about in a couple minutes but I have a friend and his name is Andy and Andy is I think he's 22 years old and when he was in high school he started just building Instagram accounts that he thought was cool and he ended up being the first to get certain handles on Instagram so he got a handle called at earth and obviously an amazing handle and just started posting stuff that matched his own aesthetic and he was one of those tumblr teens and spending a lot of time there ended up building Instagram his handle on earth on Instagram to 1.3 million followers then launched a company I ran into him summer of 2018 summer of 2018 and I said hey what are you building Andy and he said well you know I've been talking to my Instagram friends and I've just gotten kind of bored of posting on the main feed on Instagram and there's this real problem now where I'm just don't like posting so I want to make stories but every time I go make a story well it's really hard and it's hard for me to make it beautiful so you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go make an Instagram storage creator that was summer of 2018 November of last year this would have been about eighteen months later he calls me he goes hey David I need your help I'm selling my business to Squarespace and for a lot of money and I'm about to get very wealthy and I need your help here to find this lawyer so in eighteen months he went from this little app to this massive company now when he sold it the app had more than 25 million users more than two million of them were on paid subscription and he just bought a big house in Tribeca and what he did was he built an app that suited him didn't think about the market but he said this is something I want I'm gonna build it and it turned out that all these other people wanted it totally yeah and and honestly like the people who really want to build for everybody very rarely do anyways it doesn't it doesn't really work I think otherwise everyone would do it all the time right like that that would be great raising money I wanted to talk briefly about this I will start to echo myself because I think it is really again simple idea but it's the same idea like look people will discover you people will follow you and this is a fact like most investors the meeting now with coronavirus the meeting is totally irrelevant basically I guess people do video meetings and stuff but like when I raise money and when I talk to like my favorite investors when like the meeting is the thing that you do to like celebrate the fact that they're putting money into your company like they're already convinced because they built they followed you for a long time they like your ideas they know that you work hard most investments they make they know twelve eighteen months in that this stranger has run off their money or like it built something stupid or like you know like this happens way too way up way way more often than you might think because obviously why would they publicize those stories right and so building an audience and this is also why it's super hard if you if have a great idea and I get diem xuong off three or four and today they're like hey I had this idea I'm raising money and I'm like I don't know you like I'm you're a stranger to me like that's like being like hey can I have $10,000 like that's kind of a big asked for it from a stranger right so like hey well why don't you go write and a phenomenal article about something and send it to me and I will read it and if it's great I'll give you $10,000 it's like no joke and guess how many people do it very very very very very few people and so you know when I raise money for Gumroad like you know I raise like 10 million bucks and I was 19 but I had you know years of a blog and you know I had credibility I had a reputation that like it was unlikely that I would sort of run off and disappear disappear with the money in it you could read my ideas you could say okay he's thinking about this problem of demurrer democratizing commerce like in this interesting way I haven't thought about it like this and this is how I invest by the way is if I learned something from a meeting and I want to like how would you want to learn more from that person like I'm very I'm very likely to be a yes and it's kind of the same thing it's like investors they don't just invest to make a lot of money a lot of them already have more money than they know what to do it they want to learn they want to meet interesting people and so the more that you can prove to people that you're gonna do that the better off you are the other thing I think is is when you raise money via words when you're writing a lot of e-mails back and forth and you're explaining things and you're using notion memos and like I'm working to write different within the government umbrella but I have this like b2b idea that I'm thinking about and I can write this vowel that's like this is a promise the solution this is why it's interesting and I can send it to people and then they can comment it up and I have all this documentation that's like this is this was the initial idea just like that dip I you know I could I can literally see how I've improved over time as a writer and I think that's super key because then you can start drawing the line like oh like I was really complex sort of sentence structures and I'm getting simpler but what's likely to be true is like I can get even more simple right like there is a you can start drawing that line into the future which i think is really exciting and I think the other sort of caveat is a lot of people like they're like you're playing a game like I don't wanna play the game I just want to build stuff and it's like what do you have to play like this is a game raising money is a game there's a few people that play the game if you want to do it do it well otherwise just find a different game you know I'm you don't do raise money but I wanted to just talk about this briefly because I do get do get a lot of a lot of requests about this the other thing is just people are scared of like telling me the idea or like I don't know why they sent me a deck or whatever just like tell me the idea I had this problem this is my solution I want to hire people so I have to raise money I'm raising this much money because it lets me you know it's like it's not that simple and I think people like they they want their I think they're using it as bait to be like hey if you agree to that the phone call or this or that like I'll take the meeting no I want just tell me just tell me and if it's interesting I you know I will want more and so I think it's same thing you're like don't be afraid just like put up put everything out there you know like people ask me why am I still open with the gummer numbers like don't you don't use are you scared people are gonna copy and people have been copying us for a long time I'm not scared of being copied I'm scared of someone thinking about a totally different for me they're probably not even paying attention to like my board and then same thing this applies with with with recruiting too it's same thing building an audience guess what if I tweet it today as I did less than a year ago like 900 almost a thousand retweets think this thing was seen by 500,000 people like no job post on a startups website has been seen by this many people and guess what it was free I have to do any job I'm never doing by the way I'm never paying for a job at again and like if I if I and you know if I tweeted this again it would do it would do quite well hundreds of thousands people would see it because why because I've shown people that I'm like an interesting person I they people know what gummer it is this is a thing that I've you know I've sort of built over time built an audience and so a lot of that work like a lot of what recruiting processes are focused on traditionally I've already done like I've already started the recruiting funnel effectively for hundreds of thousands of people right and I'm always I'm always learning I'm always trying to yeah trying to improve the other thing that's interesting I think is the point of raising money up this way is to get more meetings right you get straight to the point you're gonna get more meetings the point of recruiting with words is same thing same same thing you're trying to do which is to get straight to the point but you actually want less meetings out of this and this serves basically the same purpose which is look there are a ton of people that don't want to work for you they don't they think Gummer's weird that's great because I I have time I have a limited amount of time I don't wanna meet with people that think I'm her it is weird in the bad way and so I tweet something like this and people are like I assume eighty ninety percent of people are like no schedule meetings no deadlines like no I don't want I don't want this for myself and then that's great and I think this goes to your point about about about you know building for one person it's kind of the same thing I think you want to alienate people with your ideas your ideas are not for everybody your company's not for everybody your product is not for everybody and so I actually think the more you can alienate the better because then you can just focus on making something really really awesome like this company that's amazing for new moms we just had a newborn like and you the meetings are like you do they just don't work you have to breastfeed if do all these other things you're too nervous it's not and so you know so something like this can be can be really really appealing and a lot of people responded negatively to this they said you know what about you guys or whatever I never said only but you know you're gonna get some flak um the other the other thing I'd like to point out is this this is a tweet that I would not tweet it a year ago because I didn't understand how Twitter worked at it like this is not an accident that this tweet went viral right like I learned about how Twitter works I learned about quote tweeting and like you know like if you're a new mom we're hiring like I'm signaling very clearly in the beginning I know it's gonna be controversial I put the money amount in there right away like this stuff doesn't happen on accident and so this is something that I've improved that over and over again and you can look at my feet a lot of the stuff I say it goes viral it's not accidental but it's also not copy/paste Bowl like you can't just go do this you're gonna have to get you know you're gonna have to get to a similar position on a different mountain like you'llyou'll and and that that comes just from from from doing it and getting there and then culture same thing like again like I want to mean with less people I want to put as much of the culture out there document everything put it out there get feedback and then I could just do my deep work part of my day is like I I try to update the road map I try to update all the wiki stuff I want that to be super accurate um and so I can just do my work people don't bug me customers have another reason to fall in love with Gummer because now it's a whole new dimension of the company that they get exposed to not just the product and the logo and the Twitter account but now this is like internal company stuff and then the other really nice thing about doing this is everyone you know can learn for me like I get like they're not just learning from like my tweaks but I can say hey this is like an internal note about how I got to this product decision or how I think about memberships or how I think about education I was listening to your podcast with Thiago that on education is phenomenal and I made some notes I made some edits to our roadmap based on that and guess what like everyone in the company can go can learn like you know some of these insights without having to go all the way to the source material right and so I think there's so many ways I could talk forever about like how effective how effective it is to write things down and make them public and share them and and get feedback on them this is an example of the roadmap and kind of what it looks like if anyone wants a link I can share it in the chat or whatever but it's not crazy and again it looks maybe so simple but it took time to sort of Whittle it down and you know again just wanted to highlight like very clear single purpose which is like keyboard I literally say keep our goal in mind as you read like every single sentence every single thing we build is about helping creators earn more money really simple really really really simple you know this is like zooming in on you can click on memberships and you know obviously there are books there's like layers of the of the of the fidelity so you can get into memberships and you know I talk about what's above this page just to tell you well you know what we have to ship until we can launch memberships which is our patreon competitor why you know things like that it's really really simple anyways this is way longer than 20 minutes so like the last thought kind of said at the beginning I'll just reiterate which is literally everybody is writing you're writing all the time you're writing emails and tweets and texts to friends so you might as well write really really well if you can write well it probably means you understand the things you're writing about really well and if you understand things you're writing about really well there's a much higher likelihood you're gonna be successful and maybe even happy because at the end of the day you spent a huge amount of time by yourself thinking thoughts you probably spend more time with yourself than anybody else or at least you should and so if you have good good thoughts good ideas you're interesting to yourself like you're just gonna be in a better place more people are gonna want to work for you more people are gonna want to invest in your company more you're probably gonna be able to build a better product more people are gonna want to use more people are gonna follow you on twitter like whatever your other goals are I really believe like this it all starts from that fountain so yeah that was hopefully good I have more thoughts on Twitter you can follow my gummer newsletter if you want I've sort of run out of things to write coincidentally on that so if you have any ideas for what what you want from either I'm happy to do it otherwise you have thanks for thanks for listening fantastic I love that idea of being interesting to yourself that's uh that's a really good place to to just way to think about how to consume ideas how to take on projects cuz if you're interesting to yourself you're gonna be interesting to other people it's very hard to be - like to fake it basically right like if you look if you think about who you follow on Twitter that you really love following it's unlikely just because their tweets are great it's because like their tweets are great but they're great because of black right they have history they have experience they have you know they've struggled your stuff you know that's what makes them interesting and and and the tweets are kind of like the the side effect of that right so yeah it's super super important and you yeah it's like just become interesting the best writers always I mean with whenever I hang out with writers I'm like oh no what of course this is you wrote this book like it's so clear from your life experience that this you know it's so like happens over and over and over it's not a quest that's for sure absolutely alright I'm gonna share my screen yeah I really like that idea that that people's art ends up becoming a manifestation of who they are and you know I I think about this all the time people like God David you're a writer and I'm like I'm not a writer like I communicate through writing but the way that I live I then communicate through writing but I'm really the way that I think is like I'm a thinker I'm a doer and that's where all my energy goes into taking on more interesting projects into having more interesting food more interesting experiences and then the energy then gets channeled through the words but to call myself a writer at as as how I define myself as always felt so limiting mm-hmm yeah I don't agree with that okay so I'm gonna share my key notes here one second okay so you can see that yeah okay great so I'm going to talk about something talked about what do you do when you actually have a business and how do you think about doing strategy and thinking through quarterly reviews and thinking through notions stuff like that and actually running the business I'm going to talk about growing the business how do you actually find people so I have a quick agenda first we're going to talk about painting then we're gonna talk about music then we're gonna talk about the radio and then we're gonna talk about personal monopolies so you've never seen anything any kind of writing system like this so first I'm gonna share my favorite painting in the entire world by Paulson yack no Dada Dada Lagarde so this is what's called a pointillist painting and I am in love with this painting I saw it at the Met it stands in the Impressionist wing on the southern side I just think it's the most beautiful thing that has ever been created like it's always hard for me not to like look at this and even not get emotional I mean I just like the colors and it hangs up in my room so I have all these memories with this painting now and I think that from a panoramic perspective like looking away low-resolution like it's very pretty but what I want to do as it pertains to writing is talk about the construction of this painting so I took these photos when I was at the Met a couple weeks ago and I'm gonna zoom in on the bottom left side first and what you you see these two boats right there I'm gonna zoom in and watch what happens watch the way that the paintbrushes go on the page what you see is you see these these these brushes that are they're not pointy they're kind of dashing across each brush is fairly different from the next you have yellows next to Greens next two oranges next to Blues next to purples and when you look away it doesn't quite look like that but once you kind of jump in you see this pointillist style and once again here is another section of the painting it's all kind of very textured thicker brush strokes and so I think that this is a really good metaphor to to to start thinking about how we write so with this painting what you see is if you go to it closely you see these dark kind of coarse-grained paint brushes on the foreground and then as it goes towards the background it's it's much finer and I love this sort of luminous and vibrant aesthetic that comes from this this painting that I love so much and so what I want to do is I want to remind you that your content strategy is really just that big painting made up of all these little pointillist dots and so first what I want to do is I want to give you a picture of your business and this is what it looks like where basically you're standing there and you have a solution and there's all these people out there out in the world and what's happening is you have a solution and you're saying okay customers I want you to sign up and give me some money in exchange I will help to solve your problem and what do people try to do the first will place that everybody goes is they try to reach everybody where they go out and they're gonna say ah I want every single person in the entire world to be my customer as if you're building Amazon Prime but that's not what we're doing here we're trying to build internet style businesses that give you an incredible life that probably do multi million dollars a year nobody knows who you are and you get to live wherever you want you have these FAT FAT FAT margins and you to take care of your family you get to buy your mom a house you get to take your dad on a trip and you get to make sure that your kids live an awesome life so I'm really talking now about building internet businesses like rite of passage and Gumroad so what should you do instead well what you should do is you should teach and I'm reminded of a quote from a guy named Nathan berry and he is the CEO of a company called convertkit and convertkit is the platform where I host my newsletters really profitable business sort of like Gumroad the average person hasn't heard of it but it's a very interesting company that is changing the lives of creators all around the world and he has this great quote where he says if you know a skill that other people use to make money you can make a living by teaching that skill think through the people who are well known in your industry what do you know why do you know who they are are they the most talented well sometimes but often not almost always it's because they teach and so what I want to do is I want to ground this in teaching so where are we right now we're trying to create this big painting and each individual teaching session is just one brushstroke so what does that actually look like well what you want to do is you want to attract people most people think you know what I'm gonna go find people but people will actually opt-in and they will raise their hand and as you can see here it's a very small percentage of people but there's so many people on the internet that your customer base can still be huge and then what will happen is the audience will grow and the percentage of people that you attract will still be fairly small but there'll be word-of-mouth and even as your audience grows you'll attract more people and then soon soon enough what's going to happen is you are going to look like when I and in our most recent rite-of-passage we had students for more than 28 different countries and if I were to look at a map of our student base it looks something like this where we have people all over the world we have people in Asia people in Australia people in Africa South America North America even the people watching this right now follow this kind of map and then there's always that one Australian guy who goes you forgot about me mate and he's standing there and he comes right in and even Australian cyclist guy is right here so my point is ok you forgot about me my guy time to get you off the screen my point is that I don't want you to create customers with your content I want you to create fans and once you actually have fans of your company something really interesting begins to happen where what you do is you're just in the middle and you're trying to reach all these different kinds of people you're trying to figure out who's gonna be interested in what I'm doing and remember you're starting off and you're saying I need customers but the problem is the mistake that I see people making over and over and over again is they shout in all directions and look what happens to the people they shout so loud they shout in every single direction without regard to what the radio wave or the frequency or the message that they're trying to say and look people begin to move away that's not what you want to do instead of shouting instead of having people moving away you don't want to shout you want to play music and something really interesting happens when you begin to play music you pick up your saxophone you pick up your trumpet you pick up your piano you pick up your guitar and you begin to share an orchestra of observations tweets videos podcasts articles workshops you can reach the entire world you can reach people in Asia you can reach people in Australia you can reach people in Africa you can reach people in South America and you can reach people in North America and then what you begin to be able to do once you begin to play music is you have all of these different people in a band so here you got the drummer whose kid who's keeping the the pace and all you're doing is you're starting off with just a couple notes so you're right here you're just playing ding ding that first thing is a tweet second one is an essay then what ends up happening is you're attracting people from everywhere so now what happens to our circle of friends the people who we want in our community well once you start playing notes well at first everyone's gonna listen you see it on this map people will tune in but you know what most people they people will give you one shot but most people you know what it's just not right and they're gonna start listening and this is what will happen some people will come in and they'll be part of your tribe and other people will say you know what I am NOT really thrilled this isn't what's right for me and that's totally ok and then you keep growing people stay in your circle and as the clock rolls and the clock continues more and more people come around so now you have all these people and your filter gets bigger and bigger where that filter is the sound it is the the resonance of your music and look most people are outside of your circle and that is totally ok in fact it's totally expected but as the clock rolls what you want to keep doing is keep playing music tweets articles blog posts essays podcasts just keep that guitar playing and so what I want to do here is I want to switch into an idea that I call the paradox of specificity and there's a great story from a book called Moneyball and just to frame the context here is that people whether you're creative whether you're a business owner you fear specificity you relish these wide-open territories but the problem is instead of picking a path and making a commitment creatives business owners they stay in limbo but I'll tell you and this is 01:0:0,180 --> 01:0:2,290 01:0:0,190 --> 01:0:6,220 where the paradox of specificity becomes 01:0:2,280 --> 01:0:6,220 01:0:2,290 --> 01:0:9,369 insightful that specializing often leads 01:0:6,210 --> 01:0:9,369 01:0:6,220 --> 01:0:12,150 to more options in the long run than you 01:0:9,359 --> 01:0:12,150 01:0:9,369 --> 01:0:15,490 thought and due to their clarity 01:0:12,140 --> 01:0:15,490 01:0:12,150 --> 01:0:17,619 specific goals galvanize support why 01:0:15,480 --> 01:0:17,619 01:0:15,490 --> 01:0:19,859 because they're easy to remember them 01:0:17,609 --> 01:0:19,859 01:0:17,619 --> 01:0:22,510 and as we chase them as we pursue them 01:0:19,849 --> 01:0:22,510 01:0:19,859 --> 01:0:25,270 actually the goals begin to grow and 01:0:22,500 --> 01:0:25,270 01:0:22,510 --> 01:0:26,800 saviola I'm curious for you with with 01:0:25,260 --> 01:0:26,800 01:0:25,270 --> 01:0:29,440 with Gumroad it might be a good time for 01:0:26,790 --> 01:0:29,440 01:0:26,800 --> 01:0:31,780 you to pitch in yeah this was hasn't 01:0:29,430 --> 01:0:31,780 01:0:29,440 --> 01:0:33,400 Gumroad expanded in some way so far 01:0:31,770 --> 01:0:33,400 01:0:31,780 --> 01:0:35,770 beyond what you ever imagined at the 01:0:33,390 --> 01:0:35,770 01:0:33,400 --> 01:0:38,410 beginning yeah no I think this is a 01:0:35,760 --> 01:0:38,410 01:0:35,770 --> 01:0:40,510 really interesting idea that the the it 01:0:38,400 --> 01:0:40,510 01:0:38,410 --> 01:0:43,060 feels like we've actually narrowed our 01:0:40,500 --> 01:0:43,060 01:0:40,510 --> 01:0:45,910 focus over time but for some reason that 01:0:43,050 --> 01:0:45,910 01:0:43,060 --> 01:0:48,040 leads to like more growth you know it's 01:0:45,900 --> 01:0:48,040 01:0:45,910 --> 01:0:49,119 like and a lot of what I've been doing 01:0:48,030 --> 01:0:49,119 01:0:48,040 --> 01:0:50,680 actually is like going through the 01:0:49,109 --> 01:0:50,680 01:0:49,119 --> 01:0:51,700 product and it's like I don't know if we 01:0:50,670 --> 01:0:51,700 01:0:50,680 --> 01:0:54,339 need this I don't know if we need that 01:0:51,690 --> 01:0:54,339 01:0:51,700 --> 01:0:56,380 like 30 people use this 800 people use 01:0:54,329 --> 01:0:56,380 01:0:54,339 --> 01:0:58,119 this you know like let's see if we can 01:0:56,370 --> 01:0:58,119 01:0:56,380 --> 01:1:1,060 consolidate let's see if we can get rid 01:0:58,109 --> 01:1:1,060 01:0:58,119 --> 01:1:2,980 of and I think it's just it's just like 01:1:1,050 --> 01:1:2,980 01:1:1,060 --> 01:1:4,540 anything like people people want to 01:1:2,970 --> 01:1:4,540 01:1:2,980 --> 01:1:6,760 spend their time either with things they 01:1:4,530 --> 01:1:6,760 01:1:4,540 --> 01:1:7,869 love or you know they don't spend their 01:1:6,750 --> 01:1:7,869 01:1:6,760 --> 01:1:9,940 time with things they like so I think 01:1:7,859 --> 01:1:9,940 01:1:7,869 --> 01:1:12,339 it's kind of a move should try to be 01:1:9,930 --> 01:1:12,339 01:1:9,940 --> 01:1:13,569 like liked by 300 people instead of 01:1:12,329 --> 01:1:13,569 01:1:12,339 --> 01:1:15,190 loved by a hundred 01:1:13,559 --> 01:1:15,190 01:1:13,569 --> 01:1:16,660 you're just gonna be no no one's gonna 01:1:15,180 --> 01:1:16,660 01:1:15,190 --> 01:1:20,880 no one's gonna care especially in the 01:1:16,650 --> 01:1:20,880 01:1:16,660 --> 01:1:24,579 early days so another season yeah 01:1:20,870 --> 01:1:24,579 01:1:20,880 --> 01:1:26,079 absolutely so the my favorite story 01:1:24,569 --> 01:1:26,079 01:1:24,579 --> 01:1:28,690 about this is from a book called 01:1:26,069 --> 01:1:28,690 01:1:26,079 --> 01:1:30,940 Moneyball and it goes back and there's a 01:1:28,680 --> 01:1:30,940 01:1:28,690 --> 01:1:34,569 story in the book about a guy named Bill 01:1:30,930 --> 01:1:34,569 01:1:30,940 --> 01:1:36,579 James and Michael Lewis writes right 01:1:34,559 --> 01:1:36,579 01:1:34,569 --> 01:1:39,880 from the start Bill James assumed he had 01:1:36,569 --> 01:1:39,880 01:1:36,579 --> 01:1:42,280 been writing for not a mass audience but 01:1:39,870 --> 01:1:42,280 01:1:39,880 --> 01:1:45,250 a tiny group of people intensely 01:1:42,270 --> 01:1:45,250 01:1:42,280 --> 01:1:49,869 interested in baseball so let me tell 01:1:45,240 --> 01:1:49,869 01:1:45,250 --> 01:1:52,390 the story of Bill James so in 1977 this 01:1:49,859 --> 01:1:52,390 01:1:49,869 --> 01:1:54,099 guy named Bill James a statistician 01:1:52,380 --> 01:1:54,099 01:1:52,390 --> 01:1:58,119 who's really at wrist in baseball 01:1:54,089 --> 01:1:58,119 01:1:54,099 --> 01:2:0,790 publishes a book with the absolutely got 01:1:58,109 --> 01:2:0,790 01:1:58,119 --> 01:2:3,730 honest boring title of baseball abstract 01:2:0,780 --> 01:2:3,730 01:2:0,790 --> 01:2:5,859 featuring 18 categories of statistical 01:2:3,720 --> 01:2:5,859 01:2:3,730 --> 01:2:8,500 information that you can't find anywhere 01:2:5,849 --> 01:2:8,500 01:2:5,859 --> 01:2:10,119 else if I just put you to sleep I don't 01:2:8,490 --> 01:2:10,119 01:2:8,500 --> 01:2:12,970 blame you it's like watching golf on 01:2:10,109 --> 01:2:12,970 01:2:10,119 --> 01:2:14,080 television but he published his first 01:2:12,960 --> 01:2:14,080 01:2:12,970 --> 01:2:17,050 review 01:2:14,070 --> 01:2:17,050 01:2:14,080 --> 01:2:21,430 and he sold 77 copies in his first year 01:2:17,040 --> 01:2:21,430 01:2:17,050 --> 01:2:24,520 then next year he sold 250 so not that 01:2:21,420 --> 01:2:24,520 01:2:21,430 --> 01:2:26,860 many copies but eventually something 01:2:24,510 --> 01:2:26,860 01:2:24,520 --> 01:2:28,780 really interesting happened he started 01:2:26,850 --> 01:2:28,780 01:2:26,860 --> 01:2:30,610 receiving inquiries from all these 01:2:28,770 --> 01:2:30,610 01:2:28,780 --> 01:2:32,770 people from around the world who were 01:2:30,600 --> 01:2:32,770 01:2:30,610 --> 01:2:36,730 intensely interested in baseball 01:2:32,760 --> 01:2:36,730 01:2:32,770 --> 01:2:39,340 statistics and what's fascinating is he 01:2:36,720 --> 01:2:39,340 01:2:36,730 --> 01:2:42,790 wasn't just receiving interest from 01:2:39,330 --> 01:2:42,790 01:2:39,340 --> 01:2:46,420 people who had a job in baseball he was 01:2:42,780 --> 01:2:46,420 01:2:42,790 --> 01:2:48,130 receiving interest from traders who had 01:2:46,410 --> 01:2:48,130 01:2:46,420 --> 01:2:49,990 statistical knowledge that was actually 01:2:48,120 --> 01:2:49,990 01:2:48,130 --> 01:2:53,140 going to help him he received interest 01:2:49,980 --> 01:2:53,140 01:2:49,990 --> 01:2:54,940 from general managers in in in in 01:2:53,130 --> 01:2:54,940 01:2:53,140 --> 01:2:57,580 baseball he received interest from 01:2:54,930 --> 01:2:57,580 01:2:54,940 --> 01:2:59,560 people in other sports who were looking 01:2:57,570 --> 01:2:59,560 01:2:57,580 --> 01:3:2,770 at statistics from a different angle he 01:2:59,550 --> 01:3:2,770 01:2:59,560 --> 01:3:4,840 was receiving he was receiving interest 01:3:2,760 --> 01:3:4,840 01:3:2,770 --> 01:3:6,820 from people who worked in government who 01:3:4,830 --> 01:3:6,820 01:3:4,840 --> 01:3:8,500 were just really interested in how big 01:3:6,810 --> 01:3:8,500 01:3:6,820 --> 01:3:10,780 numbers added up maybe someone who 01:3:8,490 --> 01:3:10,780 01:3:8,500 --> 01:3:13,060 worked on American census data 01:3:10,770 --> 01:3:13,060 01:3:10,780 --> 01:3:16,090 he received interest from board lawyers 01:3:13,050 --> 01:3:16,090 01:3:13,060 --> 01:3:18,390 math Wizards all these kinds of people 01:3:16,080 --> 01:3:18,390 01:3:16,090 --> 01:3:20,800 who maybe weren't able to hold down jobs 01:3:18,380 --> 01:3:20,800 01:3:18,390 --> 01:3:21,280 but you know what all these people had 01:3:20,790 --> 01:3:21,280 01:3:20,800 --> 01:3:25,170 in mind 01:3:21,270 --> 01:3:25,170 01:3:21,280 --> 01:3:28,240 they were mailing Bill James their 01:3:25,160 --> 01:3:28,240 01:3:25,170 --> 01:3:30,730 criticisms their ideas their models and 01:3:28,230 --> 01:3:30,730 01:3:28,240 --> 01:3:33,190 their questions and soon Michael Lewis 01:3:30,720 --> 01:3:33,190 01:3:30,730 --> 01:3:35,920 writes that Bill James might have had 01:3:33,180 --> 01:3:35,920 01:3:33,190 --> 01:3:39,930 one of the strangest groups of people 01:3:35,910 --> 01:3:39,930 01:3:35,920 --> 01:3:44,770 ever assembled under one idea and it 01:3:39,920 --> 01:3:44,770 01:3:39,930 --> 01:3:48,400 reminds me of this quote from Zig Ziglar 01:3:44,760 --> 01:3:48,400 01:3:44,770 --> 01:3:51,520 what Bill James was able to do was kick 01:3:48,390 --> 01:3:51,520 01:3:48,400 --> 01:3:53,590 start this the statistics revolution in 01:3:51,510 --> 01:3:53,590 01:3:51,520 --> 01:3:55,450 baseball that led to Billy Beane in the 01:3:53,580 --> 01:3:55,450 01:3:53,590 --> 01:3:57,010 Oakland A's and now the Houston Astros 01:3:55,440 --> 01:3:57,010 01:3:55,450 --> 01:3:59,260 and all the cool things they're doing 01:3:57,000 --> 01:3:59,260 01:3:57,010 --> 01:4:2,140 within analytics it was this book from 01:3:59,250 --> 01:4:2,140 01:3:59,260 --> 01:4:5,410 1977 and reminds me of this quote from 01:4:2,130 --> 01:4:5,410 01:4:2,140 --> 01:4:8,140 Zig Ziglar who's a mentor of Seth Godin 01:4:5,400 --> 01:4:8,140 01:4:5,410 --> 01:4:11,200 the very famous marketer and author and 01:4:8,130 --> 01:4:11,200 01:4:8,140 --> 01:4:14,560 Zig Ziglar says don't become a wandering 01:4:11,190 --> 01:4:14,560 01:4:11,200 --> 01:4:18,370 generality be a meaningful specific and 01:4:14,550 --> 01:4:18,370 01:4:14,560 --> 01:4:19,960 I think he absolutely nails it so that's 01:4:18,360 --> 01:4:19,960 01:4:18,370 --> 01:4:21,730 where I want to talk about the paradox 01:4:19,950 --> 01:4:21,730 01:4:19,960 --> 01:4:24,640 of specificity I want to jump in real 01:4:21,720 --> 01:4:24,640 01:4:21,730 --> 01:4:26,470 quick go for like one example of this 01:4:24,630 --> 01:4:26,470 01:4:24,640 --> 01:4:27,579 was in when I was writing that that 01:4:26,460 --> 01:4:27,579 01:4:26,470 --> 01:4:29,739 failure essay 01:4:27,569 --> 01:4:29,739 01:4:27,579 --> 01:4:31,359 it was it was really tempting to say hey 01:4:29,729 --> 01:4:31,359 01:4:29,739 --> 01:4:32,979 how can I generalize this for more 01:4:31,349 --> 01:4:32,979 01:4:31,359 --> 01:4:34,479 people like what are the 15 lessons I 01:4:32,969 --> 01:4:34,479 01:4:32,979 --> 01:4:36,539 learned from you know starting this 01:4:34,469 --> 01:4:36,539 01:4:34,479 --> 01:4:38,859 company raising money blah blah blah and 01:4:36,529 --> 01:4:38,859 01:4:36,539 --> 01:4:39,880 as I got feedback from people it's 01:4:38,849 --> 01:4:39,880 01:4:38,859 --> 01:4:42,400 pretty clear like they're like I don't 01:4:39,870 --> 01:4:42,400 01:4:39,880 --> 01:4:44,109 care like I I just want your story like 01:4:42,390 --> 01:4:44,109 01:4:42,400 --> 01:4:46,660 what is your story actually don't don't 01:4:44,099 --> 01:4:46,660 01:4:44,109 --> 01:4:48,640 try to I don't make a single there's not 01:4:46,650 --> 01:4:48,640 01:4:46,660 --> 01:4:50,229 a single sentence of advice or like how 01:4:48,630 --> 01:4:50,229 01:4:48,640 --> 01:4:52,329 this is how you apply Blanche like I'm 01:4:50,219 --> 01:4:52,329 01:4:50,229 --> 01:4:55,569 just gonna tell you my story and I think 01:4:52,319 --> 01:4:55,569 01:4:52,329 --> 01:4:58,089 that's so key with why it worked and why 01:4:55,559 --> 01:4:58,089 01:4:55,569 --> 01:4:59,799 it actually had widespread widespread 01:4:58,079 --> 01:4:59,799 01:4:58,089 --> 01:5:1,539 sort of appeal I think it's exactly the 01:4:59,789 --> 01:5:1,539 01:4:59,799 --> 01:5:4,299 same point when I write fiction one of 01:5:1,529 --> 01:5:4,299 01:5:1,539 --> 01:5:6,880 my teachers said this is too vague like 01:5:4,289 --> 01:5:6,880 01:5:4,299 --> 01:5:9,819 I like one character his experience is 01:5:6,870 --> 01:5:9,819 01:5:6,880 --> 01:5:11,680 gonna be more relevant than like 30 you 01:5:9,809 --> 01:5:11,680 01:5:9,819 --> 01:5:14,529 know pick like everyone could relate 01:5:11,670 --> 01:5:14,529 01:5:11,680 --> 01:5:17,499 with pain but only if you write about 01:5:14,519 --> 01:5:17,499 01:5:14,529 --> 01:5:18,969 someone's pain you know if that makes 01:5:17,489 --> 01:5:18,969 01:5:17,499 --> 01:5:20,920 sense like everyone is an individual so 01:5:18,959 --> 01:5:20,920 01:5:18,969 --> 01:5:22,900 you should write about individuals don't 01:5:20,910 --> 01:5:22,900 01:5:20,920 --> 01:5:24,309 write it about generalities cuz know no 01:5:22,890 --> 01:5:24,309 01:5:22,900 --> 01:5:25,539 one's a generality you're not speaking 01:5:24,299 --> 01:5:25,539 01:5:24,309 --> 01:5:28,809 to generalities 01:5:25,529 --> 01:5:28,809 01:5:25,539 --> 01:5:32,849 you know yep absolutely 01:5:28,799 --> 01:5:32,849 01:5:28,809 --> 01:5:36,039 so I want to talk about wavelengths and 01:5:32,839 --> 01:5:36,039 01:5:32,849 --> 01:5:37,869 there are wavelengths well first let me 01:5:36,029 --> 01:5:37,869 01:5:36,039 --> 01:5:40,959 hold on let me just hop in and talk 01:5:37,859 --> 01:5:40,959 01:5:37,869 --> 01:5:43,359 about radios so when I was growing up I 01:5:40,949 --> 01:5:43,359 01:5:40,959 --> 01:5:49,059 grew up in San Francisco big baseball 01:5:43,349 --> 01:5:49,059 01:5:43,359 --> 01:5:51,249 fan and on 7:40 every morning AM 740 01:5:49,049 --> 01:5:51,249 01:5:49,059 --> 01:5:53,259 that was my dad's favorite channel and 01:5:51,239 --> 01:5:53,259 01:5:51,249 --> 01:5:55,719 that was the news channel where we'd get 01:5:53,249 --> 01:5:55,719 01:5:53,259 --> 01:5:58,269 in the car and at the top of the hour go 01:5:55,709 --> 01:5:58,269 01:5:55,719 --> 01:6:1,059 done and done and then and then they 01:5:58,259 --> 01:6:1,059 01:5:58,269 --> 01:6:2,559 would share the the news the 3-minute 01:6:1,049 --> 01:6:2,559 01:6:1,059 --> 01:6:5,049 news that's how my dad would get his 01:6:2,549 --> 01:6:5,049 01:6:2,559 --> 01:6:6,459 news every single morning and I was a 01:6:5,039 --> 01:6:6,459 01:6:5,049 --> 01:6:9,400 stubborn kid dad 01:6:6,449 --> 01:6:9,400 01:6:6,459 --> 01:6:11,559 I like a.m. 680 that's where my Giants 01:6:9,390 --> 01:6:11,559 01:6:9,400 --> 01:6:15,160 play that's where my warriors play I 01:6:11,549 --> 01:6:15,160 01:6:11,559 --> 01:6:17,829 would have taped the radio to make sure 01:6:15,150 --> 01:6:17,829 01:6:15,160 --> 01:6:20,469 that no other channel came on because 01:6:17,819 --> 01:6:20,469 01:6:17,829 --> 01:6:22,119 that was my channel and then when I was 01:6:20,459 --> 01:6:22,119 01:6:20,469 --> 01:6:24,999 with friends there was a channel called 01:6:22,109 --> 01:6:24,999 01:6:22,119 --> 01:6:27,430 wild 94 9 that played all the hip-hop 01:6:24,989 --> 01:6:27,430 01:6:24,999 --> 01:6:28,420 and pop music in San Francisco so that's 01:6:27,420 --> 01:6:28,420 01:6:27,430 --> 01:6:30,369 where we would hang out when we were 01:6:28,410 --> 01:6:30,369 01:6:28,420 --> 01:6:32,799 together and so how does radio work 01:6:30,359 --> 01:6:32,799 01:6:30,369 --> 01:6:35,680 right there are these things called 01:6:32,789 --> 01:6:35,680 01:6:32,799 --> 01:6:37,900 radio waves and we can't see radio waves 01:6:35,670 --> 01:6:37,900 01:6:35,680 --> 01:6:40,119 because we can only see a very small 01:6:37,890 --> 01:6:40,119 01:6:37,900 --> 01:6:40,960 fraction of the light spectrum called 01:6:40,109 --> 01:6:40,960 01:6:40,119 --> 01:6:45,400 visible light 01:6:40,950 --> 01:6:45,400 01:6:40,960 --> 01:6:47,619 and so radio waves are long wavelengths 01:6:45,390 --> 01:6:47,619 01:6:45,400 --> 01:6:49,150 that radio signals pick up and that's 01:6:47,609 --> 01:6:49,150 01:6:47,619 --> 01:6:51,550 how you can hear what's happening on the 01:6:49,140 --> 01:6:51,550 01:6:49,150 --> 01:6:54,369 radio and then they're shorter radio 01:6:51,540 --> 01:6:54,369 01:6:51,550 --> 01:6:56,740 waves like ultraviolet waves so what you 01:6:54,359 --> 01:6:56,740 01:6:54,369 --> 01:7:0,190 have is this is the whole spectrum of 01:6:56,730 --> 01:7:0,190 01:6:56,740 --> 01:7:3,070 light waves and we can only see visible 01:7:0,180 --> 01:7:3,070 01:7:0,190 --> 01:7:4,990 light and so what's happening on the 01:7:3,060 --> 01:7:4,990 01:7:3,070 --> 01:7:7,510 internet what is happening when you 01:7:4,980 --> 01:7:7,510 01:7:4,990 --> 01:7:9,670 curate a Twitter feed when you go and 01:7:7,500 --> 01:7:9,670 01:7:7,510 --> 01:7:11,560 you try to sign up for different sub 01:7:9,660 --> 01:7:11,560 01:7:9,670 --> 01:7:14,290 reddits what you're doing is you are 01:7:11,550 --> 01:7:14,290 01:7:11,560 --> 01:7:17,650 curating your own radio station and you 01:7:14,280 --> 01:7:17,650 01:7:14,290 --> 01:7:20,230 are finding your own radio wave and when 01:7:17,640 --> 01:7:20,230 01:7:17,650 --> 01:7:23,589 we talk about this word what resonates 01:7:20,220 --> 01:7:23,589 01:7:20,230 --> 01:7:25,690 right resonance is finding people on 01:7:23,579 --> 01:7:25,690 01:7:23,589 --> 01:7:28,930 your wavelength that's all you're doing 01:7:25,680 --> 01:7:28,930 01:7:25,690 --> 01:7:33,460 we're not trying to go find customers 01:7:28,920 --> 01:7:33,460 01:7:28,930 --> 01:7:35,740 we're trying to attract fans who just 01:7:33,450 --> 01:7:35,740 01:7:33,460 --> 01:7:36,700 happen to be on a radio wave and so what 01:7:35,730 --> 01:7:36,700 01:7:35,740 --> 01:7:38,290 we're doing is remember we're just 01:7:36,690 --> 01:7:38,290 01:7:36,700 --> 01:7:40,900 playing music right we're in a band 01:7:38,280 --> 01:7:40,900 01:7:38,290 --> 01:7:42,609 we're in a band and we're at Coachella 01:7:40,890 --> 01:7:42,609 01:7:40,900 --> 01:7:44,560 and there's all these different stages 01:7:42,599 --> 01:7:44,560 01:7:42,609 --> 01:7:47,050 and people are walking walking walking 01:7:44,550 --> 01:7:47,050 01:7:44,560 --> 01:7:49,540 and when they find our stage they stay 01:7:47,040 --> 01:7:49,540 01:7:47,050 --> 01:7:53,070 and they become fans but the question is 01:7:49,530 --> 01:7:53,070 01:7:49,540 --> 01:7:56,080 how do you create a radio station that 01:7:53,060 --> 01:7:56,080 01:7:53,070 --> 01:7:57,550 is the million dollar question so 01:7:56,070 --> 01:7:57,550 01:7:56,080 --> 01:7:59,859 there's a couple things that we want to 01:7:57,540 --> 01:7:59,859 01:7:57,550 --> 01:8:3,460 do the first thing that I recommend is 01:7:59,849 --> 01:8:3,460 01:7:59,859 --> 01:8:6,099 coining a term okay David that's so 01:8:3,450 --> 01:8:6,099 01:8:3,460 --> 01:8:9,119 helpful you're saying coin a term what 01:8:6,089 --> 01:8:9,119 01:8:6,099 --> 01:8:13,060 does that mean come on dude give me some 01:8:9,109 --> 01:8:13,060 01:8:9,119 --> 01:8:15,790 examples please people I got you so 01:8:13,050 --> 01:8:15,790 01:8:13,060 --> 01:8:16,750 these are two really good examples from 01:8:15,780 --> 01:8:16,750 01:8:15,790 --> 01:8:18,850 big companies 01:8:16,740 --> 01:8:18,850 01:8:16,750 --> 01:8:22,480 the first is HubSpot the second is a 01:8:18,840 --> 01:8:22,480 01:8:18,850 --> 01:8:24,520 company called IDEO and HubSpot came up 01:8:22,470 --> 01:8:24,520 01:8:22,480 --> 01:8:28,089 with this idea called inbound marketing 01:8:24,510 --> 01:8:28,089 01:8:24,520 --> 01:8:30,250 and until HubSpot all these people just 01:8:28,079 --> 01:8:30,250 01:8:28,089 --> 01:8:31,989 talked about marketing but it turned out 01:8:30,240 --> 01:8:31,989 01:8:30,250 --> 01:8:33,580 that there was outbound marketing and 01:8:31,979 --> 01:8:33,580 01:8:31,989 --> 01:8:34,719 they came up with this framework where 01:8:33,570 --> 01:8:34,719 01:8:33,580 --> 01:8:36,940 you'd go and you'd actually reach 01:8:34,709 --> 01:8:36,940 01:8:34,719 --> 01:8:38,920 customers and then there's inbound 01:8:36,930 --> 01:8:38,920 01:8:36,940 --> 01:8:41,469 marketing where you have a methodology 01:8:38,910 --> 01:8:41,469 01:8:38,920 --> 01:8:43,839 and other people come to you and that's 01:8:41,459 --> 01:8:43,839 01:8:41,469 --> 01:8:46,630 exactly what we're trying to do and then 01:8:43,829 --> 01:8:46,630 01:8:43,839 --> 01:8:49,120 there's I do when somebody thinks of 01:8:46,620 --> 01:8:49,120 01:8:46,630 --> 01:8:51,609 design thinking they think of this 01:8:49,110 --> 01:8:51,609 01:8:49,120 --> 01:8:54,820 company called IDEO almost no matter 01:8:51,599 --> 01:8:54,820 01:8:51,609 --> 01:8:57,280 what they have what's called a personal 01:8:54,810 --> 01:8:57,280 01:8:54,820 --> 01:8:59,050 manopoly both of these companies have 01:8:57,270 --> 01:8:59,050 01:8:57,280 --> 01:9:2,110 what I call a personal monopoly on 01:8:59,040 --> 01:9:2,110 01:8:59,050 --> 01:9:4,450 inbound marketing and design thinking 01:9:2,100 --> 01:9:4,450 01:9:2,110 --> 01:9:6,370 they have coined those terms so what are 01:9:4,440 --> 01:9:6,370 01:9:4,450 --> 01:9:8,110 the benefits of Corning terms well when 01:9:6,360 --> 01:9:8,110 01:9:6,370 --> 01:9:11,950 it comes to search engine optimization 01:9:8,100 --> 01:9:11,950 01:9:8,110 --> 01:9:14,050 no competition then when it comes to if 01:9:11,940 --> 01:9:14,050 01:9:11,950 --> 01:9:15,880 you study some really good strategists 01:9:14,040 --> 01:9:15,880 01:9:14,050 --> 01:9:20,620 you know what they'll say to you they'll 01:9:15,870 --> 01:9:20,620 01:9:15,880 --> 01:9:24,370 say don't try to move the pieces on the 01:9:20,610 --> 01:9:24,370 01:9:20,620 --> 01:9:28,210 board and be the best at that you want 01:9:24,360 --> 01:9:28,210 01:9:24,370 --> 01:9:30,820 to actually create the board itself that 01:9:28,200 --> 01:9:30,820 01:9:28,210 --> 01:9:33,220 is the kind of 3d chess that you're 01:9:30,810 --> 01:9:33,220 01:9:30,820 --> 01:9:35,980 doing when you're coining terms you are 01:9:33,210 --> 01:9:35,980 01:9:33,220 --> 01:9:37,870 actually shaping how people are thinking 01:9:35,970 --> 01:9:37,870 01:9:35,980 --> 01:9:41,140 about your industry and that is the 01:9:37,860 --> 01:9:41,140 01:9:37,870 --> 01:9:43,480 highest leverage place to be so what are 01:9:41,130 --> 01:9:43,480 01:9:41,140 --> 01:9:45,910 some examples of this well I talked 01:9:43,470 --> 01:9:45,910 01:9:43,480 --> 01:9:47,950 about the personal monopoly so this is 01:9:45,900 --> 01:9:47,950 01:9:45,910 --> 01:9:50,230 my term that I coined that we talk about 01:9:47,940 --> 01:9:50,230 01:9:47,950 --> 01:9:51,640 all the time and write a passage and I 01:9:50,220 --> 01:9:51,640 01:9:50,230 --> 01:9:53,370 said that this secret to internet 01:9:51,630 --> 01:9:53,370 01:9:51,640 --> 01:9:55,750 marketing is to be known for something 01:9:53,360 --> 01:9:55,750 01:9:53,370 --> 01:9:57,250 mary meeker the famous venture 01:9:55,740 --> 01:9:57,250 01:9:55,750 --> 01:10:0,400 capitalist with an internet trends 01:9:57,240 --> 01:10:0,400 01:9:57,250 --> 01:10:2,620 report there's an acquired FM podcast which I highly recommend that tells the story of all these cool acquisitions in Silicon Valley with Disney with with with Facebook Instagram then there is my friend Webb Smith he has this newsletter called 2 p.m. and he's built our whole business around that newsletter 2 p.m. comes around I think of Webb he made it his thing all of them use it to actually teach their industry and through it they've all built personal monopolies so the question is when do you know that you're doing this right and I'll show you when people on other parts of the internet start using your terminology you can see Michael Dave and an anonymous person on Twitter actually promoting my own ideas using it as part of their language that is what it means to create the actual board and to coin terms so what I want to do is I want to share who are some of these what I'm going to call from now on wavelength warriors who are our wavelength warriors it just so happens we have two of them here right now the first is Sahil look at what he's doing his pin tweet is actually him saying look I'm gonna share my Q&A this is what we are doing as an organization where we're going how we're thinking about things where we're struggling memberships impact of coronavirus on the Creator economy how we think about what to work on and he's saying if you're interested in this step into our orbit Sahil is there anything you want to add to this um no I think you nailed it I think if I were to pick a term that I'm trying to coin open board meeting is a good one yeah so that's a very good one example absolutely and then Anna what she's doing on ax you want to present on how you're thinking about about this tweet and how this tweet frames all the work that we're doing together yeah yeah absolutely um so can you all hear me yep okay I'm a former elementary school teacher and I could discontent with the system and with the way things were going into school and my inability to transcend it and I started to question everything everything and and then this this particular tweet is just kind of like the basics of something that we all know we've all been through this we can all relate to this topic through some form of schooling and and it was just a provocative way to get people to think about the things that are already in their mind but sometimes they need to read it this way in order to realize that this is going on and then really if anyone goes in my profile and once you know the things that I'm talking about or what I'm thinking or what's driving my mission this tweet really summarizes that it's kind of like the you know my confusion and where I'm working from so yeah that's the one that I have up there and that resonated with a lot of people and as you can see seventeen thousand likes so what has happened from this tweet is on and I if we've launched our summer camp we have all these teachers and educators from around the world no hyperbole all over the place reaching out to us saying how can I help how can I get my kids in summer camp because they have been looking looking looking standing the radio changing station boom they found Ana's Channel and now they're saying I want my kids to be a part of this I want to get involved and if we ever need to hire or anything like that this is super helpful for us and then likewise what I do is I frame rite of passage as a big alternative to traditional writing education and rite of passage isn't just a writing school it is a place to become what I call a citizen of the internet and I frame what real life is against school in that some of the things that school gets wrong in school we learn in private we follow the syllabus we write for the teacher you spend who you spend fifteen years in school you write for one person your teachers in real life and rite of passage you learn in public you follow your curiosity and you get to write for a global audience and then you see this all over the place people like carnivore Aurelius it is an anonymous account that I don't even you know who knows who's behind this but they're coming out there Pro a heavy meat diet they're saying meat is bad for you the Sun is bad few fasting is bad for you it's like a revolt against the modern world and you might say you know what eating meat is bad I disagree that that that fasting is bad for you I actually think that that's really I actually agree that fasting is bad for you or you could say whoa they are speaking to me right now this is exactly what I believe and you get right on their wavelength their goal isn't to get every single customer in the world their goal is to find the right people then there's David at Basecamp co-founder Basecamp and they are always going against venture capital they're always going they they they have a way of building things a way of operating internally a code of ethics that they are loud about and they have attracted a series of not just customers but fans of the business and then there's barstool sports you might hate barstool you might love barstool but all of you have an opinion on barstool after 2 minutes of scrolling that feed that is what barstool is doing they're trying to say we want people to either love us or hate us and we don't want anyone in the middle that is finding the wavelength so it gets back into the paradox of specificity on the Internet the narrower your brand the more opportunities come to you the internet is the best matching tool ever invented so pick a niche learn all about it and share what you learn by writing online then you'll watch your life improve and once again you begin to see other people actually writing about your ideas and check this out yeah go for it really quick I think a lot of folks they look at some of these examples of folks who found a lot of success on the Internet and they think that it's because they're appealing to generalities and like if you and and that's just because you don't see the through line you think that it they're writing about everything but then you realize like if you look at my feet I basically say the same thing over and over again you know you just don't notice it because you're not in my head but I'm basically saying everyone should start a business and I basically motivate people to start businesses that's like if you look at every single thing that I tweet you'll probably see that through mine involve same thing like people think oh and a bully tweets about all these things no he doesn't hate tweets about one thing I'll let people figure that one out some mystery so though so we have the paradox of specificity and then we have Joe wells actually writing about this idea and guess what the idea about Bill James and Moneyball that I talked about earlier I never read the book I got that idea from Joe's article cuz Joe is doing the work for me so now what I have is I put out these ideas about writing into the world and all these people from around the world take my idea they begin to spin off of it and they begin to add for add to it and then what you find is you begin to find your beats your drum beats and then you begin to find other bands who you want to make remixes with other bands who are playing on that same genre as you and what you see is right here build for everyone and you build for no one build for one person and you build for thousands from Sahil he had no idea that I was thinking about this but then I can take that idea and I can start adding it so what we're doing here just to recap what we're trying to do is we're trying to build a band basically we're trying to teach to have an insolvent and remember you have all these different instruments at your disposal you have tweets you have essays podcasts emails and workshops just like this one and as you teach you'll attract all these like-minded people with every single new note that you put down ding-ding-ding-ding-ding you'll attract employees customers clients partners media coverage you name it and they won't just be customers they'll be fans and what will happen is they will come together you'll build this tribe of people you'll forget about the rest of the world you'll have your people these like-minded people this community a real community of all these people who share similar beliefs and over time you'll end up building that painting out of a series of small little brush strokes there we go everybody thank you awesome so let's do a little QA so for all of you it looks like we had one person right in the QA already and if you would like to add questions please do so and we'll we'll monitor that and we'll go for 10 or 15 minutes so so your first question for you is how are your company documents organized and then what mechanism do your employees use to find any arbitrary document and we'll I'll let you take it from here on out yeah so we use notion so everything is a notion we just have a sting document called the wiki and it's just list of like 10 different 10 or 15 different documents you'd be surprised at how little you need I think that's a big thing the best edit you can make is deletion right so like simplify you're actually operating procedures and then you just need less stuff to document people will get last stock you know you'll just need to explain less things I mean you think about like McDonald's like that's an incredibly simple menu you don't need a lot of stuff why because guess what every time McDonald's introduces a new item like I don't know tens of millions of people have to now learn about this new thing and that's just people you know how assembling the thing like supply chains like just so much complexity so yeah it's really it's really simple it could be a Google Doc it really doesn't need to be any any more complex than a single document if it's more complex than that it's it's you either run a massive company gummer you know we're pretty big with you or about 10 million in annual revenue so it's not small anymore 15 20 employees but you know just one one document you know with some with some stuff headers and things like that yeah any advice on how to get over being scared and nervous to publish your ideas for other people to read no I mean you just do it I think it's like it's like the good how do I get motivated question it's like you just realize that like no one cares if you're motivated or not like no one's gonna convince you you know no one like you know navall says save yourself basically I kind of agree with that like it's just it's your responsibility it's your responsibility to get healthy to get wealthy to get whatever whatever you want like the only person that can guarantee that for you is yourself really and so yeah just do it I mean I don't know publish publish it to one person like send it to somebody the truth is no one cares like if it's bad no one cares like people people pull your stuff all the time and you never hear about like the good stuff is the stuff that sticks in my opinion all the failures like I've built plenty of things I've written plenty of terrible things like I asked people like what's the worst thing you read last week like what is the absolute worst thing I can you name one thing I can personally okay if you can like who wrote it like can tell me that right so like I honestly think it's a it's like an ego issue like you actually think people care more than they do about you and your work they know so being being scared is just an ego problem well what should we what's the best question in the chat um a whole bunch of different ones one I have mine just if somebody is a CEO of young company you'd give a rule of thumb but a percentage of time amount of time they should dedicate to writing as opposed to everything else but how much of a focus be if you're trying to grow a young company yeah that's a good question I mean I think it I think it depends but I don't know I spent 40 50 hours writing that piece it it takes time so I would say just understand that like don't I think the problem with the way with thinking about it like it's X percent or X hours a week is is is you're saying like I need to write a 50,000 word book or at three thousand word essay which is not really the right way to think about it you should write as much as it benefits your whatever you're trying to do you know and so if you're really trying to understand a topic it might take hundreds and hundreds of hours to understand that topic unlikely that time is the constraint though right like everyone has tons of time unless you have a bunch of kids and I like course exceptions apply but in general like it's like if you're if I use the example of Game of Thrones like people would be like I don't have time for blank I'm like did you watch Game of Thrones like yeah it was amazing I'm like well that's like 40 hours per season or something 20 hours per season like don't watch it watch it next year I don't know but yeah it's you know and the other the other thing I'd say just like start simpler like don't think of if it's if it's really like if you're tweeting like just tweet just you know like do it on the toilet like you can find the time for it and you can start don't wait until you have a certain amount of time to start just start as early as you can in might be perfect I've got three or four questions all about which platforms should you use to share your ideas and your writing in particular David now you know you love with this one people are asking about medium so maybe just talk about how to start building an audience and what platform to be using yeah so first of all I've I'm going to answer the meta question and then I'm going to answer the real question if this is the place stocke you should not be stuck here this is one of those questions that seems important that actually is not important at all and you should make this decision and then go on to the next thing as fast as possible the idea that your success as a writer will hinge on what platform you're using I don't know where this comes from but a lot of people really believe it and it's the furthest thing from the truth with that said now I'll answer the question I recommend writing on are you Squarespace you could use Wix I recommend some kind of website that you actually own with a domain name that you actually own with the website that's actually yours and then you could have a newsletter on sub stack one thing though that I think way too many people are doing is they're prioritizing their sub stacks in expense of their long-form evergreen writing prioritize the long-form stuff so that people can continue to read that so that you have an incentive to write amazing essays there I mean look what Sahil did with his single essay you could read that essay 15 years from now and it will still be relevant that's the kind of stuff that you want to be focused on and then I do not recommend medium I know that we have Sahil who wrote his essay on medium but I see that they're now actually dropping in different notes into his content which I mean we could talk about that but it really goes to show that medium owns that not him and you want to have a website we're capturing email addresses guys I'll tell you I've been capturing email addresses for two years now I have more than 20,000 people who I can email at any moment because of that because I've captured email because I've had my own site where I can easily have this funnel I now have the ability to work on summer camp with ahna and know that we can find 25 people without a single cent of paid marketing my email list is the single most most valuable asset I own when I buy a house it'll likely be more valuable than my house when I buy a car it will definitely be more valuable to my car it is more valuable than all my stuff my point is do not worry about what product or platform you're gonna use except you should use Gumroad wink wink and then what you should do gotcha and then what you should do is then just write on your own website with your own domain name and build your email list yeah I will not be using medium anymore I'm gonna move my articles out there probably next couple weeks yeah I just do it on your own website so much yeah so much better question for Sahil from Kevin you write with brevity on Twitter each tweet has a lot of meaning why have you chosen not to expand on certain tweets in longer form writing again such as via a personal website maybe people will realize there's not that much there now I don't know I mean I think again like I write like my audience is smart and busy and I I kind of believe I really believe that in the sense that like if I expand it on it like like 1% of those people that retweeted it or read that initial tweet would actually it would actually read the longer form thing and I think so that's the busy part and they have yes the smart part is like I kind of want people to go on that journey I think the beautiful thing about that painting that a David showed pointer wasn't painting is it it completes in your head you know such as simple if you really look I mean it's not there's not a lot there but it's it feels like you're somewhere you know so much is going on in your head and that's kind of how I think my tweet so I kind of want to see like start a conversation but then it's up to you to finish it it's up to you to go explore that idea spend hours if you want thinking about it and and and then also I just kind of like the mystique of it like I kind of like the idea that like there are these simple things that I'm thinking about or these complex things I'm thinking about like here's like a snapshot every so often the other problem I think is just like the minute you start you know it's kind of like give an inch people want a foot right like I've tried to expand sometimes and then it just becomes a conversation I honestly just think Twitter is not a great format often for conversations it's really good for broadcasting but that's not about a yeah maybe maybe my email newsletter that will be what I focus on us at some point I will have to start writing that involve talks about being a little mysterious with what you tweet always thought that wasn't interesting he certainly does that next question a couple of people asked this how do you know what to play how do you choose your music you just start playing any content or any suggestions on people just starting out where to start yeah I'll take this so look you should write about what you're excited about I mean really like when you paint when you create anything you have this vague vision of what it should be so often you'll have like a one-line thesis or you'll say you know what I have this hunch that this sort of thing is interesting and then you're just gonna paint your first brushstroke you're gonna go here you're gonna sort of paint next to it and you'll go on these really interesting intellectual tangents as you build your business so you'll start painting in the foreground on the bottom left then you'll get to the background on the top right and that's why I like the brushstroke metaphor you're not building you're not painting an entire painting at once you're just putting one brushstroke in focus on one very small part of your intellectual tapestry right like what is the cliche rome wasn't built in the in a day and brick by brick you end up building the Coliseum and that's what you're trying to do here so I wouldn't think oh I'm gonna have a 50-point content plan yeah if you're Microsoft then that helps but you're just a single person and right now you're excited about an idea and don't over direct where that's gonna go if something fires you up if something makes your blood boil something energizes you to put words on the page write that yeah fully agree yeah that's exactly what I would say it's just start that's the other thing I think I worry that some people that ask this question are like looking are just like not starting like not playing an instrument and it really no one's gonna hold you to it no one's gonna come back a month for now be like hey you said you were gonna you were playing a trumpet now you're playing piano I don't wanna just start just just it really doesn't matter and playing that instrument is gonna get you to where you want to go anyways you're you're not you're unlikely to pick the right answer but the way you get to the right answer is by a few wrong answers that get closer over time you know so this next question dovetails off of that but what how do you write if you're not an expert in something is it okay to be learning in public or do you you know so if people have this thought that they need to be an expert before they start any any thoughts there yeah my friend my friend Gary was talking about this last week and I think he absolutely nailed it expertise is like a ladder where every single time that you learn something you just climb one step up the ladder and we're actually all climbing these ladders and once you're about three steps up there's all these people below you and there's all these people above you and you're looking at all the people above and you're saying that oh my goodness you're an expert and all the people below you are looking at you saying wow this person is somebody who I can learn from and the problem with expertise societally is we think of it in a very binary fashion you're either an expert or you know nothing and the truth is that's not the case at all all of us know certain things all of us underestimate how many things we know that other people would benefit from learning about and we are all climbing up the ladder and so if you have done anything if you have read a book if you have gone to a movie if you have walked around the city then you are further up on a ladder and you should start sharing so that you can help all the people below you so stop thinking about expertise as this thing where you're an expert or you're not because it's not the case at all and that belief is limiting you and holding you back I saw you you said you have a bias toward strong writing skills at Gumroad how do you hire an interview for it do you require people to apply with writing samples do you just read their personal blogs and tweets how do you go about that yeah I think if they have content out there I read it almost everyone has a Twitter I also think you you just get a sense like again like writing is everywhere like they email me you know asking for if I have a job or you know for the to apply and you know like you can you can get a very clear sense very quickly about someone's someone's writing skills all right we have a coding challenge so the way that they frame that the questions that they ask about it if they have any um even the way they read the code writing code is is bright right and so you can learn a lot about someone's ability to think through a problem solve a problem just by how they solve the problem and the writing is sort of become self evident pretty quickly for sure perfect had two questions on this so do you recommend breaking down complex topics to not lose less informed audiences or do you just assume the audience can figure it out lady are you really strategic about what level of the ladder you're writing for or you just sort of say what you want to say yeah I think say what you want to say I think you're gonna miss I think if you if you aim at a very specific target you're gonna miss it's just better to write write write like write to understand what you're writing about and then the people that are at that level will you know like well sort of appreciate it the people that aren't won't write I think I learned this with with painting as I started painting where like a teacher could teach and there's things that I thought I understood and then a year later I was like oh that's what they really meant and then like a year later oh that's actually what's you really meant and I'm sure there are so many layers and levels to like everything that I read that is filtered through my own experience and and you have to be like at the right moment to get the right thing anyway is that it's just impossible I think for a teacher to be like I can teach you know it just doesn't it doesn't work so I think you should just write right just to understand that the idea that's the primary thing yeah everything I think it comes yeah I I just want to question the premise of that question so many of the misconceptions that come with online writing come from a model of I'm gonna go find my customers as if it's a very active process this is an extremely passive process you literally write and you write whatever is gonna help you think better whatever is gonna help you enjoy writing and you just put it out there so that you can understand your thinking better or anything like that like it really doesn't matter that much but what ends up happening is you actually attract people they come to you you don't go to them you literally you sit there you're on the toilet you write a tweet and then people slide into your DMS like it is it is as simple and as funny as that because that's exactly how it happens and it isn't this like outbound sales model if I'm gonna go cold email 764 different people begging them to read my writing I just put stuff out and people come back and magic happens so for me one thing that I fully agree with Sahil on is you want it I want to write people who for people who are smart and for people who are busy because I want people who are smart and busy in my life and so what I just try to do is I try to write for the smartest damn people in the world so that those people become my friends that's always been my goal writing so that's what I do but they will come to you yeah and it would take time I think some people I think that question often comes from a place of impatience or like fear that they won't and so you want them to come as soon as possible to prove that they will eventually come but you know it's yeah I think every every interesting all the interesting stuff that happens to you you can't make happen for yourself by definition right hit like that's why they're interesting it's because people sort of Knight you with these experiences like you have a meeting with someone that you couldn't have dreamed you you would never have been able to meet with them because their guard would be up there you'd be one email in an inbox of 10,000 but if they read something you say and ldm you and be like hey I like this article and you can say hey cool I'm in San Francisco next week you want to grab dinner ninety-nine percent of the time it's gonna be yes why because they reached out to you you're probably not gonna murder them right and so and that's really the filter for a lot of people are you be one of the five percent of people that are gonna be really weird or like uncomfortable for me to me in person that's why people don't that's the filter so if you can get about that which you definitely can if you could write succinctly and and you'll be surprised I think it does take time but you will be surprised in my opinion you'll be incredibly surprised with how many and the caliber of people will start to reach out to you when you put yourself out there and your ideas of it yeah Anna can you in like 30 seconds maybe a minute just tell the story of how you found rite of passage and then how we ended up teaming up on summer camp I mean I didn't even know you six months ago and actually the way that we became partners is a perfect manifestation of everything that we're saying here yeah yeah so it's interesting because it was actually my husband the one that it was a big fan and he would follow your work and he liked the way that you would express the different ideas in writing and he was like Anna you should really follow this guy whose name's David he talks in a way that will catch your attention and I did I started following you and I really like the way that you write and then the way that you would communicate your thoughts about education too so I enrolled in write a passage and I came in thinking that I was just gonna learn how to write in a different way and kind of like unlearn the way that I've been teaching my students how to write so it's kind of like excited about that and then I discovered this whole world of online learning and how you know writing for clarity and writing for a different purpose and and then just you know through that I kind of got to talk to you and we started sharing different thoughts about education and and we realized that we had this same interest and what really surprised me was that the class really just got me to meet and through writing and sharing my writing which is something that I used to not do I'm starting to meet a lot of people that were like you said in my same Symphony and and people that shared the same interests and we started connecting and that's you know you were one of those people but now it got to the point where a bunch of my friends and the people that I'm talking on a day-to-day basis all came from people who are attracted to me through my writing so so yeah and then we ended up you know we are creating this course and we're trying to replicate something like this for kids and it works really well so yeah well let's do one more question thank you Anna this is a different kind of question who are you writing role models and y-yeah so I'll go first I so I have a couple I mean I would just want to distinguish between different kinds of writing the kind of writing that I'm gonna answer this question to is online writing so like there's Gregory David Roberts who wrote a book called Shantaram that is masterfully written but I don't want to write like him on the internet for me I think that the people who I admire are a guy named Eugene way and Scott Galloway and Morgan Housel I think that they are a really good trio of writers I admire Eugene's ability to be very observational and to see things that I had seen like as if things that everyone is so familiar with that nobody actually sees it's a very weird paradox that I think a lot of good writers pick up on and Eugene is very good at that with Morgan Morgan is really good at he he has no friction in his writing so if you you actually forget that you're reading so with the clarity of his prose the ideas go straight from his brain into yours and it's so easiest so just calm reading his stuff and then Scott Galloway just has this splash of energy just so much excitement and I read his stuff and I just have fun and that kind of combination between sharp observation extreme clarity and giving my readers a sense of fun and enjoyment is what I try to do so the three of them are on my riding Hall of Fame and I try to emulate them as much as I can yeah for me online writing specifically I think like the guy behind xkcd is a phenomenal writer Paul Graham is a classic but his essays are great and he has a ton of them I would say like the ball is a great writer as well Venkatesh Rao he he wrote this amazing I don't know if it's called a book um call breaking smart I think it's available for free and it was so good so good it's so good good is a legend because he you he is he is so he doesn't he it's hard to describe he's weird he's a weird dude who's very okay with just being weird and and but he's he's a I think it comes from a place of confidence because he knows how house my intelligence he is he's he's a he's definitely probably maybe the one Morgan Housel amazing as well of course oh Michael Moritz I would say he's probably um maybe not as known for his writing but Mike Moritz is a phenomenal writer and a VC so yeah yeah um I just want to give all of you a strong book recommendation for breaking smart it is for me one of the single most impactful books in terms of how I think about the world and I would frame many of the things that I'm doing and I know as an organization Venkatesh Rao between me and will and then my business partner Thiago who runs a course called building a second brain we are very influenced by vet Venkatesh Rao and all of you should read that book it is ten years ahead of its time it's fantastic well so you know thank you very much for your time today all of you thank you for showing up I I appreciate it and and and we'll see you in other parts of the internet you can follow me on twitter you can follow heal on twitter check out our writing and say any closing words no I was it was super fun super super happy to do it great thank you everybody have a great evening take care see you later
