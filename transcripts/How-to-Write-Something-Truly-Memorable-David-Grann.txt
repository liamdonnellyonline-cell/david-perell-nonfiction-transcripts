David Gran, one of the best storytellers alive today and an absolute master at narrative non-fiction. You might know him from Killer to the Flower Moon, which Martin Scorsesi turned into a film. And then there's The Wager. I can't think of a single book that more people I know have said that they just read [music] the entire thing from start to finish in one sitting. So, what is it that he does to find stories, to research them, to turn them into writing that just makes people flip from page to page? Lush, vivid pros, great descriptions. How does he do it? Well, that's what this conversation's all about. Okay, let me show you this new tool that I've been using to write called Sublime. And they're the sponsor of this episode. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how I use Sublime to [music] write this post on X, which got almost a million impressions. So, it started off with the basic note-taking stuff. I was just throwing notes in, but it's the stuff that came after that was really unique. [music] That's what makes Sublime special. You'll see here that I had this mind map and that allowed me to begin to see connections that weren't even there. And I was blown away by this. And then it didn't just end there. Sublime has this save one discover 100 feature where you can just put in a piece of information and all of a sudden it just starts recommending things. It's like having a research assistant that actually has good taste. And these are put in there by actual human beings. And so now I had the mind map. I had all the related ideas and I really started to think about how am I actually going to structure this piece [music] and Sublime helped me see parts of my structure that I didn't even realize were there to see how ideas were actually connected. See, Sublime is built by people who care about creativity and beauty and not just productivity and efficiency. And you can feel that as you use the app. So, if you want to use Sublime in your own writing, well, you can go to sublime.app and use the promo code PL [music] and they'll give you 20% off. All right, let's get to the episode. >> Well, I want to start with this cuz this is crazy. You said, "I've linked two new cases to a murderer that were not previously connected, and I've identified a killer who had not been identified before just through documents, finding files, and piecing together a circumstantial case." What? Yeah. Uh well, in Killers of the Flower Moon, when I was researching that book, uh I discovered that there were many cases that had never been properly investigated by the authorities and that there were these other killings. and going through the records and finding secret grand jury testimony and various bits, I began to realize that the evidence circumstantially all pointed to this figure who had not been previously identified and worse than that had had never been charged and had gotten away with it, which was one of the great horrors when I was working on that story of Killers of the Flower Moon that there were these perpetrators uh that had gone uh unpunished. Wow. And what do you think accounts for that? Like how could it be that the intelligence agencies aren't finding things? >> Well, at that time, um, this was taking place in the early parts of the 20th century when these killings were taking place. >> Uh, there was a great deal of corruption and local law enforcement and poor training. It was very easy for the powerful to tilt the scales of justice to pace somebody off. And as it turned out with these killings which was basically the systematic targeting of members of the Oage nation for their oil money um because of the corruption because of prejudice uh a lot of people got away with this. Yeah. So how does that research process work? You just look and you're scanning. You're looking and you're scanning. There's been a few what I guess I'm going to call breakthrough moments that I want to get to. It seems like there's kind of these moments when you're >> gazing around. and you're like, I'm going to do a story about this and then boom, you find something. >> Yes. I mean, when you're doing research, there is uh there is a a level of serendipity about it and a and a level of tedium that that shouldn't go unmentioned. I mean, a lot of research is staring at documents weeks and weeks and weeks and then suddenly you open a folder, it may not even be properly marked or indexed in the records. One of the things that was so helpful for me in Killers of the Flower Moon and piecing together evidence was in a folder I had seen somebody just somebody had cleaned out their office probably back in the 30s or the ' 40s, 1930s or 40s and just dropped in the secret grand jury testimony. That evidence should not have been in a public archive, but it was just sitting there unmarked, kind of scattered. Uh, and it was hugely helpful to me in piecing together some of these cases that were never properly charged. And you must just have crazy patience, huh? I I I feel like I could never do that. >> Well, I always I always joke that the really the only difference between being a writer and a non-writer is the writer is just willing to basically sit for hours and hours either fixing one sentence or looking through endless boxes. Endless boxes. You know, it was amazing for Killers of the Flower Moon. One of the major sources of research was a branch of the National Archives which is in Fort Worth, Texas, not far from where where you were back. Yeah. And uh it's about the size of an airport hanger and you could fit in a few airplanes in there. Um and you would pull these boxes. Uh you get in there early in the morning and out would these box but you could spend you know you could spend a lifetime going through those boxes. So, if I was like, man, Killers of the Flower Moon, The Wager, such a such a good book, like how much of that being a great book comes down to research, like, dude, I just did the work to find the information to dig up, uncover the story versus like I sat down at my keyboard and I just wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote. Well, I there's there's probably uh a convergence of the two, but I will say if you're writing non-fiction, if you are not a fiction writer, a great book can't exist without the first. It just it can't exist. So the underlying research, the details you extract from the research, what lets you create scenes, what lets you get as close to the people you're writing about to have emotion from their diaries or their letters or their correspondent. So they are interconnected if you can't then kind of convey them in words and create scenes around them. But you could not do it without the first. So the first is is foundational and I think sometimes people forget I mean, I will have an outline for a chapter, a single chapter in a book that may be only a 3,000word chapter. I I may have a 200page outline of information that I have absorbed from all the records and all the documents that will allow me to reconstruct something um faithfully but also vividly. >> Whoa. So, what is that outline like? >> Oh, it's just massive. So, you know, for example, let's say you're meeting someone. So you you know in that chapter you'd have their all the biographical details, every little physical detail about them. Did they walk with a limp? What color are their eyes? Um anything they said, what's their manner of diction? Do you have any quotes from them that reveals how they speak? Let's say you're building an opening scene or around them. Well, who are all the various participants that describe what happened in that moment? you know, the different perspectives, every little fragment, every letter. Let's say it took place in a restaurant. Do you have any description of the restaurant? Do you have a photograph of the restaurant? What will allow you to piece it together? So, you're looking at, you know, we're sitting here looking at each other. So, we've seen it, right? So, we see it. I know what you look like. I know you're sweating. So, right. Exactly. So, but what if I, you know, I know what the color of the rug is. But, but for most of the stuff I write about, especially when I'm doing historical work, >> I I wasn't there. Some of this stuff took place 300 years ago. So who described it? Where can I find that? I I have come across stories to answer your question kind of in a almost in a more kind of crisp way. I've come across some wonderful stories I would like to tell, but then I do some research and I can't find any records to tell it. And those are stories that unfortunately can never be told. >> Okay. So, I'm trying to just imagine this where you're early on in a book, maybe you just finished a previous one, now you're looking for a new idea. Sure. And you're kind of scanning, you're browsing. >> And talk to me about what are the conditions that you need to be like, "Yes, I'm going to do this." >> Well, I will say, um, whenever I finish a a project, I'm I'm exhausted. Some of these projects have taken me years and years, half a decade, sometimes more. And I sometimes find myself just sitting in my office, sitting in a chair, not unlike this one, just kind of looking around going, "Okay, what's next? What's going to be next?" And you keep waiting for that divine inspiration. It will never come. I mean, if you, you know, it is not a passive process. So after using a few weeks of that going, "Okay, and and then you get terrified. You're like, okay, I'll never find another idea. I'll never find another project." You start to kind of frantically look around and and you do various things to do that. Um, I call random people. I call people I may have read a newspaper story where I saw somebody did a had a profession or was a scientist had a breakthrough and I oh that's really interesting. I'll randomly see if I could track down that person and call them to pick their brain. And sometimes they're like you know I'm trying to save humanity right now. I have no time for your your your your little book. Yeah. For your little book your intrusion. Who the hell are you? And then every once like oh wow that sounds like so much fun. Let's chat. and you have these random conversations and maybe something will come out of that or you start looking at books or subject matters that interest you. Um maybe you look at footnotes. So for example, the wager uh my most recent book I was sitting around and I was thinking oh well you know what would be interesting. I thought well a subject that's always interested me was mutinies. I was like mutinies are just a very interesting form of rebellion. And so I started reading books about mutinies and going online and searching and suddenly I ended up in a British archive that had online a digital scan of a journal from the 18th century. It was written by uh John Byron who had been a 16-year-old midshipman on the wager. I had never heard of him. I started reading this little booklet. It was written in very old English, so it had the uh the S's were Fs. And at first, I was like, "Oh, what is this? This is hard to read. It was kind of faded." But then every once in a while, I would come across these remarkable descriptions. I mean, we're talking about writing, right? So, I'm reading this journal and I would come across a passage. He described the the the storm around Cape Horn. He said, "The perfect hurricane." I think that's such a modern uh kind of phrase, the perfect storm. The perfect hurricane. He started describing the scurvy and how it got inside people's bodies. Oh, this is kind of interesting. By the time I finished, I thought this is got the hints and the clues to one of the most extraordinary sagas I'd ever come across. So, that was the kind of the the flicker that was the the inspiration that that first got its hooks into me. But that's really only the the first step. I always say that there are kind of three steps to trying to define what your project is. First is >> what's the sto is something peak your curiosity is get under your skin are you curious about it the second is we talked a little bit about it is there underlying research can you tell the story so I thought well there's an interesting story of survival these these seammen who went around these storms and battled scurvy and then they end up shipwreck and they they descend into this real life Florida the flies well that's a crazy story but could you tell it and then lo and behold I started to find in these archives, all these journals and log books. You could go to England and you could pull out these log books from the 18th century and they would come out in boxes and they would like dust would just come off them and you would heal them and your your shirt would literally be stained purple by the time you were done because all the dis disintegrating binders. Um, and so I thought, whoa, okay, okay, there's a lot here. But the third thing is kind of what is it about ultimately >> deeper themes >> deeper is it about something more. So this added a unbelievable saga that would hold you in its grip. But what is it about? Why should why in the 21st century in 2025 today would we care about this story from the 1740s? And the more I did research, I began to realize that when the survivors of the shipwreck were brought back to England, they were suddenly summoned to face a court marshal for their alleged crimes on the island. And if they didn't tell a convincing tale, they were going to get hanged. And I always thought of this great line from the writer Joan Ddian. You know, we all tell ourselves stories in order to survive. And I thought, "Oh my god, well, they quite literally have to tell a convincing tale because if they don't, they're going to get hanged after everything they've been through." And so they start having this incredible war over the truth. They're each battling each other. They're each shaping their stories, editing their stories, manipulating their stories, and then ultimately the empire comes in and says, you know, do we like any of these stories? And they begin to tell their own story. And so I thought, you know what? We're living through our times of post-truth and battles over truth. And I thought, God, this story kind of feels like a parable. >> Yeah. Have you ever found a story that you felt like there was tension, there was suspense, there was drama that didn't have these deeper themes? >> Oh, that's a good question. Um, yes, in a sense. Um I I'll say like I >> was sometimes drawn to um crime stories >> and um and they kind of they could be very um you know intricate and maybe a bit salacious and they do tell you something about the human condition but ultimately they would just feel they were like kind of these stories I like to read. You know they may be the cover of the New York Post. [laughter] you know, they got these great headlines and you read it, but in the end, they're kind of gothic crime stories. And so they're I I kind of I learn to kind of separate those stories. These stories I do >> like reading them. I do. I like reading them, but would I want to spend years researching and telling? Do they have enough that reveals something as about us other than maybe the the wackiness of the human condition? You know, I have this image of I have two images in my head. The first is like there's that scene in 21 where Bradley Cooper is looking kind of at all the numbers and whatnot as he's thinking about counting cards. And I'm just imagining you in this room with all your notes all over the place like a freaking crazy madman, you know, trying to piece together the narrative. And I also have this image of you like walking through the woods or something or a desert. I don't know, maybe like you're in Lost [laughter] and you're trying to figure out where you're going. And what's the story of that aunt or like that woman who you met who had the who had the file like up in the attic or whatever and you just find these things. You're like, "Oh my goodness, how did I find that?" But always kind of following your nose and >> moving towards some clue without ever being sure that there actually is something right there. >> You don't know. I mean, and and life is a mystery. And often the people I write about have a certain mystery because when you tell other people's stories, you know, in hindsight, you know what happened, right? You know, they found the lost city or they didn't find the lost city or they disappear. >> But the people as they are experiencing these events on they have no idea. If you're on the ship of the wager, you literally don't know what's going to happen in an hour. >> Am I going to fall off the boat? Am I going to drown? Am I ever going to see my wife? I'm never going to hug my baby. They just don't know. you know what is this disease? I don't even know what's causing this disease. Oh yeah. You know, so they have they they live with that. And I do think there is a kinship when you when you when you embark on a story that there is an element of mystery. You don't know what you're going to find. You don't know if your your journey is going to end in disaster. Both maybe your research and and maybe your book will be a disaster. I mean you there's an element of fear and risk and even a little terror uh when you when you embark on these projects cuz you don't know the deno you really don't you don't know what will come out of it and you know sometimes when you're two and a half years in a project you do feel like you're in lost you're like am I ever going to get off this island >> in what way do you value sense of place so I know with the wager you went down to >> wager island to Yeah. Patagonia, Chile. >> So, tell me about that trip and writing the sense of place. >> Yeah. So, it's interesting. Um, I spent the first two years researching that book in archives and I'll be honest, it it never really occurred to me that I might go to Wager Island. I It just seemed like this remote, windswept, cold, barren place. I I didn't How would you even get there? I mean, it's there's not like they're running fairies to Wager Island. They're like, you know, I I'm not from Chile. I wouldn't even know who to hire. Like, so it it it just it didn't even enter my consciousness. I just was in the archives looking at documents. And then about two years in, you just start to say, "Oh, gosh, what do I how do I can I really understand what these people went through? Can I really understand that island unless I see it? Are are they exaggerating in their journals? >> You know, are they are they, you know, they keep saying how cold they are or there's no food. Are they, you know, they are they're backing, you know, are they kind of, you know, >> is it that bad? Is it really that bad? >> Is it that bad? Right. No, you're right. No, you you do, you know, people like to tell dramatic stories. They like to be the hero of their own story. So, I thought, well, and so that's when I, you know, got the Kakamani idea to try to go there. And I found this Chilean captain, uh, who could take me there. It was funny. He sent me a photograph of of the vessel which we'd be going in. And in the photograph, it looked solid, looked, you know, I was like, "This looks like a good vessel to take me." Of course. Then when I got there, it was a fairly small. I can't remember how big it was, but it was not big. Um maybe 30 some feet. I can't remember exactly, but it was topheavy. It was heated by a wood stove. I decided to go in wintertime because that's when the castaways had had become shipwrecked. So I thought I have to understand that period of winter. It was so stormy that for five I think it was 5 days we could not depart. We just stayed on the little boat waiting in the harbor. The coast guard had blocked it off. They said no vessels are allowed out. Which I didn't know they did but they said you can't leave cuz it's that rough. It's that stormy out there. And then eventually we got the clearance and we slipped out. And initially we kind of went in these channels along the coast of Patagonia shielded from the ocean. It felt pretty good, pretty safe. My confidence was growing. We would uh stop on these little isllets um and the captain and one of the crewmen would go off and they would chop down wood for the stove to heat keep the vessel warm. They would take a little hose and run it off the boat into these islands, these little islands into the glacial streams to get water for the vessel. I will say it was the coldest shower I had ever taken. I mean, it was so cold that I think I re I think I might have only taken one shower the whole time. It was it was just frizz. But and then after about a week of this, the captain says, "You know, if we're going to get to Wager Island, which is situated in a a gulf known as the um the Gulf of Sorrow, or as some translated as the Gulf of Pain, >> we're going to now have to go out into the ocean." And that's when I got my first glimpse of those seas. And I will say what's also interesting about this journey is I don't write about any of it in the book. >> Huh. >> But it all informed it. And so I got my first glimpse of these seas. Uh we weren't even in some huge storm, but the seas were uh pretty enormous. Um windy. We just had to I just sat on the deck of this vessel. Uh you could not stand. If you stand, you would, you know, you might break something. You would get thrown. Things were getting tossed all about. I I I literally was sitting there in a billagege pump just goes flying past my head. I'm like, "Okay, [laughter] just sit down." I had taken every I'm used to the sea, but I took everything to to ward off seasickness. I mean, I was basically half drunk on Dramamine. I had the thing on the wrist. I had the whatever the drugs you put up behind your ears and just kind of stay there. And the the funny part that always always amuses me is that I I didn't know how to pass the time and I just kept looking out the port hole and I think I'm going to throw up. So, what am I going to do? And I had on my iPhone with me uh an audible of Moby Dick. >> Oh, wow. So I put into my earphones just to listen there. I'm sitting like this listening to Moby Dick on the floor because you you again I'm on the deck just sitting there like this bracing myself and it's like you're in a tin can. You're just going like this and I'm thinking God this is the greatest I think this is the greatest American novel I've ever read. This is just incredible. The worst novel the worst novel to listen to. I was going to say, >> you know, you're listening to you're listening to Ahab lead these these poor people on his mono maniac uh obsession. Um uh but our captain was skilled. He wasn't a habian and he did manage to get us to the island. >> Well, so last year I went to Patagonia and I was looking up where Wager Island was. It's a it's a little bit north of Torpine. So it's so it's decently up the coast. It's like right at the top of Patonia and we did a trip basically to the Cape >> and it was the same sort of thing. We, you know, we're in a little bit of bigger ship, but we were going through all the inlets. You know, you'd read about in school. Oh yeah. You know, the sailors would go down, the ships would crash. Super dangerous. >> And the first few days we'd go through the little inlets. I'm like, what are you talking about? Like calm waters. I go water skiing on these >> on this glass. And then there was like our third or fourth day and they said tonight we're going to go out into the Pacific. Uh so it might get a little topsyturvy, but they're like it's good weather tonight so we can do it. >> And uh we finished dinner and we, you know, I go to sleep and then at around 2 or 3 in the morning, I woke up because the ship was just boom boom boom boom. And I woke up. I was like, "Oh my goodness, this is what we read about in school. I'm going to go outside." So I get my stuff and I start walking around the boat and everything is falling over. And it is pitch black, middle of the night, deep dense fog. You not even close to seeing the stars. And uh I go outside. I open the door and I go, "Nope." And I close it immediately. I'm like, "If I go outside, I will die." >> So what do I do? go up to the third or fourth uh deck of you know it was a small cruise basically and I was on the third or fourth floor probably 50 ft up and every 20 to 30 seconds the waves were so intense but the water would splash the window >> and I'm telling you in that moment I understood why people revere someone like Sir Francis Drake like the kind of courage the audacity in order to go sail like that I just had no idea. And I had that visceral sense of it. And uh from that I'm like, yes, that's why you would go down because there's no way that you can pick up on that by reading about it. The terror, the fear, >> you have to feel it. You have to see it. And it it it just helps you get closer to the people you write about to understand them. and and you what's amazing is like in my own experience I'm only glimpsing a fraction of the level of storm and sea and tumult that the seaman encountered cuz they had come across Cape Horn in a the perfect hurricane where they have waves that are dwarfing you know a 90ft mast the strongest currents on earth their sail they couldn't even fly their sails they had all blown out and they were tipping 45°. I mean, the ships were breaking apart. I mean, it just but but it allows you to to to to have that kind of emotional connection, for lack of a better word. And then eventually we did get to the island and, you know, we anchored off it and then we took a little zodiac and we went on the island and you know, even just a small detail, we, you know, we've talked a lot about research. So in their journals they kept saying it's cold, it's cold. Now when I was sitting in New York, I just put it into my computer. What is the temperature in that part of Patagonia in wintertime? Yeah. I said about 32. And I said, well, okay, that's cold, but it's not Antarctica. But then when I got there, I was like, oh no, it's really cold because it was blowing about 25 to 30 miles per hour off the ocean every day, just hitting the hitting hitting the island. It's also always raining or sleeping. And so it suddenly occurred to me the smallest thing. I was like, "Oh, they all had hypothermia." That had not even occurred to me. For two years I was doing the research. They would have known the term hypothermia. I was like, "Oh." And then you have, "Well, how would hypothermia affect their decision-making?" So, you know, you're just getting these these these subtle shifts of deeper understandings, getting closer uh to your material. They always said, "Well, we couldn't find any food on the island." And I was like, "Oh, come on. There's got to be something. There's got to be a Walmart or at least a Whole Foods. >> Yeah, you got to get something there. And and you get there like there really are no animals. There's some birds that fly around, but and they had some clams they exhausted, but that was it. There was some celery which they had eaten which helped cure their scurvy, which I tasted, but that was really it. And you know, you talked about understanding the seas when you had climbed the ship. And you know, there's a there was a great line from a a British officer who had described the island as a place where the soul of man dies in him. And when I stood on that island, I said, "Okay, I understand why the soul of a man would die and I'm sitting here trapped on this on this island." And then there was, you know, we talk about revelation, right? And revelation is the surprise, the kind of unexpected. And so when we were on that island, the captain at one point said to us, pointed to a stream, and he said, "Uh, you know, take a look over here." And in that water was this timber. And they were about five or seven yards long, these thick pieces of timber. They didn't have nails. There was no metal in them, but you could see they were held together, these kind of round wooden pegs called tree nails. And they are the remnants of an 18th century ship believed to be from his majesty ship, the wager. >> And that was all that remained. I mean, I just kept staring at that wood because after all that ferocious struggle, because on that island there had been coup and counter coup and cannibalism and a murder and more than one murder and and and and yet that was all that remained uh from that ferocious struggle. The biggest lie that writers will tell themselves is I'll remember that later. No, I mean there's so many times when I'm listening to a podcast that I want to save something and I just never end up saving it cuz typing [music] it into the phone is just too much work, you know? Well, I found a great solution to that problem. It's called Podcast Magic and they're the sponsor of this episode. So, what you do, super easy. [music] Say you're listening on Apple or on Spotify. If you find a bit in this conversation that you really like, just take a screenshot of it and then email it to podcastmagicsublime.app. If you email it like a minute later, you'll get an email back with the transcript, the context, all the information that you need. And then that way, you don't need to write down all the information. So, if you find something in the conversation that you really like, well, check out Podcast Magic. All right, let's get to the interview. You know, we've been talking a lot about place. >> Yeah. >> Talking about people because people are so core to these stories and you were talking about a little bit earlier with the descriptions of people. And as you think about piecing together characters and even more specifically describing them, turning them not turn them into not two-dimensional people but three-dimensional ones that we can actually you know Captain Byron like how do we really understand this guy? How do you think about doing that? So, you know, it does begin with underlying material. Um, any documents, any letter you're trying, you know, journalism or non-fiction or history, you are a external observer, >> you know, it's different than a film. I've had films made on my stories. It's different that you are internal. >> You know, the camera may be outside, but you have actors playing these people, animating them, playing them inside them. As a non-fiction writer, you can't do that. I mean, you don't you don't you unless you described a wink or a tear, you don't know that happened to them. So, you're trying to get as close to their consciousness as possible >> in writing. >> In writing. And you do that through finding every scrap, every letter, every piece of writing, every observation. What house did they grow up on? Grow up in. What did that house look like? Okay. Maybe what did did did their relatives write anything about them? Who were their ancestors? Where did they come from? What was their lineage? What was their class? Um, you you are trying as best you can to to understand them and and and let's say they're in a profession and how did other people describe that profession. So, you're trying to learn everything uh you you possibly can to bring them to life. And I always say that the job is not to romanticize the people you write about or to do hegeography to make people seem better than they are to gloss over their their their foibless or their sins and you're also trying not to exculpate them. You write about some really bad people and you are not there to absolve them, but your job is to understand them and to show them as fully rendered as you can. And you feel a certain moral responsibility to write about them even if it's 300 years later than they lived and you know they will never see a single word you write about them. How do you think about if you have 10,000 descriptions of somebody, 10,000 words, how do you think about the ones that you choose? You know, I was prepping for this and I was thinking about what is the difference between realism and impressionistic and I was like, I don't I I wonder how JK Rowling describes Hagrid. And so I went and I pulled it up and this is how it begins. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair. >> And I was like, "Okay, that's a pretty good description." And we're not getting the whole description of Hagrid, but man, you can you can see what's going on there. Selective description. >> Yes. And and and you know, it's funny. you are always looking for the quote or the phrase that cuts to some essence or when you hear, you know, it's not so different from when you when you're in a conversation with somebody and someone says something really interesting. You may have been talking at a dinner and much of it will just kind of fade away, but you'll remember a couple little bits. And when you're doing research, it's not dissimilar. And you're also like, for example, whether it be a physical description, but I'm also even interested in the way people talk. So what is their diction? Their diction reveals something about them. It may reveal their level of education. Uh may reveal their mannerism and >> speed of speech >> speed. Are they a quick talker? And so the all these little bits that reveal uh the essence of who they are. >> Yeah. And people wrote about those things. >> Well, you can. So in some cases it's through a written medium. So you're looking at how they write. So for example, the gunner on the wager who was not from the upper class, so he knew he could never be a captain. And uh but he was very literate and he he has the best account of what happened in terms of the level of detail and depth. And he wrote the way his character is. He did not write the way most people wrote in the 18th century because most of the people wrote were all from the >> upper class >> aristocracy and it tended to be a very baroque kind of style very ornate and in a way it really doesn't translate very well I mean not a lot of great writing for that period um he wrote like a bullet he wrote like Hemingway he wrote the way he was direct action no adjectives no adverbs and so you you're getting something from him >> totally yeah earlier You were talking about these strange combination of words like you were talking about the perfect hurricane. >> But I came across this one. Arrested while in prison. >> Tell me about that. >> Yeah. So, that's one of those things we talked a little bit about trying to find a story. Uh how do you come across one? And I used to always read the the briefs, especially when there were a lot of uh uh municipal newspapers. Unfortunately, there not as many of them. And you know, they would always have that column where they just do these little summaries of the news. And I remember I was scanning the briefs in some California newspaper. I was reading they're usually an inch. They're usually like two sentences >> and I came across a story that was describing the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang. Um and it said >> that sounds terrifying. >> They were terrifying. And it said several of them had >> I do not want to have a beer with those guys. >> Yeah, they're they're they're probably worse than the seas around Cape Horn. In any case, they, you know, it said that several of them had been arrested while in prison and some had been in solitary confinement, the leaders. And I just thought arrested while in prison. That bizarro combination of words, you know, a little bit like the details we talk about that that you might hear in speech or something. I just thought arrested in prison, arrested. Like who gets arrested while they're already in prison? And then I started >> those feels like antonyms. >> Yeah. And then I just started to ask myself some basic questions like and then some of them were in solitary confinement. I said so how do you even run a gang for solitary? How can you be a gang leader if you're in solitary? How do you communicate? What is your tender? And so all these questions started to emerge. But it just started from that. We talked about what is it that seizes you? It was just those words. I remember that that's that article is about that long. And then it led to a very long story and investigation of the Aryan Brotherhood, the most murderous prison gay. >> Let's talk about this. Um, do you want to read it or >> you can read it or I can read it? Whatever. >> Yeah, I want to hear you read it. >> Okay, sure. Um, >> so, um, in May, when coyotes howl beneath an unnervingly large moon, taller plants such as spider warts and blackeyed susans begin to creep over the tinier bloom, stealing their light and water. The necks of the smaller flowers break and their petals flutter away, and before long, they are buried underground. This is why the Oage Indians refer to May as the time of the flower killing moon. So what's going on here? How do you think about as you're thinking about constructing a paragraph like this? What are the elements? >> That you see? >> So um this in many ways I thought was a metaphor uh for the book and what I would be writing. Um the Oage uh name each month after a particular moon and in the month of May um in their tradition is this little flower killing moon because all these beautiful little flowers that describe they spread over the uh over the prairie. Um they look almost like confetti and then the taller plants come and steal their law water and light and they begin to die off. And it's in the month May when one of the first murders takes place. um in this reign of terror. And so that is why I began uh in May and why I wanted to describe this moon. And I thought it was very important to also anchor you in the Oage tradition since this is an Oage story. Tell about this. The spider warts, the blackeyed susans, the large moon, the tall plants, the coyotes. like, you know, if you were to almost circle all the things that you can see, um, like how much do you think about this as I'm going to paint a painting versus I'm just going to, I don't know, share a few details and make sure that there's a bunch of symbolism, a kind of realism versus impressionism. >> Well, you you're looking for some of the most uh, you know, the vivid language, especially here, because you are painting a scene. And, you know, we talked a little bit about arrested while in prison. there are certain phrases and um when I was just doing the research there's a wonderful Osage writer called John Joseph Matthews and he really is a unbelievable describer of nature and he has a book called talking talking moons I believe it's called where he describes these moons and there are certain words which were just so beautiful so spider warts it's just a word it's just but in itself is a it's just an evocative word blackeyed susans I mean people who name things have sometimes there are wonderful names and descriptors and so they're just poetic. It's just poetic language and it's just their names. But, you know, you could have said such as, you know, you could pick some boring name or some non vivid name. It it so happens that those particular details create an image and have a power just in their very name. >> Yeah. It also, you know, we talk about setting and it it it it brings you into the prairie, you know, it brings you into this part of the world, into the Oage tradition and into a setting uh where this is going to take place. >> And for someone like me, that's very striking because, you know, I'm a New Yorker and um you know, I had never been to a prairie. I don't think I'm pretty sure I'd never been to a prairie. Not like that. Certainly never some vast open. They are expansive are they go forever flat. Yeah. And and and and and the tall grass the the blue grass tall grass just it it looks like an ocean when it blows in the wind. And so you know for me part of finding words for language is also trying to find words that help allow me to understand the world I'm writing about. Yeah. I always think about Robert Cara when he was writing his biographies of Lynden B. Johnson. He wanted to go out and he needed to write about the Hill Country where LBJ was from and he said, "I need to go move there." And actually lived there for 3 years. And you can feel the time that he spent there and the way that he describes the limestone rock and the the architecture, the shacks there. I I mean it was striking because I ended up going to LBJ's ranch a few years ago and it was like the least surprising experience ever. It was like I had been there already >> because Yeah. Well, Carol is a hero and it's interesting that you mentioned that because I uh had obviously read that book and um and LBJ part of the part of his series and I remember I had read an interview with him and where he he had described kind of being out there and like camping out in that area and when I was working on Killers of the Flower Moon um again having not spent much time in a prairie um I was descri writing about a woman, Molly Burkhard, whose family is being kind of systematically killed during this period. And I read about how when she was a young girl, she had been forcibly uprooted from her lodge where she had lived on the prairie and ma and made to go to this boarding school. Um, and I found the trail that she had taken. I was told the trail she would have taken. I was told it was a two-day trip to get there. She would have gone back then because she would have gone in a in a in a wagon with a horse. And so I decided you could the trail was now mostly covered up and overgrown and you couldn't drive through it, but you could drive at least partway into it. And I spent the night there where she would have spent the night just camping out in the prairie so I could just see what the prairie was like at night, what would it have been like, what was the sky like, the vastness. I didn't write any of it. It was it didn't write any of it because it was me. It was my own trip and but it was just again helping me get somehow feel closer to the people I write about to understand what they would have been imagining just I just sat there thinking what would it have been like to be a seven or eight year old girl forcibly uprooted from your home your tradition suddenly being hauled across this period to go as far as you have been to go to a boarding school where you could no longer speak the Oage language. >> Yeah. How do you think about suspense? Because the way that I discovered your work is my friend Sam, he read he read the wager and he was like, "Dude, I just read this in one sitting. I never do that. >> You need to look into this guy's writing. Like it's just you just can't stop reading. You can't stop reading." How do you think about creating that? I've heard that >> from so many people about about your writing. >> Yeah. So, I mean, the the dirty little secret is often really simple. Um, which is I tell most of my stories chronologically. >> I tell them, you know, you may have a prologue that will hook the reader and kind of lay out the suspense that you're going to get, but let's say you're going on the ship of the wager. Well, that's a a life and and a a voyage in particular. There's a reason that so many narratives grew out of these sea tales because it mirrors a plot, right? I mean, you're getting on a ship. >> You're going to be heading out into a place you may not know. You're going to face elements that are going to test your character that you may never uh shackle. >> Yeah. Like a shackle, right? And it's going to test your character. It's going to reveal your character. Um and you never know how it's going to end. And so, so um so part of it is just telling it in chronological order. The key is to describe things and see things the way the people you're writing about saw them and experience them. Not with the power of hindsight. Yeah. So I when I'm writing it, I know what's going to happen to all these people, right? I know what happened, but when they're living it, they don't. >> They're living in suspense. >> They might not see their wives and their children. >> They don't know anything. So that's the mindset you want to capture. I always say when you if you tell a story with hindsight you impose that knowledge that is an artifice that is not the way history is lived that is not the way we are living this conversation we don't know how the conversation will end we do not know what will happen later today and that is the way people experience history you live inside of history um and so I always try to tell it with that level of suspense that people went through now many of the stories I'm writing about have inherent suspense And there are things you do structurally and you you know you you think and you you the story even if you're telling it um uh you know chronologically where do you end a chapter? I mean there are certain kind of little tools and mechanics that you you do use and um you know I read a lot of suspense fiction that probably helps. [laughter] Where and how do you end a chapter? I mean I just opened up to a random page page 110 right here. The wager was alone at sea left to its own destiny. >> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Got to go to chapter seven. >> Got to go to chap. Right. And and you're aware of that. And you kind of have when when I think of a story, I think of it in kind of there are two dimensions of the suspense. There's the suspense of where is the whole story going to end, right? But then also where are these momentary scenes going to end? And you want the you want the suspense. So you have this kind of larger name. >> Do you write to the last sentence? >> You know, it's very funny that you say that. So, not always. For the wager, I had from my trip a last line in my head after I made my trip that I thought I would end the book on. And for a couple years, I was like, my last line will be something about, you know, the only sound was the eternal hush of the sea. I quite liked it. It was very poetic. And I wrote it when I got to the end. And then I looked at it and I looked at it and I thought it's poetic but the sentence preceding it speaks to the larger themes. And so I ended up cutting it. I had to kill you know they always say kill your darling. >> Talking about killing a darling. >> Yeah you had to kill your darling. And uh so yes that was one. >> And then how do you think about those prologuses like bringing people into >> Yeah. It's Yeah. You want >> because you you said you struggle with those a little bit more, right? were very hard. I find them the hardest because you know they're a little bit more um you know you're looking at a story way above. I like to kind of be in the weeds with the story and with a prologue you're kind of how much do you give away? You're trying to make sure you can pull the reader in. Why? Why do you care about this story? Look, I know the world in which we live. >> The world in which we live is a world in which I live. >> Oop ding. My phone just beeped. Oop. Oh, I hear someone's Spotify music playing. Oh, uh, there's a new movie out. Oop, uh, this great podcast I can listen to. And so, you are competing for human beings attention. And so, part of the thing you're trying to do in the prologue is to say, okay, come along with me, you know, come along with me for a journey. What do you think you're trying to say? Like, hey, here's I'm framing this story. Here's why it's important. Here's why it's worth your time. like what are the core questions that a prologue should answer. >> Yeah. So I think you want to have some element of uh usually um you know let's say let's talk about the lost city of Z. It was the first book I did >> about explorers who disappeared in the Amazon and explore with his older son in 1925 looking for this place he called the city of Z. And um and then I followed in his footsteps to see what I could learn about what had happened to him and whether this city really existed and if it did, what would it how would it transform our understanding of what the Americas looked like before the rival Columbus? Well, on my own journey, there was a period when I got lost in the jungle. So that's going to happen towards the very end of the book, but I plot myself down at least in the prologue, you know, with myself lost, but then weaving in the stakes of the story, what was about to give you a sense. And so you don't know what's going to happen to me. And uh I'm sitting here so you know, we do know I made it out. But that's enough so you have a bit of a cliffhanger. and I could weave in and it's very short, you know, I don't remember what it was, but you know, it's like 800 words, a thousand words, you know, it's short, but it's just enough to hook you. You say, "Okay, I gotta know what's going to happen." But also, I'm subtly weaving in the themes and the stakes of this narrative because what you're ask what you're doing in the prologue is you're saying, "Trust me. >> Trust me. Be with me. There's a reason I'm telling this story." Um, and there are some stakes to it. Um, there's some suspense to it, there some meaning to it. Hopefully, there's some beauty to it. And you just need to do enough of that to hopefully get them to come along uh on a much longer journey. >> As you think of the prologue versus the main event of the book, how much do you think about your role as David Gran? Is it like, man, I love it when my grandpa or my uncle tells stories, you know, Uncle John, he just has a way of telling a story, or do you think more of, hey, no, I'm going to kind of remove myself a little bit from this. I am more in service of the story, and I don't really want my personality to be a big part of it. >> Yeah, it's a really good question. So, I'm a generalist and the subjects I write about are always new. I don't know much anything about them, usually before I begin. And what matters is the story. >> It is what is the story about? What is its meaning? What is its depth? And your goal as an author, I always have some ideal form in my head that there is some ideal structure that the way the story should be told that's separate from yourself and you're almost like a detective trying to figure out what is the structure, what is the voice. You are always in service to the story. I will insert myself into a story when I think it will help the story. It will advance it. It will help the reader. It will give the reader some eyes and ears. If that is not important or needed for the story, I will vanish from the story. >> What's an example of when you would do that? >> So, Lost City of Z was a was an example where um and it was very hard for me at first to insert myself because I had never really done that really. I had to reveal something about myself because I thought it was so important to compare both the past and the present, what had happened to the Amazon to show everything in that I alternate chapters. So, you're seeing you're learning about exploration in the in the Victorian Eduardian period and then you're learning about it when you go to these fancy stores and get your goods or you know you get to take a malarial pill. How has the world changed? And so, you were always alternating. I remember when I first gave my that book, the manuscript to a friend to read and they said, you know, David, it's it's good, but you know, you gotta put a little more of yourself into it. And and the truth is, I'm like Larry David. And so I had to put Larry David into my manuscript that this is Larry David in the jungle. Sorry, Larry. I don't know where you are, Larry. I hope I get to meet you one day. But in any case, um, you know, but you know, that is that became a little bit of a shick, but that is true. I I don't hunt. I don't camp. I hate all that stuff. I hate bugs. And so the idea of me in the jungle, I had to put that in to the book, but it was, but the first time I did it, I was kind of a ghost. I was just kind of like, and here I am in the, you know, this is what I see. Um, so that was hard. And then we talked a little bit about the wager. So I made this trip to Wager Island. And there was a time when I thought, well, that might be a really interesting end to the book. Uh, and then when I got there, I said, you know what, doesn't belong. Why am I here? I don't belong here in this story. So, it was very helpful to my reporting. There's not going to be a word about me. And so, um, I try the best I can to let the story dictate the decisions I make. I want to read this opening sentence. Here's how you start the wager. And I'm curious to hear why you wrote it like this. The only impartial witness was the sun. For days it watched as the strange object heaved up and down the ocean, tossed mercilessly by the wind and the waves. Once or twice the vessel nearly smashed into a reef, which might have ended our story. Yet somehow, whether through destiny, as some would later proclaim, or dumb luck, it drifted into an inlet off the southeastern coast of Brazil, where several inhabitants laid eyes upon it. So, um, I struggled for the first sentence for that book. Sometimes you have a first sentence, sometimes you don't. I wrote that sentence fairly late. I think I might have even had the full manuscript. >> Really? >> Yeah. And it and it started it was almost only when I kind of finished the book and kind of understood it that I I I was able to execute. I mean I had something in there but it was not that the sum was the only impartial witness because this is a book that is ultimately about a fight over the truth and it's a fight of versions of the story and it's a lot about what we're talking about. It is how people tell their stories. How do they construct them? How do they shape them? How do they edit them? How do they sometimes manipulate them? And so you are going to go on a journey where you are going to hear waring perspectives. >> And so this idea that there is an impartial witness that it was the sun >> um just occurred to me. So it's again it's this metaphor that >> fit the subject of the book and it's also literally true. So it's factually true. You know, they were on this boat and the sun is looking down on them. There's nothing else around. But everyone in that boat, everyone who had been on that island is going to have a different version and everyone is going to be partial. >> I didn't make the impartial witness sun connection. >> Yep. I totally see that. Tell me about overdescribing versus underdescribing and what it's like both in your first draft as you're trying to make the writing vivid and then as you're kind of duking it out with an editor saying ah it's a little much man you know. >> Yeah. So um you know I'll give you a very concrete example and I described a little bit about these outlines I will construct. So in the first chapter of the wager they are getting ready to set off on this voyage and they have to find a ship and prepare the ship and load the ship. So I, you know, as somebody who had no idea what a 18th century ship was like, uh, became very fascinated, found British historians to give me these tutorials. I went to England, I visited, uh, Nelson ship, you know, >> I want to go on a research trip with you. >> Yeah, these [laughter] sound fun. >> Yeah. No, it was great. And you know, you're walking around, you see the cannons. You see all these stuff. And you know, you learn how the how these ships were built and they had to find a wood that was curved to fit the bends and and how, you know, for the mass they would deforest colonies in the Americas to bring over the wood that they needed a more flexible wood for that. So, you're doing all this research and you have hundreds of pages outlines and and um and you start to write it and you're just obsessed with all these details. I've spent I don't know how long researching how you would build and load a ship. And then uh my first editor uh is my wife uh oh Kira Darren who's a wonderful journalist uh runs runs a company called Retroport and just a great journalist does documentaries and um so she was my first reader. She always is. She always has been. And I will give her my first chapter very nervously because imagine it's your first chapter. You're like oh my god nobody has seen any of this. I finally spent years researching this. I'm putting my first words on the page and uh so you give it to her and then I will see her sit down with her pen and I will peer through the corner. She doesn't know I'm there just kind of like trying to trying to gauge her reactions. What are her expressions? And then inevitably and I certainly heard it on chapter one of the wager. She was reading and suddenly I hear oh god no god no. And that was where I had written 10,000 or 20,000 words on the building of a ship. And no normal reader would ever have had the patience for my um you know that endless description and I had to cut it. First it's like you're mad and you're this and you stomp around and but you know ultimately when you calm down I knew she was right. >> Right. And then you take that 10,000 words and you distill it to the most revealing. That's where you get the best details. What are the best details? Distill it. You know what are the most astonishing facts you learn? Not every fact you learn. The most a took 4,000 trees as I recall to build one of these shed. 4,000 trees. That's a fact worth keeping. >> Yes. >> And so >> it's dense the economy of language there. >> The economy of language. And sometimes you can do more with less. And I will say for something like the wager because there's a lot there's some setup to the wager where you have to introduce people to a world they're not familiar with because you're not writing about the you know you're not even writing about the 1950s where you where we have some images that we come it's an 18 1740. Most people have no idea what's a dockyard. So you have a lot more you have to set up. But you know up until the very end of the wager I was trying to cut it down because I I didn't want the beginning. I had to learn so much to understand the world >> just myself >> to understand the world of the wager. >> Yes. These people where they're coming. I had to learn a lot more. And so, but what did I actually need to get it to its essence? And so I up until the very end. And I do think you have to be willing to cut. You really do. You cannot get so wedded. >> Here's the truth. It might have taken me five years to find a fact, to locate it, to find the letter. The reader does not care at all about the backstory of you getting that fact. >> All they care about is what is on the page >> and what they see and what they hear and what images it creates. And so you need to separate research from what you're trying to communicate with the research. And you're always trying to communicate something with an economy of languages that gets to the essence and brings something to life without bogging it down. You know, you don't need 10,000 words describing the weather. Nobody cares. >> Yeah. Perfect hurricane kind of. >> Yeah. Yeah. and like what you know what were the winds or you know you just have a few like how did the rain fall perhaps but you just are trying and sometimes there's one scene that just tells you everything you need I'll give you an example >> when they were coming around Cape Horn I found in one of the journals a description of how they could not fly their sails because it was so windy and so they're just tossing about in these you know 60 70 foot waves these wooden vessels that are kind of splintering and And the captain couldn't control a ship 01:0:0,470 --> 01:0:3,280 01:0:0,480 --> 01:0:6,000 without sails. So what did he do? He 01:0:3,270 --> 01:0:6,000 01:0:3,280 --> 01:0:9,599 ordered some of the seaman to climb the 01:0:5,990 --> 01:0:9,599 01:0:6,000 --> 01:0:12,319 mass and to hold on to the rigging with 01:0:9,589 --> 01:0:12,319 01:0:9,599 --> 01:0:14,880 their bodies and use them as concave 01:0:12,309 --> 01:0:14,880 01:0:12,319 --> 01:0:17,440 sails while the vessel was going 45 01:0:14,870 --> 01:0:17,440 01:0:14,880 --> 01:0:21,119 degrees to one side and then 45 degrees 01:0:17,430 --> 01:0:21,119 01:0:17,440 --> 01:0:23,599 to the other like this. That tell I mean 01:0:21,109 --> 01:0:23,599 01:0:21,119 --> 01:0:25,920 that is so vivid and tells you so much 01:0:23,589 --> 01:0:25,920 01:0:23,599 --> 01:0:29,760 about the storm and what it was like for 01:0:25,910 --> 01:0:29,760 01:0:25,920 --> 01:0:31,359 those seammen. Yeah. 01:0:29,750 --> 01:0:31,359 01:0:29,760 --> 01:0:33,119 What part of the process gives you the 01:0:31,349 --> 01:0:33,119 01:0:31,359 --> 01:0:36,599 most joy and what part of the process 01:0:33,109 --> 01:0:36,599 01:0:33,119 --> 01:0:36,599 gives you terror? 01:0:36,630 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:0:36,640 --> 01:0:42,400 It's a good question.

And I think too 01:5:17,190 --> 01:5:20,799 01:5:17,200 --> 01:5:24,160 often we conflate the mediums because I 01:5:20,789 --> 01:5:24,160 01:5:20,799 --> 01:5:26,480 think a film is is is you're able to 01:5:24,150 --> 01:5:26,480 01:5:24,160 --> 01:5:28,799 inhabit people. You know, I suddenly saw 01:5:26,470 --> 01:5:28,799 01:5:26,480 --> 01:5:31,200 actors playing people I only knew in two 01:5:28,789 --> 01:5:31,200 01:5:28,799 --> 01:5:34,640 dimensions on paper. So they're very 01:5:31,190 --> 01:5:34,640 01:5:31,200 --> 01:5:38,000 different mediums. But I will say 01:5:34,630 --> 01:5:38,000 01:5:34,640 --> 01:5:39,839 there is a visualness to the medium that 01:5:37,990 --> 01:5:39,839 01:5:38,000 --> 01:5:41,760 I think influences us all even as 01:5:39,829 --> 01:5:41,760 01:5:39,839 --> 01:5:45,520 writers just the way writers influence 01:5:41,750 --> 01:5:45,520 01:5:41,760 --> 01:5:48,799 film. And so I think it's how you 01:5:45,510 --> 01:5:48,799 01:5:45,520 --> 01:5:51,119 construct scenes and around people who 01:5:48,789 --> 01:5:51,119 01:5:48,799 --> 01:5:53,760 are interesting and capture them and 01:5:51,109 --> 01:5:53,760 01:5:51,119 --> 01:5:56,960 reveal them. Those elements are shared 01:5:53,750 --> 01:5:56,960 01:5:53,760 --> 01:5:59,200 and you know a lot of my stories and 01:5:56,950 --> 01:5:59,200 01:5:56,960 --> 01:6:1,839 books have been turned into film without 01:5:59,190 --> 01:6:1,839 01:5:59,200 --> 01:6:4,480 me ever thinking about that. And I just 01:6:1,829 --> 01:6:4,480 01:6:1,839 --> 01:6:7,839 think that is that connection where if 01:6:4,470 --> 01:6:7,839 01:6:4,480 --> 01:6:10,160 it's a if it's a powerful story 01:6:7,829 --> 01:6:10,160 01:6:7,839 --> 01:6:13,440 um you know they can be told in these 01:6:10,150 --> 01:6:13,440 01:6:10,160 --> 01:6:16,400 different mediums. Um 01:6:13,430 --> 01:6:16,400 01:6:13,440 --> 01:6:19,520 and one of the things you you one of the 01:6:16,390 --> 01:6:19,520 01:6:16,400 --> 01:6:24,559 things that film does that I think 01:6:19,510 --> 01:6:24,559 01:6:19,520 --> 01:6:26,880 should be done in good writing is 01:6:24,549 --> 01:6:26,880 01:6:24,559 --> 01:6:30,000 you see the room. 01:6:26,870 --> 01:6:30,000 01:6:26,880 --> 01:6:32,160 >> You see it. You see these people. you 01:6:29,990 --> 01:6:32,160 01:6:30,000 --> 01:6:33,680 hear them. And so part of the things 01:6:32,150 --> 01:6:33,680 01:6:32,160 --> 01:6:35,119 you're trying to do with writing now, 01:6:33,670 --> 01:6:35,119 01:6:33,680 --> 01:6:37,039 it's a very it's a different medium. 01:6:35,109 --> 01:6:37,039 01:6:35,119 --> 01:6:38,319 You're trying to use words to convey 01:6:37,029 --> 01:6:38,319 01:6:37,039 --> 01:6:40,799 01:6:38,309 --> 01:6:40,799 01:6:38,319 --> 01:6:44,480 >> But you are trying to do each reach at 01:6:40,789 --> 01:6:44,480 01:6:40,799 --> 01:6:47,359 that point of visualness, 01:6:44,470 --> 01:6:47,359 01:6:44,480 --> 01:6:49,680 of vividness, of depth through one 01:6:47,349 --> 01:6:49,680 01:6:47,359 --> 01:6:52,640 through words, one through film. So I 01:6:49,670 --> 01:6:52,640 01:6:49,680 --> 01:6:54,079 don't think of them that much. I never 01:6:52,630 --> 01:6:54,079 01:6:52,640 --> 01:6:55,599 think like, oh, this would be a good 01:6:54,069 --> 01:6:55,599 01:6:54,079 --> 01:6:57,280 I've never once thought this would be a 01:6:55,589 --> 01:6:57,280 01:6:55,599 --> 01:7:0,960 good movie. draw out a little bit more 01:6:57,270 --> 01:7:0,960 01:6:57,280 --> 01:7:2,480 of the of the film is like this, books 01:7:0,950 --> 01:7:2,480 01:7:0,960 --> 01:7:4,000 are like that. Film is like this, books 01:7:2,470 --> 01:7:4,000 01:7:2,480 --> 01:7:5,200 are like that. I want to feel like we 01:7:3,990 --> 01:7:5,200 01:7:4,000 --> 01:7:10,000 haven't gotten to the bottom of this. 01:7:5,190 --> 01:7:10,000 01:7:5,200 --> 01:7:12,400 >> Yeah, sure. So, here is an example. 01:7:9,990 --> 01:7:12,400 01:7:10,000 --> 01:7:14,799 We've talked about research. 01:7:12,390 --> 01:7:14,799 01:7:12,400 --> 01:7:18,720 Sometimes people say, why did you write 01:7:14,789 --> 01:7:18,720 01:7:14,799 --> 01:7:21,039 it this way or why did you, you know, 01:7:18,710 --> 01:7:21,039 01:7:18,720 --> 01:7:25,200 choose this scene? 01:7:21,029 --> 01:7:25,200 01:7:21,039 --> 01:7:28,559 as a historian or a non-fiction writer, 01:7:25,190 --> 01:7:28,559 01:7:25,200 --> 01:7:32,079 you are handcuffed. 01:7:28,549 --> 01:7:32,079 01:7:28,559 --> 01:7:36,640 >> You are handcuffed. I don't open a story 01:7:32,069 --> 01:7:36,640 01:7:32,079 --> 01:7:39,359 and say, "I'm going to begin here." 01:7:36,630 --> 01:7:39,359 01:7:36,640 --> 01:7:42,240 Um, I look at all these pieces of 01:7:39,349 --> 01:7:42,240 01:7:39,359 --> 01:7:44,079 material I have. This is all the 01:7:42,230 --> 01:7:44,079 01:7:42,240 --> 01:7:46,319 material I have. I don't have any more 01:7:44,069 --> 01:7:46,319 01:7:44,079 --> 01:7:46,799 material. I can't go over there, 01:7:46,309 --> 01:7:46,799 01:7:46,319 --> 01:7:49,280 >> right? 01:7:46,789 --> 01:7:49,280 01:7:46,799 --> 01:7:50,720 >> I can't go into this room, right? Oh, 01:7:49,270 --> 01:7:50,720 01:7:49,280 --> 01:7:53,440 boy. I wish they had said something 01:7:50,710 --> 01:7:53,440 01:7:50,720 --> 01:7:56,880 there. They didn't say anything. I can't 01:7:53,430 --> 01:7:56,880 01:7:53,440 --> 01:7:58,079 write that. I, you know, I, you know, 01:7:56,870 --> 01:7:58,079 01:7:56,880 --> 01:8:0,000 there not going to be a lot of scenes in 01:7:58,069 --> 01:8:0,000 01:7:58,079 --> 01:8:1,920 bedrooms. Um, you know, just let's put 01:7:59,990 --> 01:8:1,920 01:8:0,000 --> 01:8:5,760 it in their journal, you know. Um, and 01:8:1,910 --> 01:8:5,760 01:8:1,920 --> 01:8:8,880 so the puzzle is how do you make it work 01:8:5,750 --> 01:8:8,880 01:8:5,760 --> 01:8:11,520 with these pieces you have? Sometimes 01:8:8,870 --> 01:8:11,520 01:8:8,880 --> 01:8:14,880 you begin books partly based on what the 01:8:11,510 --> 01:8:14,880 01:8:11,520 --> 01:8:17,359 underlying research tells you and allows 01:8:14,870 --> 01:8:17,359 01:8:14,880 --> 01:8:19,440 you to begin. That's the scene that the 01:8:17,349 --> 01:8:19,440 01:8:17,359 --> 01:8:20,400 material allows you to tell. 01:8:19,430 --> 01:8:20,400 01:8:19,440 --> 01:8:23,199 >> Mhm. 01:8:20,390 --> 01:8:23,199 01:8:20,400 --> 01:8:25,520 >> Not because it was necessarily 01:8:23,189 --> 01:8:25,520 01:8:23,199 --> 01:8:29,040 I had a million choices, I could create 01:8:25,510 --> 01:8:29,040 01:8:25,520 --> 01:8:31,759 a million choices. Um, and with a film, 01:8:29,030 --> 01:8:31,759 01:8:29,040 --> 01:8:34,560 you can suddenly go different play. You 01:8:31,749 --> 01:8:34,560 01:8:31,759 --> 01:8:36,239 create dialogue. You know, even some a 01:8:34,550 --> 01:8:36,239 01:8:34,560 --> 01:8:37,759 film that is, you know, I've been very 01:8:36,229 --> 01:8:37,759 01:8:36,239 --> 01:8:40,000 lucky to work with directors who are, 01:8:37,749 --> 01:8:40,000 01:8:37,759 --> 01:8:42,080 you know, concerned about facticity and 01:8:39,990 --> 01:8:42,080 01:8:40,000 --> 01:8:43,679 and the truth, but nonetheless, they're 01:8:42,070 --> 01:8:43,679 01:8:42,080 --> 01:8:45,279 going to have people play them and 01:8:43,669 --> 01:8:45,279 01:8:43,679 --> 01:8:49,359 there's going to be bits of dialogue. 01:8:45,269 --> 01:8:49,359 01:8:45,279 --> 01:8:53,679 And so, um, you are more hamstrung. Um, 01:8:49,349 --> 01:8:53,679 01:8:49,359 --> 01:8:58,239 and so the puzzle is how can I best tell 01:8:53,669 --> 01:8:58,239 01:8:53,679 --> 01:8:58,640 this material based on being handcuffed? 01:8:58,229 --> 01:8:58,640 01:8:58,239 --> 01:9:1,759 01:8:58,630 --> 01:9:1,759 01:8:58,640 --> 01:9:3,839 >> Uh, and and and the decisions you make 01:9:1,749 --> 01:9:3,839 01:9:1,759 --> 01:9:6,640 are determined by the underlying 01:9:3,829 --> 01:9:6,640 01:9:3,839 --> 01:9:8,159 material. And sometimes that is not 01:9:6,630 --> 01:9:8,159 01:9:6,640 --> 01:9:10,239 always 01:9:8,149 --> 01:9:10,239 01:9:8,159 --> 01:9:12,400 um ideal because sometimes there's 01:9:10,229 --> 01:9:12,400 01:9:10,239 --> 01:9:15,120 somebody you would love to hear in a 01:9:12,390 --> 01:9:15,120 01:9:12,400 --> 01:9:16,960 story but there's no underlying record 01:9:15,110 --> 01:9:16,960 01:9:15,120 --> 01:9:18,400 from them. So you can't tell their 01:9:16,950 --> 01:9:18,400 01:9:16,960 --> 01:9:21,600 01:9:18,390 --> 01:9:21,600 01:9:18,400 --> 01:9:24,239 >> As I've gotten older and I do this more, 01:9:21,590 --> 01:9:24,239 01:9:21,600 --> 01:9:27,359 I try to let the reader know about whose 01:9:24,229 --> 01:9:27,359 01:9:24,239 --> 01:9:29,520 stories maybe aren't told 01:9:27,349 --> 01:9:29,520 01:9:27,359 --> 01:9:31,199 >> but should be, but there's no way to 01:9:29,510 --> 01:9:31,199 01:9:29,520 --> 01:9:34,560 fully tell them so that at least the 01:9:31,189 --> 01:9:34,560 01:9:31,199 --> 01:9:37,199 silences speak. um because those are 01:9:34,550 --> 01:9:37,199 01:9:34,560 --> 01:9:39,679 important too. But um it's just it's a 01:9:37,189 --> 01:9:39,679 01:9:37,199 --> 01:9:41,600 puzzle, you know. I I think history and 01:9:39,669 --> 01:9:41,600 01:9:39,679 --> 01:9:44,880 some it's a puzzle and it's a puzzle 01:9:41,590 --> 01:9:44,880 01:9:41,600 --> 01:9:46,880 based on um h on the research. 01:9:44,870 --> 01:9:46,880 01:9:44,880 --> 01:9:50,920 01:9:46,870 --> 01:9:50,920 01:9:46,880 --> 01:9:50,920 How'd you learn to tell stories? 01:9:51,030 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:9:51,040 --> 01:9:57,199 >> You know, 01:9:52,789 --> 01:9:57,199 01:9:52,799 --> 01:9:59,920 I think the first stories I remember and 01:9:57,189 --> 01:9:59,920 01:9:57,199 --> 01:10:1,920 it's the way I tell stories were from my 01:9:59,910 --> 01:10:1,920 01:9:59,920 --> 01:10:5,520 grandmother. M. >> And so when my grandfather had had a stroke, he would sit on our porch. How old are you at this time? >> Oh, I must have been five, six. Some a young a young boy. Yeah, maybe seven. >> Young, young, maybe even five or six. >> And um and he would sit on our porch. Uh and he had had a stroke, so he couldn't talk much. He couldn't really move much. And I never really knew him. I had no memories of him. My memories are of him kind of just sitting there, not really being able to talk or communicate. And my grandmother would sit there and tell me these stories about him about how he had raced motorcycles and gone down the Kyber Pass and his brakes had failed and he had a little he had one of these motorcycles where there was a little cart next to it and his friend they're saying goodbye to each other and then they see a mound of sand and they roam into the sand and they went flying or how he had fled Russia on foot during the revolution carrying nothing with him and I just I'm looking at this figure and I'm hearing these stories and suddenly I could see my grandfather as a young person running and uh you know risking his life or his life at risk being brought to life. His soul was suddenly I could see it. I could feel it. I could hear it. And she would just weave these stories. And so for me that was the first time I felt the power >> of language. >> You could bring somebody to life and you could see them. And I also understood what stories can do. I got to know my grandfather who I never would have known because of my grandmother because she remembered these stories. She told me these stories. These were not written down stories. These were part of an oral tradition and she shared those stories with me. And I think that was the first time I I I and they were riveting and they helped me. And I'll just tell you a funny story is that when I first started telling stories, I became a reporter and I was a bad reporter. This is in at the Hill in DC. >> Yeah. The Hill newspaper in DC. And I was a bad reporter because I always wanted to tell stories the way my grandmother told me stories. So I would go out, I'd report out a story and I'd write it up and I'd give it to the editor to say, "Yeah, this is good." But we got to take your last graph and we got to move it up to the beginning because the readers got to know what happened. You know, newspapers, they got to know what happened right away. You got to you got to know your second graph. You got to give it away. Hippity hop chop chop. >> Hippity hop. They're not going to read an essay down there. And I was like, "Yeah, but you give it all away." like you can't like who gives the story away at the very end you can't. And so but so I always wanted to tell I didn't know how my grandfather was going to make it out of Russia on foot. I didn't know if he was going to survive the Kyber Pass in his motorcycle. If you put the ending you would ruin the story. So I always kind of told stories almost instinctively the way my grandmother told me stories which I think we all tend to be more instinctive the way we tell stories. >> How important is bigness with a story? And what I mean is like solely birds in the engine, got to land in the Hudson River, saves lives, big story. Twin Towers fall, 9/11, thousands of people die, America changes forever. Big story. But then there's stories I remember for my grandparents telling me it was just like, oh yeah, you know, we're on a walk in Atlanta one time and it was raining and then this happened. And it's like small story, but there's things that small story can capture about the human condition, maybe just cuz they're more relatable or more personable, whatever, that a big story can't tell. Yeah. I I think I never have rules, you know. I think storytelling isn't about, you know, um I think if you're telling a smaller story, there are uh Joseph Mitchell >> who wrote, you know, up in the old hotel, he wrote these wonderful stories about the Bowerery. They're mostly people who just meet in saloons and he would tell their story and they're just exquisite character studies. Now, I will say to pull off that story, >> you have to be one hell of a writer. >> And when you say one hell of a writer, what do you mean? >> Well, you have to be um you have to be both very observant. So, you're doing your reporting, but you don't have some momentous event happening. It's a small accumulation of details. So you have to be able to convey them either. I mean Mitchell wrote with such beauty. I mean he was like a novelist. He wrote with humor and and and and um and his just his choice of language is really I couldn't do that. I can't do that. I'm not capable. I wish I were. I wish I had that power of pros. I don't. I I know I don't. And and so you know partly as a writer you kind of you're always pushing up against your own limitations. At least I am. I am always pushing against my own limitations. Can I push it out just like an inch further? Can I just, you know, you know, can I just get more precise, more clear, have a more musicality in the language, you know, but someone like John uh like Joseph Mitchell, you know, you just it's just it's it's music. You're reading you're reading just a a beautiful piece of music. And there are writers who have that ability. Um most of us don't. Most of us don't. there's a smaller number who have that power. Um, but I think big or large is irrelevant. It's like is there meaning in the story? >> What is the reveal? How do you tell it? And you can do it in a small story. You can do it in a big story. And sometimes in the big stories, it's the smallest moments >> that speak to me or may speak to I'll give you one example. And this is why I do like true stories because I do think that the truth could be more surprising. I mean the more than at least my human mind could ever invent >> on the wager island which depicts the captain and the gunner um in this titanic struggle between two egos, two uh formidable figures battling it out both for power and survival. and one is about to leave the other to likely die on the island. >> And I'm reading the journal and before the captain gets left on the island and the gunner is about to leave him, what do they do? They reach out and they shake hands. And I just thought, "Holy smokes." I never ever I I just never would have thought that would have been the act and that was the act. There was a moment of just and then they will go back to hating each other. But in that moment, they both know what is at stake for each of themselves, how hard it's going to survive, and they basically just wish each other well for one flickering moment. And that is just a small moment of a human act. and you talk about a detail, somebody might read over that detail, right? Because they're not shooting at each other. It's not dramatic, but to me, that small detail tells you something about the human condition. >> Mhm. They just shook hands. Yeah. Hearing you tell that story, it's like I almost reject the premise of what I said that the big stories, you got to look for the small things in the big stories cuz that's what that's what makes it come alive, you know? Like even with uh September 11th, I always think of the guy whispering in George Bush's ear, the famous photo when he's at the school in Florida, right? Like that's a small story inside of a big one. >> And you know, you just talk to so many writers and very often they find, you know, even with 911, they'll be like, "Oh yeah, I wrote about the janitor in the Twin Towers." And just >> by following the janitor, I revealed something about this giant story. Well, the tr and the truth is now that I even think more about your question is that almost all the people I I tend to write about are not I don't really write about prime ministers or dictators or even necessarily uh you know uh you know the people leading a nation um would have their own lives in particular and specificity even in the big stories. moments of history let's call them when you are sweat these are almost always just people you know people with families or not families desires dreams foibless I mean one of the thing that interested me with the wager was just learning about each one of these people who get put on the ship through kind of destiny >> and they're going to be caught up in these events but you know one's you know once they're they're all burdened by their own story when they get on that ship and that story may have been a girlfriend they're leaving behind or someone who spurned them or you know uh creditors who are chasing them or you know so or ambitions and so you know the truth is humans live inside of big stories and and with all their particularities um and so I think uh in a way if you're one of the most I think some of the most interesting stories are told from the bottom up >> like ordinary people starting there. >> Yeah. Just start or just people or you know you just who are these people and and and because they're all caught up in sometimes people get caught up in in momentous events. You know my favorite um my favorite uh Hitchcock I mean one of the things I love about Sper is like the ordinary person who kind of accidentally by some quirk of fate suddenly gets caught up in a huge you know espionage ring and they have no expectation. Um, and I always think that um, and I I write a lot about the powers of detection, but some of the my the detectives I like writing the most about are just often not professional detectives, but people are suddenly trying to make sense of their self or their own world. We're all kind of detectives the way we live. Yeah. You seem very driven by this by this quest to make sense of things. That seems to be something that you is core to who you are. Yeah, I think the world is a very chaotic place. There is a lot of disorder. Uh there's a lot of confusion. >> There's lies. There's red herrings. >> There's red herrings. >> Um there's instability. There's emotion. Um and so I just speak for myself. I write to make sense of the world, to make sense of my own world. I I just and somehow the the the the element of putting words together, finding the facts and kind of putting together is my little way of trying to make sense of something. As you're telling a story, are you deliberate about themes? Love, loss, grief, hope. Like are you deliberate about these are the pivot points that this story is going to orbit around or are you just like no those things just sort of emerge and this is David why I look for those deeper that sort of deeper aboutness that this story is about because then if I have that broader significance whether to life or society culture whatever then those things just emerge. So I'll say um I think I never come to a story with what it is about. >> Now is that in the research process or in the writing process? >> By the writing process, I hopefully know what it's about. >> Okay. >> So in the research when I discover a story and I begin research, most of these I've never heard of. I don't know anything about them. So I have almost no priors. I mean I couldn't know what the themes are. I don't even know what they are. I don't know who the people are. I don't know what happened. And so part of the puzzle is learning what a story is about. Sometimes I might have a, you know, you start to have a preconceived notion or you start the story, you think, oh, well, this is what it's about. But then you do more research and you're like, oh, no, no, it's not about that. And and you always have to be open. I I'll give you an example in um Killers of the Flower Moon. So there's very little I had found written about it, but the bits I found written tended to be about how there was this kind of singular evil figure who had committed these crimes with a few henchmen because that was the story that the FBI that had investigated the cases had concluded and that kind of got passed down. And then gradually as I spoke to Mororrow Sage and uncovered documents, I began to realize that there were all these other killings and they were no lot and they were not connected uh to this singular evil figure and that this was really less a story about who did it than who didn't do it. And it was about a culture of killing. And I remember when that finally dawned on me, I was just like, whoa, wait a second. The book I thought I was writing for two years. I had been working on at that point for two years. It just got demolished and I have to write another book. I have to write a book that this is what it is about. It is about this much deeper and darker conspiracy. And at first I took me a while because I had been you know your your human mind is just kind of organized your research around this concept. And then that got shattered. I was like okay okay all right get my bearings. What is this story about? and and now start to move it in that direction. So the themes grow out of the material. You want to be aware of them. You don't want to be blind to them. You need to discern them. Um but you have to kind of come to them through the material itself. >> Yeah, you can come on how I write whenever you want. [laughter] >> This is so fun. >> Thank you so much. >> Thank you for coming on. It was a pleasure. Thank you, man. Yeah. Thank
