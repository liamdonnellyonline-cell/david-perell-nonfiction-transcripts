for everyone who is here thank you for being here Nick and I are both gonna be presenting for you beginning at the top of the hour Nick's gonna go first he'll present for 20 25 minutes and he's gonna be talking about his writing process and the dude has written 184 weeks in a row and has never missed a week which is just an amazing achievement when it comes to just putting in the reps and we're gonna talk about that and then after Nick talks about his process I have spent so many hours of my life grilling Nick on how he's done this and just asking him question after question after question and so I probably am more familiar with Nick's rise to success than any other writer online and so I have a presentation about Nick's story and how I factor into that and then Nick is actually gonna walk through the different checkpoints and we're gonna start where you might be feeling hey I have a loud screaming voice that I really want to get out into the world and I want to start writing but I don't know how and I'm scared that I'm gonna post online and no one's gonna read my stuff and I'm also scared that I'm gonna post online and everyone's gonna judge me and you're scared of both of those things even though they both can't be true that no one's gonna read your stuff and everyone's gonna judge you but that's how we feel as new writers and then for some of you you might now have some traction you might have posted 20 weeks in a row but maybe you're not growing as fast as you want maybe you are growing fast but you know what you're not really thrilled with what you're writing about so that's what my presentation is really gonna be focused on and basically as I continue here as we go into these introductions if all of you could just look at the bottom of your screen right now you'll see a Q&A you'll see a chat so if you have questions for us on ax who will introduce herself in a second she's gonna be monitoring the QA and towards the end we're gonna spend 30 minutes on that at certain times I'll ask honour to pitch in because she's doing such a good job growing her audience and so she's gonna have certain ideas around how she's been growing hers she's in the early stages and we've been working together and she'll talk about that a little and so if you have questions for us post them in the QA if you just have comments things that are exciting to you post them in the chat so right now let's test the chat and if all of you could write in where in the world you're writing from so I'm from I'm here in San Francisco right now and right now chat Chicago Los Angeles New York Miami Dallas Thank You Tokyo this is always really cool India Saudi Arabia just haven't given the order all cheering right now they're all clapping by the way so I'll throw that out there Sydney Germany Sweden so for all of you who are in Europe thank you for staying up waking up early we really appreciate it this is it's always a blast to see to see so many people on these so what I'm gonna do first before Nick introduces himself I'm gonna ask my team Becca and Anna to introduce themselves so Becca is my assistant she rocks and she is going to be taking notes for all of you so that we can send them to you after the workshop is over Becca why don't you introduce yourself hi everybody I'm Becca I'll be taking the notes so you probably won't hear a whole lot from me through this take a look those will be in your inbox tomorrow I'm just so excited to hear what these guys have to say I'm a musician which right now that's a tough thing to be it's a lot more exciting to be looking at writing so I might steal some of these some of these hints awesome and then Anna why don't you introduce yourself and say where you're from what you're up to and then tell them a little bit about what we're working on as it pertains to summer camp yeah I'm Anna I'm from Panama and I'm a former elementary school teacher now an enterpreneur and I'm kind of doing a deep dive into some of the most challenging questions that we face today in education and that pertain to learning and I met David through write a passage I was an alum I'm a third and fourth cohort and we realized that we share a lot of our views of Education especially how children learn and what we've been doing is just taking everything that we collectively know about what it takes to learn and how to engage kids in creative and with queered we've created a virtual space where kids come from different parts of the world to explore and really develop their ideas in fun and collaborative ways and working projects that they care about so we did a pilot a few weeks ago and then we are launching in June and we're very excited about this and I'm happy to be here I also met Nick through David in New York City a few months ago and how could he see you and I will be monitoring the Q&A so any questions you have that are them in the chat awesome so for all of you who are interested in the work that Anna and I are doing together we adjust through a YouTube video in the chats about 40 minutes long and it dives into how we're thinking about building a summer camp for nine to eleven year olds and trying to just teach little kids how to be creative just like we're teaching adults here how to write and Nick why don't you introduce yourself and then we will get into your presentation everyone I'm Nick majula I'm a data scientist a triple twelfth management and the author behind of dollars in data background from California I live in New York City now kind of it's been kind of crazy quarantine in here I'm on day 64 of the quarantine in case anyone's keeping track so that's about it though but I'm here just gonna talk about my writing process and and that's about it so you want me to get into it David or what yeah yeah Nick why don't you share your screen so as I mentioned I'm gonna interrupt Nick at certain times just to comment on certain things he's saying and we will have some tangential conversations and then I'll encourage Nick to interrupt me as I present but Nick why don't you talk about how you write okay thank you and just let me know if this freezes up David so I can you know go over something again but first off thank you for taking the time to be here I know you guys there's so many other things you can be doing Netflix there's a lot of comp competition for your attention so I'm going to walk you through my writing process quick intro as I said I run up dollars in data I published over 200,000 words online in the last three years and I published about I write about once a week so I'm at 184 posts as of yesterday so each about a thousand words summer longer which is how I got to the 200,000 work figure and lastly I'm getting about 80,000 visitors monthly I was at a 60 but it's kind of went up since coronavirus so that's kind of why that's increased a little bit because people are interested in finance whatnot but before we get into my writing I want to talk about one of these now maybe it's a little kid you guys saw this maybe near a park or something I'm wondering how many you guys know what this is this is an anthill and for those of you that don't know but an anthill leads into an ant nest so within an ant nest there's a bunch of different chambers for example there might be there's a room where the Queen's gonna be you know laying eggs there's gonna be a room where they have extra food there's gonna be a chamber for other things and if I gave you the task of trying to design like the right the right way to build an ant nest there's a bunch of different ways you could go about doing it one way which is very popular is people will find an abandoned ant nest and then fill it with molten aluminum and they will let that molten aluminum cool and then they will chip away the dirt and soil around it and you'll get something that kind of looks a little bit like that see they're tripping away the dirt there and eventually you get one of these this is an ant nest nest cast all right there's one here here's another look here so you could study these things you could you know make thousands of these from all the you know ant nest around the world and come up with a theory of the right way to build an ant nest right you would say okay maybe one of your I you know one of the key points is you know you need a sturdy material needs soil or you need dirt something like that it's gonna work well right next you need to know that location-wise need to be secluded but you also need to be near a food source that's gonna be an important point and lastly you're gonna need to have some sort of good weather you know if it's if it's raining your your nest is gonna flood and so all the ants will die so it's not it's not good to be an area that's really rare so if you were to just kind of come a way to build an an S this is what you might come up with however I would say what about the army ants this is also an ant nest here this thing on the left is big blob do you see right here but this aren't this ant nest is actually made out of bodies and is actually called a bivouac that's how you pronounce this and it's actually kind of cool because they can actually control the temperature and the humidity within this nest and it's all created out of their bodies they're always mobile army ants always moving right and so that's one exception to the rule now what about leaf cutters they build their nests underground but they don't have to care about where they are in terms of food source because they just grab a bunch of leaves and they actually cultivate a fungus which they eat and they are the only other species on the planet outside of humans that grow their own food it's these leafcutter ants right and then what about the Weaver ants they will actually go and take leaves and you can see a bunch of Weaver ants here pulling them together and then they'll put a silk in between to make their nest and I know this is kind of a ridiculous knowledge II Nick why are you tell me about ants who gives a crap but you'll see that there is no right way to build an ant nest you could go about the world study the world come up with one version of reality and then you find all these exceptions that also work and that is exactly true in writing the same thing goes for writing David and I for example are both good writers but we are very different in how we write David his process is completely different than mine doesn't mean that his is right mine's wrong if just saying that there are different ways so that your key thing for you my whole disclaimer over everything I'm about to tell you is find the way that you write I would say experiment with different things try this try that and find the way that works for you because that's the most important thing it's finding your process so with that being said with that disclaimer here is how I write here's my process it's gonna seem very simple but I'll explain as I go along so the first thing and I think the most important part of the funnel with writing is consuming information consuming high-quality information so I spent a lot of time reading with that means reading books reading blog posts reading tweets you know watching shows all sorts of stuff that are helping to feed my brain to help me feed ideas you know I just wrote a post recently and I use something from succession so you can get it from shows not just books and and blog posts and articles and things like that academic articles but you just want to consume a lot of information because that's gonna really allow your brain is really good at making connections and more information you have in there the more you're gonna create these connections that's how I came up with this and now whether you like it or not that's it's trying to create these connections the next part is that you have to think about that information I know that seems really simple but when I talk about thinking I mean really critically thinking because most of our day me included we spend most of our day on autopilot we're just like you know going through the motions of our day it's very rare that even I am spending that much time critically deep thinking I spend most of my day on autopilot so you have to really break out of that habit and say hey wait does that make sense you know and spend that time thinking so I kind of look at this as like a loop you're consuming information and thinking this is happening over and over and over and once in a while you'll be like oh wow that's kind of interesting maybe there's something I can I can write about there and so then you end up right that's the last part yeah yeah I have a question I want to just jump in here with consuming information you wrote a great article about books and the kinds of books and the reasons why books tend to be higher quality sources of information and you talked about the time per word that a given writer would spend to write a book versus a blog post now that doesn't mean that every book is better than every blog post but you talked about books like the power broker by Robert Caro talk about that philosophy of like as you think of what kind of information am I going to consume I mean are you consuming BuzzFeed are you consuming are you just sort of scrolling on Instagram or are you being more deliberate or like maybe going to the third floor of the New York Public Library across the street where from where you work how do you actually think about finding information and sourcing the information that goes into your brain yeah so a lot of that is gonna come through recommendations from people so so in terms of thinking about like you know the why books are generally higher quality than blog posters are generally higher quality than tweets it's just the amount of time that people spend you know if you think and that's I mean just because someone spent a lot of time on something doesn't mean it's necessarily gonna be good but at the same time like the more time that generally authors spend on something and especially if it's been recommended by someone you trust so Dave commends a book I'm gonna read it you know he's like hey you should check this out that's why I spent you know what 30-something hours to read the power broker despite you know it being whatever six hundred thousand words right so I spent all that time because David recommended it and it was a very good book you know the reports of it that I thought were okay this is not necessary but it's still like there's tons of information if you want to understand how you know the inner workings of you know politics and power that's the book to read right and simply you want to think about someone is taking all their time because basically what you're doing when you buy a book is you're getting you're leveraging someone else's time they spent so Robert Caro spent what seven years on power broker and I'm getting that for you know twenty bucks I'm getting like you think about how much and how many hours he spent to put that book together I think I can't I don't the post here I can look it up later I should have this memorized but he's working for like half a cent an hour ten for me like I have the best writer in the world working for me for less than half a cent an hour you know yes Nick here's what you write you say for example the power broker by Robert Caro took seven years to write and can be purchased for twenty three dollars and forty cents on Amazon if you assume he worked full-time while writing it then it would cost you less than one-fifth of the cent per hour of Karos time yeah that's what's crazy a fifth of a cent for literally one of the greatest authors of all time to write you a book right it's it's incredible do you think of it that way books are the most underpriced asset in the world it's not even close so that's kind of when I say consumer information who do you trust like fine either I use Twitter find those networks of people you trust and kind of do that yeah real quick one thing that I found for all of you is I so I was talking to a friend the other day and she's not a big reader and she said oh the public library has all these great books and I said what are the great books and she said it has all the popular ones and I said well I'm not sure that all the popular ones has all the great books and I have a different philosophy on this and I said to her you know I think that the great books and the books that you should always buy our books that your friends and people that you trust strongly recommend that you never heard of or would never find in a bookstore those are the great books that are gonna give you the ideas that other people look at and say whoa this person is really interesting and there's a quote that I've always liked that goes something to the effect of the originality of an idea is directly tied to the obscurity of the sources that that idea comes from and so if you want people to read your writing and to say whoa I've never thought of that idea before you're better off finding books like the lessons of history by Will Durant which you would never find in a bookstore but it's a 115 page compendium of this guy's life work as a historian and if you're just posting and writing about just the popular books the ones that you find one through ten on the New York Times bestseller list I'm not saying that those books are worthless but I'm saying that if you're only reading those books if you're only reading Washington Post New York Times USA Today you're going to be getting the same information and working from the same Lego blocks as everybody else yeah that's a good point you kind of want it you want to have a little diversify your information streams in some way as well just to see what else is out there okay so continue on this talk as I said I consume information thinked and right I would say I spent about 80% of my time in this part and only 20% of my time writing so though we talked about the 80% a lot Dave and I just did it we're now gonna talk about the 20% so what does it actually look like this is inside my WordPress right now these are what I call my thoughts on hold these are just a bunch of drafts I'll go through this quickly for example this one here snakey eats its tail that's about feedback loops this one is about nature versus nurture this one's about net worth implementation this is actually coming out tomorrow but this is just kind of how am I you know I organize my thoughts and then even within one of these drafts you'll see that I might put like ideas in here kind of organize my notes okay hey I need to get this Michelle Obama quo I need to get this Jack Bogle quo here's this DB research car I need a personal story from college about this so organize things like that and then I will start writing and so when I start writing the goal is to what I call reduce friction so when I'm writing my process is a lot of people say oh you write everything out at once and then go back and edit I don't do that I started the very beginning I try to get it perfect and then I go to the next sense and try to get that perfect and go on so when I say friction what I mean by friction is when the reader notices the writing instead of the message it's supposed to convey that's how you know you have high friction writing and high friction is bad now let me give you an example I don't really like having a lot of text on slides but these next two slides will have a lot of text and I'll explain why here's a high friction example I'm going to read through this right now this is some writing I found online the most confusing part of the mobile transformation of shopping is that as people are more urban and otherwise I said they still need tribal fields even when we're competing for attention in real life in digital worlds we need to link arms of social strategies to avoid real or perceived conflicts or her status as a proxy for food in territory so if we don't want to shop all the time used to be one experiences this I've read this a lot and it's it's very difficult to get through there's friction like what's going on linking arms with social strategies there's all these pieces in here that I have to kind of rethink what is this person trying to say the message isn't perfectly clear to me maybe it is for you but for me it's really tough to figure out what this person's saying and let me contrast this with a post that I wrote that I spent a lot of time I probably spent three hours on the next couple of sentences you're gonna see you're saying Nick you spend so much time on it well this posted really well and before it did well I'm saying I spend a lot of times I really wanted this idea to be clear I really wanted to kind of really wow people from the beginning so now here's what I call a low-friction example which I'm hoping you find it's much easier to understand and follow so I will now read this in the late 1970s the view in the publishing world was that an author should never produce more than one book a year the thinking was that publishing more than one book a year would dilute the brand name of the author however this was a bit of a problem for Stephen King who was writing books at a rate of two per year instead of slowing down King decided to publish his additional works under the pen name of Richard Bachman over the next few years every book King published sold millions well Richard Bachman remained relatively unknown King was a legend Bachman and nobody now why I think this has low-friction is because the idea are just logically connected in a very simple logical flow so I'm now gonna add just literal color in here into the main ideas that are in this in these three paragraphs so in red here we have this I call the viewer the thinking or the status quo and publishing so I say there's this view in the publishing world and then the next sense I say the thinking and then here I say however this was a problem like there's this this is the first idea this status quo in publishing and then the second idea which is the next logical piece which we're gonna jump to which is Stephen King I just say an author author and then I eventually it's revealed that the author is Stephen King right and then by this sentence here instead of slowing down I've abandoned the first idea it's gone we don't need to think about it anymore and now I'm introducing a new idea Richard Bachman so you can see there's idea one in red idea two in blue idea three in green you can see this kind of like logical volley that's going on so if I had to simplify this entire three paragraphs into like just bullet points it would be this there's a status quo in publishing Stephen King is not okay with that status quo so he creates Richard Bachman right that's it that red blue green that's exactly what your brain is doing when you're coming through this you don't realize it but your brain is just it's just flowing right through following the logic as it reads compared to something worth it's much harder to follow the logic so as I said you followed this logic through kraits Bachmann and then the last point which this is what the whole post is about being a successful by Bachmann is it but you're in your mind you know Bachmann is keen are the same person house as possible this post was called why winners keep winning and it's really about how talents it not all talented people become successful and this is it shows that sometimes there's just a lot of luck involved and that's what happens but the main point here when I talk about low-friction is that logical flow should go unnoticed if you're doing if you're putting out good writing people should just be reading it and it should just flow there should be no friction as I thought that's the only word I have for maybe think someone else is called it something else but I call it you know no friction it goes on notice and this comes to another piece of philosophy which is good writing is like good design you shouldn't notice it now what do I mean by that look at this door handle without me even saying anything if you were walking through this door you already know you need to push this door to go it's obvious you don't have to think about it you would walk through it without even spending a second of your time to understand what's going on but we've all been to a door handle where you had to pour you pulled in you actually needed to push that's bad design you don't want that that's like something like this this is not what you want if you see a pole and there's something this is clearly a push this is bad this is what bad writing feels like this right here this is what you're doing to your reader don't do this right that's my whole thing make the writing just clear don't try and be fancy don't get to use big words just make it clear that's far more important get rid of the friction right and last thing I want to say the last thing is the last point and then we'll wrap up here is that the traditional writing of ice we get in school is is very bad because it doesn't focus on what's important in writing this is us right here how to be a good writer have an introductory paragraph make sure you use who versus whom correctly don't end your sentence in a preposition and this is us we're this scared little dog and then we leave high school or college or whatever and we go out into the world and have to write because we're taught that this is what matters but none of this matters this is wrong you know grammar style structure none of that matters right you know what really matters entertain your reader or inform your reader or do both this is what really matters you know and how do I want proof of this go to Reddit right now you'll find people getting uploaded to have no grammar no style no structure whatsoever they're not even using periods they're not using punctuation whatever and they can entertain you they can inform you you will find stuff like that all the time and then you read an academic paper that follows the Chicago Manual of style down to the T and you don't want to read it this is what's going on it's because people think this is good writing this is not good writing good writing entertains and informs that's it do one or the other you either want to entertain them or inform them ideally people so last cent last slide here this is basically I'm just summarizing everything I've said kept this really short consume high quality information spend time thinking about that information this is the hardest part no one wants to do this even I don't do this I find myself procrastinating all the time I don't want to critically think about this why my logical arguments not making sense why this post isn't coming together right but that's the second part and then you tell stories you know you stories you analogies I mean some these analogies may have hit for you some maybe did it but I'm risking it you have to take the risk with the story you have to make these crazy connections that's how you come up with model things that can impress people sometimes like oh wow that was kind of cool you know so you got to kind of go out there tell stories of logical flow keep it low friction and lastly your goal is to inform them that's why you're writing to them or entertain them or do both and lastly the most important point which is why we talked about the ants there is no right process so find something that works for you so David you have anything you want to say about that I kind of went through that quickly I know we're kind of you know a little strapped for time so I don't wanna know that was fantastic I have a couple questions so if you want to stop sharing your screen and we can just we can just chat the first question that I have for you is you and I have spent hours talking about stories at the beginning of articles and I know that's something that you've worked a lot on where I remember one time you even said to me I have idea articles and I have story articles that I have either the idea ready or the story ready and when I have the idea ready I need to find the story for that idea and when I have the story ready I need to find the idea for that story talk about that and do have like a way of collecting stories and where have you taken inspiration from with stories and how do you think about this so it varies I've more recently I've done a little bit less of the story type writing because that's kind of like to be honest it's kind of like just doing what Morgan Housel does very well I mean I could I could do it you know decently okay doing that type of methodology of always starting with a story but I don't like always starting with a story because at some point I just kind of got tired of doing it because it's it's tough it's tough to find a good story like oh this analogy fits perfectly for this idea it's always it's tough to do that it's hard to find something that always works you know so I'm saying it's that's me not doing my critical thinking I'm procrastinating to be honest so but how do you do it you Scott I like read a lot as I said read a lot of stuff write down stories I use candle I highlight a lot that helps so if you have something highlighted you're like hey you know this is really useful and then you come back to it later I find that that's incredibly helpful for me and then additionally with if I get an idea I'm like wow that ideas really cool like I just need to find a story so I'll then start looking through a bunch of old stories I have in different books I use but that's kind of it I just kind of try and just have a collection of stories clutch from ideas and maybe one day they kind of intersect or one day it just clicks like oh my gosh that's it you know but it takes time you got to keep consuming information and keep thinking about it you work in the hub for financial blogging what have you learned from spending as much time as you do with Josh Brown and Barry Ritholtz Michael bat Nick what if you learn about watching them and what allows them to be so prolific everyone's different everyone doesn't so differently like Josh will go and he will literally sit at the computer and just hammer it out like that like I don't do that I mean I that can sometimes happen but I'm never like oh this is it usually I've been thinking about this idea for maybe months sweets maybe Josh has too but he will literally sit down and then just rant this whole thing out and then like he just does it right there just stream-of-consciousness it might take him like an hour two hour not even that long right he'll just put it on there and get it out me it would take me you know you know six to 10 hours of thinking and writing and doing all this stuff I'm more like a Beethoven I'm trying to perfect it versus he's more like a Mozart he just has it right it's just there right so I'm like at war with myself he's not so it's cool to see that I think Michael bannocks also like that as well he just can just write it out you know he very rarely he's just like there with it and so that's kind of interesting but as I said like I'm not that I can't do that yeah maybe when I'm older and I've had more years doing this I can just oh this is just like this and put it out there but that's not me yet I have to think a lot deeper about what I want to do and kind of figure out the arguments and they can just do it much more just flowing right I think that's kind of the big thing I think it's all she's ever seen speaking writing you know that's why I feel like I'm a very good writer but just when I come up and add you know if I to go and you start asking me you know rapid-fire questions on things I'm not really prepared for I'm not gonna sound that eloquent compared to my writing where it had you know hours and hours and hours to think about this and oh here's what this is wrong here this is right and massaging the argument all that type of stuff so I think that's the difference because he speaks also he has to think like yes you ready to go right away yeah yeah yes speaking really makes you so much more eloquent I once asked when I got to interview Neil deGrasse Tyson I asked him why he was such an eloquent speaker like what is your secret and he said I almost never say anything in public that I haven't written down before dad there you go great great advice crazy just crazy and I mean that like that shows how much I think that here were just to put a stop on this it shows how much first of all of writing happens away from the computer and like when I teach my writing students and write a passage this is a lot of what we talked about that most of writing happens away from the computer writing isn't really this process of sitting looking at a blank write white page and just typing writing as you said like 80% of it happens away from the page and information consumption and thinking and then I would also add talking cuz you and I spend a lot of time at dinner like when we go out to dinner you and I talked a lot about what ideas are you thinking of how we gonna frame this I'm not so sure that you should frame it that way hey David you need a better intro story and I remember even when I wrote what the hell is going on you I had that my introduction buried within the piece and you said bring that right to the top and I think that's part of the reason why that essay did well and what you're saying here and a lot of what I agree with is that writing really is more that Josh Brown method where you're doing all this stuff in your life so the time by the time you sit down at your computer you're just ready to rock ready to fire so I'm gonna present now and Nick please interrupt me when you have something too something to add and will do so I'm gonna start off talking about this idea of pushing and pulling so I think that a lot of the times you know when we think about let's pretend we're getting a job what we do is we we push our ideas out there listen to me listen to me what do we do we shout we take our megaphone and we just throw a lot of information out into the world and we just hope that somebody's gonna listen you know this is the canonical like whenever I have people submit JA applications I'm astounded at the percentage of job applications which are horribly written like people very clearly don't put in the time and they just expect that if they put out a hundred applications ten percent are going to respond three percent will then become job offers something like that and that really isn't how writing online works that's not really the the benefit writing online is much more of a pull strategy and I always say you want to become a lighthouse for like-minded people and I love that idea and what it means is that you're putting ideas out into the world so a Knicks case he's talking about dollars which is money and data and he's doing it through the vehicle of writing and so we're gonna talk about this in a little while but what ends up happening is Nick's not attracting people who are auditioning for Cirque du Soleil Nick's not attracting people who are part of the Houston Astros pitching Coache team Nick's not attracting people who are musicians at Carnegie Carnegie Hall he's attracting people who are in the finance industry who are asset managers they might run hedge funds they're riders those are the people who he's attracting and what you realize when you put stuff out online is you realize that the world is so big but what the Internet is is it's the world's best matching tool even though the internet is so big the Internet is so good at making the world small and matching you with the perfect person it's like tinder for ideas if tinder actually worked so I want to talk about Nick's story and in 2016 Nick was in Boston and he was working for litigation consulting firm and Nick you want to tell this part of the story I mean you can do it better than I can yeah sure so I was working for litigation consulting firm and I kind of wanted to like I'd always wanted to possibly start like a finance blog or something and I was like I've always had these ideas you know but I never got around to doing I said when should I do it I was kind of maybe I should start this side hustle thing whatever you know is like how would I do it and I finally just said you know what I'm gonna do it it was New Year's New Year's Eve 20 going into 2017 so late 2016 I said you know what I'm gonna do it I'm just gonna do this I'm gonna write one post a week and I'm gonna have all my code published online for anyone to see so that was like a big thing for me because then I could actually organize my data and my code just like how I did my cases at the firm I was out at the time at that litigation consulting firm so it was really more like making my own case really and every week was like a different analysis for the case so I was kind of using what I knew and applying that to start writing so that was kind of a big thing for me so Nick was where a lot of you might be right now where he was working for this firm he didn't love what he was doing saw that he could make a career transition saw a brighter future for himself but when he looked up at his future there was sort of like this ceiling like he wasn't quite able to to make the jump so he saw that there was a whole world above above the roof but he looked up and that steel was above him not letting him rise up and on January 1st 2017 for a New Year's resolution Nick decided to start writing every single day and that's exactly what he did his first post was called why hedge funds get rich where he told the story about how they collect fees and over time they become wealthier and wealthier and over like 20 years they become wealthier than than their clients and through those fees that's how they get wealthy and Nick was so excited to start writing boom-boom-boom this might be how you feel and he started and crickets he was in what I call the four months of quiet and he published 16 posts 16 posts before his first post that went well just keep buying finally caught but in that quiet moment when he went X X X X X people weren't reading when he was saying when he was getting X after X he kept writing and he didn't miss a single week so he publishes that the article and Nick why don't you talk about what happened say I just keep buying was probably the first article that kind of went like I don't want it's not viral because I mean by I mean everything virals relative but I'm saying viral relative to what I was getting it was like huge it was like the biggest post I'd put out you know I can't don't have the numbers now I bet I could look back and try and find some of that data but was on medium at the time but like it just was like crazy all these people like wow this is so good all this stuff and it was just really crazy to kind of see that happen and that's when I kind of knew like okay I think I can do this if I can just keep coming out with good stuff like this so Nick publishes just keep buying and he's saying right he's optimistic but then after his first four months of quiet he gets back into the return to quiet and he just keeps writing and he's focused and what he did was Saturdays and Sundays he would write write write and this is one of the things that is most annoying about being friends with Nick is that I can't hang out with him on Sundays because I get texts like this he texts me so kindly a man haven't heard of you in a while and then I tell you around Sunday and it goes yeah might might be around that but maybe busy it's my writing day so get lost David but I should be able to do Saturday night and this is a lot of my conversations with Nick Nick has his writing day where he's not willing to work in a coffee shop and sort of hang out and kind of you know talk and write know Nick is in his apartment he sits at his desk and he works every single Sunday and so even when friends are texting him he's making a sacrifice to say you know what I am NOT ready to start going and even now as I look at this and I'll get back into Nick's story well this is what his track record looks like it looks a lot like this where by the time that Nick got his first job offer from writing you can see he hadn't missed a single week not one and what he had done was he had become a lighthouse for like-minded people so what does that mean well towards the end of 2017 remember Nick had started writing at the beginning of 2017 so this was 10 11 months later Nick flew down to New York for a conference and he was at this conference and there he met Michael bat Nick and Nick do you want to tell the story of how you looked up to Michael bat Nick and and and what ended up happening from there yes so it was kind of crazy so actually yeah when I first saw them it was actually like the night before there was like some bar we were gonna go like everyone's going to so I go in there and I see Michael like hey I I'm like hey I'm Nick Miceli and he didn't know quite he was like I'm sorry who was i run-up dollars and and he's like oh I've read your where he didn't realize cuz I I forgot at the time I was still anonymous that's another thing I don't talk about the story I was actually so afraid of like putting my ideas out there I was an anonymous profile I wasn't even Nick majula like I was of dollars in data like so as soon as I said of dollars in data he knew who I was but before that like I just I was so disconnected I forgot oh he doesn't even know because I'm anonymous so silly right but anyways at some point I became non anonymous but still it was so cool meeting him and like chatting and you know you know game to talk with him and stuff and I was like hey you know do you guys hiring someone in finance what do you guys need and then eventually from there we got into talks related to my date not necessarily my writing but more my data working the stuff I did which I was able to showcase on the blog and that's kind of how I went to through the next process with them so then and and and I want to show this to you there are two examples here because I want to show you just how often this happens in my life so I have an example here with Nick and an example with my friend tau so you'll see on the Left I diem Nick and I say hey man love your writing are you in New York a lot he said thank you I appreciate it love the piece you and Connor put out recently will tweet it out soon and this was the first interaction that Nick and I ever had and he said yeah I'm not New York too often and then you'll see at the bottom he messages me and he says hey good news I'm moving to New York City in April we'll probably live in Murray Hill or southern Manhattan I can fill you in on details later but I think I really look forward to to meeting you so Nick and I ended up getting dinner at wagamama and you'll see on the right like this is one of my messages with my friend tall where I'm just reaching out to people on Twitter and I'm saying hey let's chat let's let's do direct messages and this is for me how I meet a lot of my friends but exactly what happened with Nick and I so we meet up at Wagamama we start talking and Nick then moves down to New York because on June 1st 2018 he starts a job down here Nick is there anything you want to add and you want to talk about how you got from meeting Michael to actually starting that first job uh so yeah I basically met with them we went back and forth and it's actually kind of funny while I was talking with Michael another firm in the New York City area actually someone slid into my DMS and was like hey be working finance or would you work in finance and I said yeah but I'm talking to this other firm he's like oh we're good friends like we'll work this out so basically because they knew each other to Twitter and they were really close I basically did a two-month internship before June 1st so from April remember I was in New York City in April so for April in May I was working somewhere else and then I then I joined Ritholtz in June but it was just all that came through Twitter all that was through Twitter everyone knowing everyone and I didn't even have to interview at that firm where I did the two-month internship like because Michael and riddles embedded me like they just said okay we trust them so much that like you can come work for us like it was like I'd have to send a resume either like I didn't have to do any of that stuff that the normal recruiting process required like it was just all like because I had put on my ideas enough and they kind of trusted my thinking process I guess so that was kind of cool yeah absolutely I mean this was like the side door for you you know there's a great book from a quote or there's a quote from a great book called the third door and the the book begins and it goes life business success it's just like a nightclub and at a nightclub there's there's there's three ways to get into a nightclub most people wait in the long line right where you get into that front door and whenever you walk past the nightclub you see all those people standing there and that's sort of where resume is like and then there's a second door which is everyone knows about the store it's sort of friends of the business sort of friends of the nightclub and you can walk right around and you can get through this sort of the VIP section but what I always say that writing online is is it's the third door it is the door that nobody knows about all the way in the back where there's no line you skip past everybody and you get right in and I think that next story is that third door story applied to writing and so I want to ask what can we learn from Nick and there are a couple things that I would focus on and the first is what I call a personal monopoly and his personal monopoly is right in the name of the website it is of dollars and data and so what Nick did when he was sitting in Boston scratching his head saying what am I gonna do with my writing I really want to do this but I'm not entirely sure what I want to focus on he said okay I'm gonna start with dollars I'm gonna say we're gonna start with focusing on investing then I have that's my interest that's what I want to learn about then I have this skill in the software program called R so I'm going to ladder that in to data so now what I have is I have investing and data so I have two sets of interests one overlap there but I need a way to actually communicate that and for him it was writing so what Nick did was he said I'm gonna focus on dollars and data through the vehicle of writing but what's really important is Nick stayed inside of what I call his personal Monopoly box and what a personal Monopoly box is is it is inside that Venn diagram you have unlimited freedom you get to do whatever you want you can write about travel you can write about movies you can write about food whatever it is but it should somehow cross the intersection of those three things and when you're first start writing you're like oh my goodness this is gonna be so constraining but once you actually stay in out of it you realize that this box is way bigger than you thought it's not a two dimensional box it's like a three dimensional box that can expand as the world changes and it's almost like a gas and how it flows that whenever the world is changing when things get tough when things get easy when the stock market Rises when the stock market Falls it begins to change and depending on what's happening in the world depending on what you're interested in depending on what you're doing that personal monopoly box can look different to you but what's really important is Nick stayed inside his personal Monopoly box but that isn't enough it wasn't enough that he just stayed inside of it he also followed the Seinfeld strategy and what the Seinfeld strategy is as it comes from Jerry Seinfeld you know the famous comedian behind the show you guessed it Seinfeld and one time he was at a comedy club and he's standing there and you know he's he's totally ready this is his thing this is what he does well and a young comic all nervous and stuff goes up to him like Nick probably went up to Michael Batna and he said ah question for you i mr. mr. Seinfeld any tips for a young comic his name is Brad Isaac and Seinfeld looked at him and he he sat back like this and he he started thinking and he responded and he said he said the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes was to write every day he told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole gear on one page and hang it on a prominent wall the next step was to get a big red magic marker he said for each day that I do my task of writing I get to put a big red X over that day after a few days you'll have a chain you'll keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day you'll like seeing that chain especially when you get a few weeks under your belt your only job is to not break the chain so what Nick did was he didn't break the chain he kept on going and what happened was he began to build an audience and so yes his writing got better but then his voice grew louder and louder so even though some articles were successes and some were failures and over time more of them became successes fewer of them became failures he began to write on top of the stadium of people and that stadium of people were people on his email list people who signed up for every single Tuesday morning I wake up and I'm telling you I have a 100 percent open rate on Nick's email newsletter I do not miss a single day there we go I'm telling you man I've never not opened one me and thousands of other people so even though some are getting better and some are succeeding some aren't nick is on a pulpit and there's a whole stadium of people listening to him and went Nick did was he focused on reps reps reps so now on that I have a story for you because I was reminded as I was making this of my experience focusing on reps reps reps so I'll be honest when I was a kid I was really scrawny and I had no muscle and it was awful because I was really skinny and I was short so I was always bullied and I never liked it and when I was in college I went to a college called Elan and I was like you know what I'm done with this I'm done with this and I had a friend whose name was Jamie Daphna and Jamie Daphna loved to work out and so Jamie used to drag me to the gym every single day and he was the kind of guy who would bench press so much that like his waist would come off the bench press like dude you're putting up a lot of weight but you are going to destroy your back if you keep doing this but no matter what he dragged me to the gym and the rule that I made was I had to go to the gym every single day no matter what but I could only go for 30 minutes and the second that the 30 minute timer went off I could leave that's all I needed to do in fact I needed to leave and I made another deal with myself if I put on my shoes put on my shorts put on my shirt walk to the gym and still didn't feel like working out I could leave immediately but I never ever ever missed a single day at the gym and I had my Seinfeld strategy X's I would just go and now I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger I'm just kidding but this is exactly what this is exactly what Arnold did and he has this great quote that I think I learned from from Nick where he says there are no shortcuts everything is reps reps reps so what I did was I created all of these dots and I wanted to see what a hundred eighty four reps look like Nick has never missed a single week not one and this is what it looks like look at all of those X's actually I'm just kidding that's only half of them this is what it looks like I actually made this three times because I had to make the dots so small because Nick has written so many articles and that I had to copy and paste a hundred eighty four X's so I learned first hand what doing this is like and this is what Nick was able to do and so I think that if we're able to just step out and say Nick what is the key beyond you know we see this a hundred and eighty four successful weeks I think its strategy and its reps so what Nick did was he had his personal monopoly where he focused on dollars data and writing and then he put in the reps and then because of that he didn't have to shout into the world to advance and accelerate his career to make friends to meet all these cool people who are also interested in the same ideas as him what he was able to do was people so that is the kind of thing that we talked about rite of passage which is my writing course which you might be interested in and Nick has been a huge inspiration for that so thanks Nick now we can move on to the QA but I'm curious to hear what kinds of comments do you have next video may have frozen but this for all of you this would be a good time to this would be a good time to start sharing in the in the QA onna actually this would be a good time for you to talk about how your personal monopoly is developing because I think that you know this is something that you and I are talking a lot about basically on and I cuz we're working on summer camp we're trying to figure these things out together so honor why don't you share just how you feel right now because I think that a lot of people with will relate with what you're what you're going through yeah so I had a lot that I wanted to be to share before I joined write a passage but I just wasn't really sure how I wanted to do that or how I wanted to approach that again I'm used to work at a school and I attended actually to 10 different schools when I was growing up and I worked at seven different schools so and in school what they teach you is well you really need to be careful about the things that you're sharing and how you share it and it has to go through a filter and it's usually through the teachers so you know I I finally left school last year and I had all this ideas and I was questioning all these things and highlight you know I wanted to highlight common knowledge in education in a way that would start to provoke like the larger rumination about this important issues and matters and when I took rite of passage it kind of inspired me and it showed me different ways in which I could like really start sharing all this content and it helped me nail down what it is that I wanted to focus on and my voice and the way that I wanted to do it and how do we built that audience and that was November last year and you know by January this year I already started building that audience I had people reaching out and saying that the things that I was saying resonate with them and the way that I was saying it so really it's been you know now it's May and and it's incredible all the things that have happened and all the people that I've gotten to know and talked to and all the ideas that are going around because of this and because of nailing that no monopolies and now what David is really helping me as to what we've been talking about you know really put in those reps and make sure that we're publishing constantly and putting our thoughts out there which is not easy right because again we've been trained not really to do this in school and school it's kind of like it stays in the classroom so so yeah that's that's what I'm working on now and I've seen wonderful results so far yeah so I mean just to give you an idea of like what Anna and I are trying to figure out and I think a lot of you are trying to figure this stuff out is like we're just trying to see reps looks different for every individual person right you have people like Michael Lewis who they published book after book that's not going to be me then you have people like me I publish essay after essay and ahna was saying wait it's hard for me to get my writing in these really long organized essays I need something different so now what we're trying to figure out is like can Anna publish something very small like a hundred two hundred words every single day and so I think that for all of you one thing that I would strongly recommend having taught hundreds of people to write focus on what is the reps that work for me and make sure that whatever that calendar that you have is that you stick to it so that you get those green stars like Nick on anything else to say to that no that's exactly it you know really find what's that what's about the best way for you to publish those ideas and put the content out there because that's really what we should all be doing right now and it's just a matter of finding your voice and and your crowd and the best way that works for you in order to do that so yeah absolutely so I'm going to answer some questions in the chat and on it if you could just moderate and let me know which ones are the best ones I know that you were talking Nick question for you what how do you decide what to read in the consume information part so let's focus a little bit deeper on on that idea and how we choose what to read so you do tend to prefer books to articles you vote you follow people on Twitter what else do you do to find really high quality information I just like a lot of it's from Twitter just people recommending books especially stuff that's just seems and I'm like one of the best books I ever read was called the ends of the world and it's about this is these five periods in history when like there was mass extinctions like you know that you guys have all heard the dinosaur asteroid one that one there's actually theories about whether it was an asteroid was aspirated multi think things that happened after the volcanic they think is aspirin that caused volcanic activity so anyways there's all these mass extinctions through history and it was just like super interesting like one of those interesting things I've ever learned and it's also about climate and I'm really really intuitive investing kind of thing of like drawdowns and you kind of connect in different ways but it's like reading about just interesting different stuff that's really cool like I just try to find books that people recommend I use Amazon reviews I use people I kind of use a little bit of everything it's like uh you know recommendations plus plus Amazon will it gets me most of it what was that intro that you have like dinosaurs didn't exist or something there was that there was someone uh George Washington or what I guess when George Washington died he didn't know about dinosaurs like dinosaurs he didn't know about that dinosaurs existed right so crazy like George Washington was more likely to believe in Giants than dinosaurs like that just seems kind of ridiculous you know but like dinosaurs are a very recent invention we've only known about them for the last couple hundred years so that's what's kind of interesting yeah one of the things for for all of you that I would strongly recommend when it comes to consuming information so one of the things that I think a lot about and I haven't heard any other writing teacher mention anything close to this and it is this works very well for me take a lot of notes so that you don't have to do research and what I mean by that is when we write in school we sit down on the first day of class and the teacher says and I'm gonna parody this a little but the general point stands true the teacher says you have an essay due in three months at the end of the semester spend between now and then researching for that essay you are gonna write about something that you do not know about and generally that isn't how you want to be writing what is better to be doing is to write about ideas where the whole idea is already kind of in your notes and in your head and what I have is just a big note-taking system and then when I read it is always in purpose of something so that I'm focusing on something so for example next week my whole week is devoted to redoing the rite of passage right in curriculum so I am just flying through different writing books and that's actually why I've been tweeting so much about writing what I'm trying to do is put the main ideas out into the world and then watch how people interact and respond to them so that I can get feedback before I make it a concrete part of my curriculum and what I'm doing is I'm probably flipping between four to six writing books right now and I'll be honest none of them are good not a single one is good and I'm reading like the best writing books ever written and I'm disappointed in all of them and some of them are just absolute trash and I'm trying to just figure out what is the difference between what makes something good and not good and for me like I don't know what a preposition is I don't know what a Clauses I don't know what the passive voice is like I literally have no idea and even as a writing teacher I'm not interested in learning like it's just not how my brain works so the way that I'm consuming information is thinking in preparation for that and I'm also writing an essay my next really big long-form essay called why work went wrong and so I've been studying all the different people and now this is a bit more of the school style but I'm just reading in service of that so I already have probably 70 80 percent of the information but I'm just trying to fill in the holes right I already have the brick I just need to look for the mortar so that's how I think of consuming information I basically never just sit back and consume just for the enjoyment of it with writing I mean I do it sometimes but most of my consumption is still fairly purposeful and that's what allows me to publish a couple hundred thousand words every year on a next question yeah there are a few questions about how you guys market your content and what are the best sites or sources that you use in order to distribute your writing Nick yes so I'm mostly you 01:0:2,960 --> 01:0:5,040 01:0:2,970 --> 01:0:7,050 my email I think the most important if I 01:0:5,030 --> 01:0:7,050 01:0:5,040 --> 01:0:9,810 to rank them would be email list than 01:0:7,040 --> 01:0:9,810 01:0:7,050 --> 01:0:11,790 Twitter I don't have a Facebook so I 01:0:9,800 --> 01:0:11,790 01:0:9,810 --> 01:0:13,860 don't do that and I've use LinkedIn but 01:0:11,780 --> 01:0:13,860 01:0:11,790 --> 01:0:15,210 like I don't even get that I'll get I 01:0:13,850 --> 01:0:15,210 01:0:13,860 --> 01:0:16,470 don't know how many clicks I get I can't 01:0:15,200 --> 01:0:16,470 01:0:15,210 --> 01:0:18,330 even track that but I know I'm not 01:0:16,460 --> 01:0:18,330 01:0:16,470 --> 01:0:20,220 getting that many so it's not even worth 01:0:18,320 --> 01:0:20,220 01:0:18,330 --> 01:0:21,270 my time to even trop the Li to do that 01:0:20,210 --> 01:0:21,270 01:0:20,220 --> 01:0:23,580 uneven drop the link in there anymore 01:0:21,260 --> 01:0:23,580 01:0:21,270 --> 01:0:25,020 but it's mostly Twitter and the email us 01:0:23,570 --> 01:0:25,020 01:0:23,580 --> 01:0:27,420 I think the email is most important 01:0:25,010 --> 01:0:27,420 01:0:25,020 --> 01:0:28,950 because those are the people who are the 01:0:27,410 --> 01:0:28,950 01:0:27,420 --> 01:0:30,330 most serious about it though we see at 01:0:28,940 --> 01:0:30,330 01:0:28,950 --> 01:0:31,920 Twitter sometimes people just missed 01:0:30,320 --> 01:0:31,920 01:0:30,330 --> 01:0:32,880 tweets like I follow a lot of people on 01:0:31,910 --> 01:0:32,880 01:0:31,920 --> 01:0:34,950 Twitter that I really like and respect 01:0:32,870 --> 01:0:34,950 01:0:32,880 --> 01:0:37,170 and I read all their stuff but I still 01:0:34,940 --> 01:0:37,170 01:0:34,950 --> 01:0:38,040 miss tweet so it's like just because you 01:0:37,160 --> 01:0:38,040 01:0:37,170 --> 01:0:39,270 know you put something out there doesn't 01:0:38,030 --> 01:0:39,270 01:0:38,040 --> 01:0:41,790 necessary mean someone's gonna see which 01:0:39,260 --> 01:0:41,790 01:0:39,270 --> 01:0:43,320 is unfortunate so that's it and then 01:0:41,780 --> 01:0:43,320 01:0:41,790 --> 01:0:44,340 once you kind of put out enough stuff 01:0:43,310 --> 01:0:44,340 01:0:43,320 --> 01:0:45,990 out there people just come back to your 01:0:44,330 --> 01:0:45,990 01:0:44,340 --> 01:0:47,490 site there's certain people I don't have 01:0:45,980 --> 01:0:47,490 01:0:45,990 --> 01:0:49,380 I'm not on their email list I don't see 01:0:47,480 --> 01:0:49,380 01:0:47,490 --> 01:0:50,430 their tweets that often but every so 01:0:49,370 --> 01:0:50,430

--> 01:1:32,250 butter like nothing else really matters 01:1:29,690 --> 01:1:32,250 01:1:29,700 --> 01:1:35,940 I mean I was actually just thinking 01:1:32,240 --> 01:1:35,940 01:1:32,250 --> 01:1:38,520 today like Twitter metrics are are fun 01:1:35,930 --> 01:1:38,520 01:1:35,940 --> 01:1:40,050 and I have a Twitter course if you want 01:1:38,510 --> 01:1:40,050 01:1:38,520 --> 01:1:43,020 to learn about how I think about Twitter 01:1:40,040 --> 01:1:43,020 01:1:40,050 --> 01:1:45,750 it's an email course and now I have a 01:1:43,010 --> 01:1:45,750 01:1:43,020 --> 01:1:48,800 horse on teachable that's a full online 01:1:45,740 --> 01:1:48,800 01:1:45,750 --> 01:1:52,170 course of just pre-recorded videos so 01:1:48,790 --> 01:1:52,170 01:1:48,800 --> 01:1:53,880 with that email course you'll you'll 01:1:52,160 --> 01:1:53,880 01:1:52,170 --> 01:1:56,400 you'll learn just the basics of how I 01:1:53,870 --> 01:1:56,400 01:1:53,880 --> 01:1:58,260 think about it and what's great is 01:1:56,390 --> 01:1:58,260 01:1:56,400 --> 01:2:2,070 people take that course they come on the 01:1:58,250 --> 01:2:2,070 01:1:58,260 --> 01:2:4,290 email list and then I promote the email 01:2:2,060 --> 01:2:4,290 01:2:2,070 --> 01:2:6,240 list a lot from Twitter because the 01:2:4,280 --> 01:2:6,240 01:2:4,290 --> 01:2:9,840 Twitter following could disappear at any 01:2:6,230 --> 01:2:9,840 01:2:6,240 --> 01:2:11,910 moment like it's a house of cards and I 01:2:9,830 --> 01:2:11,910 01:2:9,840 --> 01:2:15,270 think it's Navarre rava country said 01:2:11,900 --> 01:2:15,270 01:2:11,910 --> 01:2:16,600 that building an audience on somebody 01:2:15,260 --> 01:2:16,600 01:2:15,270 --> 01:2:18,400 else's platform is like 01:2:16,590 --> 01:2:18,400 01:2:16,600 --> 01:2:20,800 building a castle out of sand on the 01:2:18,390 --> 01:2:20,800 01:2:18,400 --> 01:2:23,530 beach that a wave could come right up 01:2:20,790 --> 01:2:23,530 01:2:20,800 --> 01:2:25,210 unexpected and all of a sudden all the 01:2:23,520 --> 01:2:25,210 01:2:23,530 --> 01:2:25,780 hours that you've spent on that castle 01:2:25,200 --> 01:2:25,780 01:2:25,210 --> 01:2:27,880 are gone 01:2:25,770 --> 01:2:27,880 01:2:25,780 --> 01:2:30,340 what's great about email is Nick owns 01:2:27,870 --> 01:2:30,340 01:2:27,880 --> 01:2:32,710 his email list I own my email list and 01:2:30,330 --> 01:2:32,710 01:2:30,340 --> 01:2:34,960 people get those emails I have more than 01:2:32,700 --> 01:2:34,960 01:2:32,710 --> 01:2:39,400 a 50 percent open rate for people who I 01:2:34,950 --> 01:2:39,400 01:2:34,960 --> 01:2:41,440 send to and email is the best place to 01:2:39,390 --> 01:2:41,440 01:2:39,400 --> 01:2:44,560 build an audience with some exceptions 01:2:41,430 --> 01:2:44,560 01:2:41,440 --> 01:2:46,300 and and it's not even close but I think 01:2:44,550 --> 01:2:46,300 01:2:44,560 --> 01:2:49,180 the exceptions are like if you're making 01:2:46,290 --> 01:2:49,180 01:2:46,300 --> 01:2:51,310 videos if you're making podcasts and 01:2:49,170 --> 01:2:51,310 01:2:49,180 --> 01:2:54,160 stuff but if you're a writer I would 01:2:51,300 --> 01:2:54,160 01:2:51,310 --> 01:2:58,740 focus on email and I I haven't heard 01:2:54,150 --> 01:2:58,740 01:2:54,160 --> 01:2:58,740 really any good counter arguments to it 01:2:59,240 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:2:59,250 --> 01:3:4,420 next question other yeah there's some 01:3:1,950 --> 01:3:4,420 01:3:1,960 --> 01:3:6,310 other questions around personal monopoly 01:3:4,410 --> 01:3:6,310 01:3:4,420 --> 01:3:8,830 and what if you have different interests 01:3:6,300 --> 01:3:8,830 01:3:6,310 --> 01:3:10,330 and if you can use writing to find your 01:3:8,820 --> 01:3:10,330 01:3:8,830 --> 01:3:11,650 personal when L boolean how would you do 01:3:10,320 --> 01:3:11,650 01:3:10,330 --> 01:3:14,200 that how would you approach that so I'm 01:3:11,640 --> 01:3:14,200 01:3:11,650 --> 01:3:18,630 thinking about the feedback loop in this 01:3:14,190 --> 01:3:18,630 01:3:14,200 --> 01:3:22,150 yeah I'll answer this so look writing is 01:3:18,620 --> 01:3:22,150 01:3:18,630 --> 01:3:23,860 when you write you don't just write 01:3:22,140 --> 01:3:23,860 01:3:22,150 --> 01:3:25,750 about your personal monopoly I would 01:3:23,850 --> 01:3:25,750 01:3:23,860 --> 01:3:28,080 encourage you to think about that idea 01:3:25,740 --> 01:3:28,080 01:3:25,750 --> 01:3:30,580 of having a personal monopoly but 01:3:28,070 --> 01:3:30,580 01:3:28,080 --> 01:3:32,920 writing will actually show you what 01:3:30,570 --> 01:3:32,920 01:3:30,580 --> 01:3:36,220 you're interested in more than you ever 01:3:32,910 --> 01:3:36,220 01:3:32,920 --> 01:3:38,140 thought so when I first started writing 01:3:36,210 --> 01:3:38,140 01:3:36,220 --> 01:3:39,850 I never expected that I would be doing 01:3:38,130 --> 01:3:39,850 01:3:38,140 --> 01:3:42,370 what I'm doing now I think of a lot of 01:3:39,840 --> 01:3:42,370 01:3:39,850 --> 01:3:44,830 writing is a dance so when you dance 01:3:42,360 --> 01:3:44,830 01:3:42,370 --> 01:3:46,960 when you tango with somebody you take 01:3:44,820 --> 01:3:46,960 01:3:44,830 --> 01:3:49,600 the person's hand and two people work 01:3:46,950 --> 01:3:49,600 01:3:46,960 --> 01:3:52,840 together in order to have a beautiful 01:3:49,590 --> 01:3:52,840 01:3:49,600 --> 01:3:54,550 dance and if person a isn't matching 01:3:52,830 --> 01:3:54,550 01:3:52,840 --> 01:3:56,170 with person B person a is just doing 01:3:54,540 --> 01:3:56,170 01:3:54,550 --> 01:3:57,790 whatever they want and then moving too 01:3:56,160 --> 01:3:57,790 01:3:56,170 --> 01:3:59,740 fast moving too slow doing stuff that 01:3:57,780 --> 01:3:59,740 01:3:57,790 --> 01:4:3,190 requires too much flexibility person B 01:3:59,730 --> 01:4:3,190 01:3:59,740 --> 01:4:4,990 can't keep up with that and writing is 01:4:3,180 --> 01:4:4,990 01:4:3,190 --> 01:4:7,030 very similar to dance between you and 01:4:4,980 --> 01:4:7,030 01:4:4,990 --> 01:4:9,130 your audience so you are the leader you 01:4:7,020 --> 01:4:9,130 01:4:7,030 --> 01:4:11,200 are person a and you are grabbing your 01:4:9,120 --> 01:4:11,200 01:4:9,130 --> 01:4:13,570 audience by the hand you are turning on 01:4:11,190 --> 01:4:13,570 01:4:11,200 --> 01:4:15,730 the music and you are swinging with them 01:4:13,560 --> 01:4:15,730 01:4:13,570 --> 01:4:17,680 when it's time to twirl you are leading 01:4:15,720 --> 01:4:17,680 01:4:15,730 --> 01:4:20,350 that twirl but you're making sure that 01:4:17,670 --> 01:4:20,350 01:4:17,680 --> 01:4:23,560 your audience wants to do that and what 01:4:20,340 --> 01:4:23,560 01:4:20,350 --> 01:4:25,360 you'll see is also as you write as you 01:4:23,550 --> 01:4:25,360 01:4:23,560 --> 01:4:28,210 dance you're gonna realize what kinds of 01:4:25,350 --> 01:4:28,210 01:4:25,360 --> 01:4:29,710 dances you actually

so your personal monopoly will emerge 01:6:9,060 --> 01:6:12,670 01:6:9,070 --> 01:6:14,380 but keep it top of mind so that you can 01:6:12,660 --> 01:6:14,380 01:6:12,670 --> 01:6:18,790 have some direction and an orientation 01:6:14,370 --> 01:6:18,790 01:6:14,380 --> 01:6:20,380 point to guide yourself towards their 01:6:18,780 --> 01:6:20,380 01:6:18,790 --> 01:6:22,270 surplus there are several questions for 01:6:20,370 --> 01:6:22,270 01:6:20,380 --> 01:6:23,920 Nick they're the same question how did 01:6:22,260 --> 01:6:23,920 01:6:22,270 --> 01:6:26,320 you promote your writing in the early 01:6:23,910 --> 01:6:26,320 01:6:23,920 --> 01:6:27,460 days and those periods of quiet like 01:6:26,310 --> 01:6:27,460 01:6:26,320 --> 01:6:30,730 what were some of the strategies that 01:6:27,450 --> 01:6:30,730 01:6:27,460 --> 01:6:32,560 you use yeah so there's I've gotten 01:6:30,720 --> 01:6:32,560 01:6:30,730 --> 01:6:34,119 better at this but like so some of this 01:6:32,550 --> 01:6:34,119 01:6:32,560 --> 01:6:35,980 is a little cringy because when you have 01:6:34,109 --> 01:6:35,980 01:6:34,119 --> 01:6:37,810 like nothing going you're gonna start 01:6:35,970 --> 01:6:37,810 01:6:35,980 --> 01:6:39,970 cold emailing people you're gonna start 01:6:37,800 --> 01:6:39,970 01:6:37,810 --> 01:6:42,040 a check this or clock that's ways to do 01:6:39,960 --> 01:6:42,040 01:6:39,970 --> 01:6:43,420 it that's what's tough but like there 01:6:42,030 --> 01:6:43,420 01:6:42,040 --> 01:6:43,920 are certain people out there that is 01:6:43,410 --> 01:6:43,920 01:6:43,420 --> 01:6:45,329 read 01:6:43,910 --> 01:6:45,329 01:6:43,920 --> 01:6:47,790 you know what what impressed me most 01:6:45,319 --> 01:6:47,790 01:6:45,329 --> 01:6:51,569 about my my colleague slash boss Michael 01:6:47,780 --> 01:6:51,569 01:6:47,790 --> 01:6:53,790 Banach he was in my first 24 hours I 01:6:51,559 --> 01:6:53,790 01:6:51,569 --> 01:6:56,339 have over 50,000 now he was in my first 01:6:53,780 --> 01:6:56,339 01:6:53,790 --> 01:6:58,410 20 and at when he started following me 01:6:56,329 --> 01:6:58,410 01:6:56,339 --> 01:7:0,750 he had 20,000 followers he was well 01:6:58,400 --> 01:7:0,750 01:6:58,410 --> 01:7:1,799 known but that early he said this guy I 01:7:0,740 --> 01:7:1,799 01:7:0,750 --> 01:7:3,900 like this stuff 01:7:1,789 --> 01:7:3,900 01:7:1,799 --> 01:7:6,150 he found me before anyone else did so 01:7:3,890 --> 01:7:6,150 01:7:3,900 --> 01:7:7,589 that blew me away but it just goes to 01:7:6,140 --> 01:7:7,589 01:7:6,150 --> 01:7:9,569 show like if you put your stuff out 01:7:7,579 --> 01:7:9,569 01:7:7,589 --> 01:7:11,460 there tweeted people do this get into 01:7:9,559 --> 01:7:11,460 01:7:9,569 --> 01:7:13,079 people's DM say would you read this if 01:7:11,450 --> 01:7:13,079 01:7:11,460 --> 01:7:14,339 they don't respond that's fine but some 01:7:13,069 --> 01:7:14,339 01:7:13,079 --> 01:7:15,420 of them will someone will say hey and if 01:7:14,329 --> 01:7:15,420 01:7:14,339 --> 01:7:17,190 you ask for feedback they'll give you 01:7:15,410 --> 01:7:17,190 01:7:15,420 --> 01:7:18,599 feedback you know all sorts of stuff 01:7:17,180 --> 01:7:18,599 01:7:17,190 --> 01:7:20,400 that's kind of what I did I don't do 01:7:18,589 --> 01:7:20,400 01:7:18,599 --> 01:7:21,750 that now obviously but like when I first 01:7:20,390 --> 01:7:21,750 01:7:20,400 --> 01:7:23,390 was starting I was just trying to put 01:7:21,740 --> 01:7:23,390 01:7:21,750 --> 01:7:25,950 things out there see what would stick 01:7:23,380 --> 01:7:25,950 01:7:23,390 --> 01:7:27,299 and yeah and so it's it's gonna be tough 01:7:25,940 --> 01:7:27,299 01:7:25,950 --> 01:7:29,069 early on it really is it's the hardest 01:7:27,289 --> 01:7:29,069 01:7:27,299 --> 01:7:30,540 part they tried to do it again I maybe 01:7:29,059 --> 01:7:30,540 01:7:29,069 --> 01:7:31,829 wouldn't have done it I don't know I 01:7:30,530 --> 01:7:31,829 01:7:30,540 --> 01:7:32,910 debate cuz it's like it's all in your 01:7:31,819 --> 01:7:32,910 01:7:31,829 --> 01:7:34,980 head your all in your head that says 01:7:32,900 --> 01:7:34,980 01:7:32,910 --> 01:7:37,140 love you can deal with like just getting 01:7:34,970 --> 01:7:37,140 01:7:34,980 --> 01:7:39,420 constantly rejected for like you know a 01:7:37,130 --> 01:7:39,420 01:7:37,140 --> 01:7:40,710 while I mean it could take I got lucky I 01:7:39,410 --> 01:7:40,710 01:7:39,420 --> 01:7:41,640 think I got very lucky when sitting 01:7:40,700 --> 01:7:41,640 01:7:40,710 --> 01:7:43,440 about nine months before I started 01:7:41,630 --> 01:7:43,440 01:7:41,640 --> 01:7:44,609 feeling really confident but I think 01:7:43,430 --> 01:7:44,609 01:7:43,440 --> 01:7:46,200 there's people that can be writing for 01:7:44,599 --> 01:7:46,200 01:7:44,609 --> 01:7:48,119 years before they start really seeing 01:7:46,190 --> 01:7:48,119 01:7:46,200 --> 01:7:52,890 some some turnaround you know and so I 01:7:48,109 --> 01:7:52,890 01:7:48,119 --> 01:7:55,859 can't even imagine that I hope that 01:7:52,880 --> 01:7:55,859 01:7:52,890 --> 01:7:57,240 answer that if not yeah I'm starting to 01:7:55,849 --> 01:7:57,240 01:7:55,859 --> 01:7:59,040 type in answers for certain people that 01:7:57,230 --> 01:7:59,040 01:7:57,240 --> 01:8:1,380 ask me questions I was doing that as 01:7:59,030 --> 01:8:1,380 01:7:59,040 --> 01:8:3,180 well so let me go through some of these 01:8:1,370 --> 01:8:3,180 01:8:1,380 --> 01:8:4,770 what are your thoughts on writing and 01:8:3,170 --> 01:8:4,770 01:8:3,180 --> 01:8:7,020 honestly I've talked about that Steven 01:8:4,760 --> 01:8:7,020 01:8:4,770 --> 01:8:8,339 basically just like I think it's great 01:8:7,010 --> 01:8:8,339 01:8:7,020 --> 01:8:9,390 things a great way to start if you're 01:8:8,329 --> 01:8:9,390 01:8:8,339 --> 01:8:10,770 especially like worried about like 01:8:9,380 --> 01:8:10,770 01:8:9,390 --> 01:8:12,480 people judging you just going on and 01:8:10,760 --> 01:8:12,480 01:8:10,770 --> 01:8:13,410 that's what I did 01:8:12,470 --> 01:8:13,410 01:8:12,480 --> 01:8:16,560 should you mark here rather than 01:8:13,400 --> 01:8:16,560 01:8:13,410 --> 01:8:20,120 tweeting we talked about that already do 01:8:16,550 --> 01:8:20,120 01:8:16,560 --> 01:8:20,120 I tailor my content to social media 01:8:20,410 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:8:20,420 --> 01:8:27,359 probably not so I'm sorry a nerd do you 01:8:24,439 --> 01:8:27,359 01:8:24,449 --> 01:8:28,890 want to start there was a question for 01:8:27,349 --> 01:8:28,890 01:8:27,359 --> 01:8:30,239 both of you regarding weeding how do you 01:8:28,880 --> 01:8:30,239 01:8:28,890 --> 01:8:31,799 schedule your weeding and how much 01:8:30,229 --> 01:8:31,799 01:8:30,239 --> 01:8:33,540 reading do you do in terms of like 01:8:31,789 --> 01:8:33,540 01:8:31,799 --> 01:8:36,000 reading and writing and not balance 01:8:33,530 --> 01:8:36,000 01:8:33,540 --> 01:8:38,069 David yeah I probably spend more time 01:8:35,990 --> 01:8:38,069 01:8:36,000 --> 01:8:39,960 writing than I do reading I mean I spend 01:8:38,059 --> 01:8:39,960 01:8:38,069 --> 01:8:44,219 way more time creating than I do 01:8:39,950 --> 01:8:44,219 01:8:39,960 --> 01:8:46,350 consuming like my I don't have any 01:8:44,209 --> 01:8:46,350 01:8:44,219 --> 01:8:49,469 scheduled reading time I probably only 01:8:46,340 --> 01:8:49,469 01:8:46,350 --> 01:8:52,640 really get to reading like at a decent 01:8:49,459 --> 01:8:52,640 01:8:49,469 --> 01:8:55,529 amount like three or four days a week 01:8:52,630 --> 01:8:55,529 01:8:52,640 --> 01:8:57,430 but when I read I usually read right 01:8:55,519 --> 01:8:57,430 01:8:55,529 --> 01:9:0,040 before bed and I read for a why 01:8:57,420 --> 01:9:0,040 01:8:57,430 --> 01:9:4,930 like I'll do like four for our reading 01:9:0,030 --> 01:9:4,930 01:9:0,040 --> 01:9:7,180 Sprint's but like today I haven't read 01:9:4,920 --> 01:9:7,180 01:9:4,930 --> 01:9:9,250 anything tomorrow I'm pretty busy won't 01:9:7,170 --> 01:9:9,250 01:9:7,180 --> 01:9:11,320 read anything like for me the key is 01:9:9,240 --> 01:9:11,320 01:9:9,250 --> 01:9:13,390 that I have a note-taking system and I 01:9:11,310 --> 01:9:13,390 01:9:11,320 --> 01:9:15,670 also just try to do super interesting 01:9:13,380 --> 01:9:15,670 01:9:13,390 --> 01:9:18,100 things that are worth writing about like 01:9:15,660 --> 01:9:18,100 01:9:15,670 --> 01:9:20,590 I always think about how can I be 01:9:18,090 --> 01:9:20,590 01:9:18,100 --> 01:9:22,000 interesting to myself because if I can 01:9:20,580 --> 01:9:22,000 01:9:20,590 --> 01:9:24,940 be interesting to myself that'll be 01:9:21,990 --> 01:9:24,940 01:9:22,000 --> 01:9:28,360 interesting to other people so I my 01:9:24,930 --> 01:9:28,360 01:9:24,940 --> 01:9:31,960 tolerance for boredom is very low like 01:9:28,350 --> 01:9:31,960 01:9:28,360 --> 01:9:36,370 if I'm bored peace out bye thank you 01:9:31,950 --> 01:9:36,370 01:9:31,960 --> 01:9:40,360 next like I and just leave and so for me 01:9:36,360 --> 01:9:40,360 01:9:36,370 --> 01:9:43,150 when it comes to when it comes to 01:9:40,350 --> 01:9:43,150 01:9:40,360 --> 01:9:46,000 reading and writing I just you know do 01:9:43,140 --> 01:9:46,000 01:9:43,150 --> 01:9:48,760 it whenever I can and just try to say 01:9:45,990 --> 01:9:48,760 01:9:46,000 --> 01:9:51,880 how many things can I actually do with 01:9:48,750 --> 01:9:51,880 01:9:48,760 --> 01:9:55,300 my life that are higher than my already 01:9:51,870 --> 01:9:55,300 01:9:51,880 --> 01:9:56,650 very low bar for for boredom I just get 01:9:55,290 --> 01:9:56,650 01:9:55,300 --> 01:9:57,820 bored so easily so if something 01:9:56,640 --> 01:9:57,820 01:9:56,650 --> 01:9:59,140 entertained me it's gonna be interesting 01:9:57,810 --> 01:9:59,140 01:9:57,820 --> 01:10:1,000 and then I get to write about those 01:9:59,130 --> 01:10:1,000 01:9:59,140 --> 01:10:3,220 interesting experiences which I actually think is a big help so I would I think that too often we think of reading and as you consume things and then you produce things right it's like you eat food and then you turn them into nutrients and the new I don't know you then you get stronger and stuff and that's not really the case I would think much more of an interplay of how do I read interesting stuff consume interesting things and live an interesting life and both consuming interesting things and living an interesting life create the forcing function for good ideas and good writing okay there there are three questions that are the same about how do you guys talk get credit when credit is due and someone's saying that they feel kind of like scared to go back to the original sources and they have a great feel of plagiarism so many ideas are not like whenever how do you paraphrase or how do you give credit to people or how do you source the different things that are not necessarily yours I just straight up just for like hey this idea came from this or as this person said in this book I don't have any fear of that at all even if it's like I might have a similar idea that's just a little variation on it I might just take an idea that's old and just bury it like for example I had this post called avoid the zeros which is about not necessarily trying to be the best and be optimal but just to avoid all the bad behaviors and that's like via negativa from Talab that's I mean so many people have written about that that's not a new idea I just read I just called it a avoid the zeros I literally just renamed it rebranded an old idea I think that is writing I mean that is effective writing rebranding old ideas I think works yeah the amount of information that you consume that is rooted in some new original idea basically rounds to zero basically everything that you write or everything that you read and everything that you write is going to be from other stuff like that is part of it that's what we do as humans but you know there was a essay that a lot of libertarians like to cite called I pencil from 1945 and the whole point of the essay was that no one can make a pencil like there's not a single person on earth who knows how to dig out graphite who knows how to sell that pencil who knows how to write like the beautiful little Dixon Ticonderoga green on a pencil who also knows how to make the eraser who also knows how to make I'm looking for my pencil who also knows how to make like this green stuff here who also knows how to have the lead who also knows how to get the oil that's required to do all this who also knows how to make the trucks that ship the pencil to me like that is how the world works like we it is a collaborative process where we're all helping each other to to work things out and when you are committed to saying you know what this idea is going to be 100% original you're basically saying I'm not gonna benefit from all the people who have lived before me now when you make a pencil you don't have to credit every single person you credit them by buying the graphite or the lead that's needed to actually produce the pencil in writing of course you credit those people but school like really instills this like do not borrow from other people mentality and it hurts us as writers because then we're afraid to build on top of other people when what's arrogant isn't to what's arrogant is to say that you're going to just have all of these brilliant ideas on your own and you're not going to take all the knowledge that you've put into your mind and kind of synthesize it and repackage it like Nick did with avoid all zeroes and provided that you're crediting people properly you're thanking them you're building upon other people's work that is what the pursuit of knowledge is that is the story of humanity we stand on the shoulders of people who have come before us and when you refuse to do that you are not taking part in the human march towards more and more knowledge and more and more progress sorry I was muting how do you decide if a topic or an article series should be turned into a book I have no idea I've never read I always gonna say the same thing in a book either so I'm like yes but I think if you have something that's like really deep and you're like I can write 10 20 blog posts on this that's it but I haven't found that yet I don't know if I'll probably never write a book to be honest but who knows yeah I mean I would just say like I've been thinking a lot about this because I might write a book about rite of passage and what I would say when you write a book is when you have a book is when you have knowledge that has been so distilled and so well thought out that you're ready to put it out into the world and you're ready to say that this is worth people thinking about for at least the next decade without me changing anything so a book has to be timeless it has to be well thought out and it has to be something that like a blog form-factor isn't worth doing now there also are books as business cards and that's sort of a different story but that's not why I would ever want to write a book I want to write a book so that my grandchildren's grandchildren can read that book and say this is still interesting I feel like that's when you write a book that's what a book is like I was talking to Morgan Housel this week and he said we're talking about the longtail on his book and that's what he said his goal was he said he wants his book to have a long tail meaning he wants his book to continue to sell for years and years and years and if that's not what you're ready to do don't write a book have a blog yeah I agree so I kind of like blogging because if so I'm saying I put a post out there and doesn't do well I just move on go to the next one like a lot of my posts I wouldn't I don't consider them success and failure everything is a degree it's not 1 or 0 it's like oh this was more successful than this even like a bad post today we'll still get more views than one of my best posts like three years ago right so it's like it's not really true that like quality's always matters I mean it does but like at some point in the future I'm guessing my average post will get even more abuse than like a good post I get now right but who knows she's taking it a day at a time oh no let's do one more question yeah I've been answering some I've been trying to type some if they're like related to me or something or something I think it'd help but yeah what other ones should we do in it there's a good one that I can't find now but it was about how do you structure how do you think about an idea when you have an idea like how do you go from that idea into writing if you could give an example of your process yeah so I would think of it like a cubist painting so what the Cubist tried to do is before the Cubist's like if you look at the history of painting right like take a Rembrandt portrait what a Rembrandt portrait is is it's a very good representation Rembrandt was painting portraits of people in Holland and he was there in like the 15th and 16th century was all about realism and you know even with even with Monet I was at the Met a couple months ago when I was looking at Monet's early paintings from like 1860 and and and this was right around the invention of the camera and his early paintings are are basically realistic so he's painting what the Mediterranean looked like from the eye and then as he gets into and as we got into the late 19th century we had the camera and what the camera did was it took out realism it said realism isn't important anymore and we're gonna start painting our representation of what the world looks like so that's how you get the famous Monet water lilies that have this sort of like Technicolor glow in in Monet love garden so love flowers and stuff like that that's also how you get the van Gogh swirls that we all love right that was Van Gogh's crazy mind him painting not what he saw really but how he felt about what he saw and what happened was what the Cubist's tried to do and this where I'm getting into in terms of how I think about writing what the Cubist's tried to do sort of beginning with Picasso would say how do we take and then Cezanne how do we take a 2-dimensional page and then represent it in a three-dimensional way so that's what I try to do with writing I try to take a certain idea and then begin to look at it from all these different angles I try to look at it from the bottom try to look at it from the sides from up top how do I do that well I will look at all these different perspectives so I'm writing this essay called why work went wrong so I'm trying to get a different perspective so I'm going down the Marxist Canon like I've never read Marx I know economics fairly well but the classical economists generally discard his ideas and also what I'm doing is I'm starting to talk to people so almost everyone I talked to I talk about this essay so then what I begin to understand is how are people culturally perceiving this idea and then what do I need to do to explain this I yeah in a way that is simple logical memorable and easy to understand and through conversations I then be get good at working out the idea so that by the time that I sit down at the page I've done my cubist painting of seeing it from all these different angles and I can actually just write Nick how do you do it besides our dinner conversations always a mistake in front of us how I do them what I'm sorry what I was answering some questions how do you do how do you think of new ideas I just as I said I just read a lot and things just like connected how do you work through new ideas so like once you have an idea and you're ready to write how do you think about how you're gonna structure that thing you just sort of stay in your room I know you and I though and I just start thinking about like how I like how I imagine myself giving a speech almost like okay if I was gonna say this in front of a room of people what would I say I would start with this and then go to this I know I have an idea of like okay these couple of points I want to hit I don't may not know the order yet but it'll just it'll be like oh this flows to this I'll just I'll just know it like you just know when it feels right I know that so yeah so an any other question see we were getting some more questions even coming how'd you get over writer's block that's a great question writer's well if you have writer's block it means that ideas probably not that good yet you haven't spent enough time thinking about it yet and I trust me I've have arrived well I'm like how do I want to say this one and sometimes I kind of just like you know maybe I kind of just put it together and it doesn't work out as well and maybe those parts good but the one set and Morgan houses are the same thing the Post said just like Oh once you like thought it all out up here and they just come out those ones are generally gonna do better than the ones that you just struggle with I find if I just struggle really hard the idea is not that good if the idea is really good it just writes itself it's like oh my god this is so obvious you know yeah yeah I was talking to Alex Danko who's another phenomenal writer and he said something very similar he said that most of his best articles are what Derek Siver's calls obvious to you amazing to others so for him they're just they're they're common-sense they're intuitive for him but then other people read them like whoa how did you come up with that and Alex always says that his best articles are just dead on simple he knows exactly what to write and even I was talking to honor a couple weeks ago and I came up with this article called teaching like a state and I just had this mental tapestry of different ideas and I said boom I got the idea like it just popped into my brain and then the whole article can kind of come in and then what I just do is I just talked to a couple people for me it's always just talking and just trying to work it out so I think what's interesting is Nick imagines that he's gonna do a speech I try to talk to people which is basically like a one-on-one speech and through that we then find the structure but I think that's a great place to close and I want to thank you all for for for joining us tonight and for for being here and you can
