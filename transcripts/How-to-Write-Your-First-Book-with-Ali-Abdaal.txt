i want to introduce our guest of honor ali abdul i just checked his channel 2.66 million youtube subscribers which is just absolutely bonkers like i always think of baseball stadiums which are like 40 000 people so ali you have like 70 baseball stadiums or 80 baseball stadiums worth of people who subscribe to your channel which is just absolutely insane and you're incredibly prolific you are a writer in terms of writing the youtube videos that you do in terms of the team that you lead i think it's now 17 people and now you're working on a book which is a lot of what we're going to talk about today and i'm just a huge fan of yours especially after spending a week with you in london earlier this month so welcome to the workshop man yeah thanks for having me on uh it's an honor to be here talking about book stuff uh writing is a thing that i have been struggling with for a few years now i think you know with the when it comes to the medium of video i've kind of gotten used to it but there's all sorts of challenges associated with writing that i have not yet gotten used to that's in writing a book writing twitter writing website blog posts like i find it now easy to make a youtube video but it's so much harder for me to write a blog post or to write a twitter thread um and so yeah just want to learn learn everything i can from email i'll start off with a question for you ali when we were in london we had a we had our own little writing therapy session that i think we're going to replicate and build on today but one of the things i said to you is you are really down on the on the book that you're writing and i think this applies to all of you whether you're early on in writing articles whether you're trying to write more substantial essays and you were down with some of your early drafts and what i said to you is you hadn't been through the cycles from a shitty first draft into something good and i want to dive into that what do you think is going on there with your lack of faith in the ability to improve your ideas on the page that's a really good question yeah so i think um as per your advice we have now hired an external editor who we started working with with as of yesterday um so that's exciting but i think like when i when i put my ideas on the page i just think they're absolutely awful i think why the hell would anyone read this like it's it's a show it's like the the they kind of don't make sense maybe there's a sentence here and there where i think okay that actually sounds reasonable but when i compare it to the books i have you know the books in the genre that i read all the time when i compare it to any other book i've ever read i and i think ugh this is really well done and then i look at my stuff and i think it's just so bad and yeah i guess that was something that you and i were sort of exploring as to why i feel that about basically everything that i write why do you feel like you don't have faith in your writing in a way that you do with youtube videos like like what are the ways that they're the same versus different um i i earnestly felt like you didn't have faith that you could take a first draft that you weren't satisfied with and and improve it it was as if like it was like people talk about the northern lights we've never seen the northern lights so somehow it just like feels like this elusive mystery that isn't actually there it's like you've heard about it but you don't actually understand it yeah it's like with youtube videos like you know i was filming a video earlier today comparing six different noise canceling headphones and it took like four hours to film and it was a faff all the way through and i was throwing myself and swearing at the camera and just you know sort of really struggling all the way through filming this video but i know that in the edit it's gonna look seamless and it's gonna look sick because i have done this experience of turning what is a show in filming into a polished product and editing hundreds of times over the last five years now when it comes to writing i've never done that and so i think that's what happens where it's like i know what i'm writing is awful but i haven't seen what the editing process looks like to actually make it good ever and so when people say oh you know a book is written in the edit i'm like okay if you say so but like currently it looks really bad and i have no idea how it how it's going to turn from that into a final product having having just not not done it before yeah one of the things from spending so much time with you just a couple weeks ago that i know you're struggling with is finding the space the time in your life to write and this is something that every single person on this workshop right now it faces and so where have you succeeded and where have you failed in that endeavor yeah good question so finding the time to write i think the reason it's been hard is that writing is always one of those things that is important but never urgent whereas for the other stuff that i do you know when i was working as a doctor you have no option other than to go into work it's just not in my consideration and you know if someone tells me to do something that oh you know this patient needs a blood needs a blood test or needs an iv or whatever it's not an option it's gonna get done similarly i think that was the way i approached my youtube channel for the last five years where we have to upload a video or two every single week and there's just no two ways about it and so i think i'm not gonna let you get away with that because you created that urgency you created whatever that was wasn't that your initiative so i feel like there was no law of the universe like somebody with an iv like i feel like you constructed that urgency yes that's very true so i constructed the urgency for youtube videos and i have not yet constructed that urgency when it comes to writing i think i think also part of the reason is that if if for example i i decided that hey i'm going to publish a blog post every week or a twitter thread every week okay i can turn that into a think of urgency but with a book it's like i need to have done my book six months from now where i've got 80 000 words and it's good and it's like that is a mountain which i have not yet had the um discipline or consistency to turn into these actual bite-sized bits and turn it into something that has that has a deadline yeah for the book talk about that sort of main premise the pilot the plane and the engineer and how i i think a lot for a lot of us when we're thinking about writing having these these metaphors that provide a frame for what we're thinking about can really guide us is that something you're still using and how has that evolved over time and explain the metaphor yeah so i've been thinking about this like any time i talk to someone about the book they're like oh what's your book about and i'm always like oh that's that's a really good question and i really wish i knew the answer to that question um this was the first thing this new editor said when she came in she was like okay we need to figure out what this book is actually about because i think you start off with a key idea and then you go off on this sort of structuring stuff and then you start to miss the forest from the trees and you pull back a bit and you're like okay what's actually the key idea that i'm trying to express here so i guess if i were to describe what the book is about it's it's it's basic it's it's sort of a book about productivity but it's not really in that it's it's trying to answer the question how the hell does scrubber basically the the thesis of the book is that um we think that the path to success productivity and whatever is through discipline and through hard work whereas there is another way and that way is to make the thing that we're doing more fun and if we make it more fun then we're more likely to do it and we can work with our kind of human psyche where fundamentally we only do things that we actually want to do and i think so far if we kind of go a little bit better when it comes to writing this book i have not yet found a way to make it fun and to make it fun enough that i actually want to do it whereas for youtube videos it's actually quite fun making youtube videos working with a team it's fun working with the team it's fun showing up each day and thinking about what content to make i get immediate feedback i get audience audience participation i get views and so on so making a video feels fun that i want to do it but writing feels not fun and therefore i don't want to do it and so in a way i'm trying to solve that problem that's in in theory anyway i think that's what the book is about this idea that we can make whatever we want to do more fun and then we're more likely to do it how would you use your own advice to sort of talk to yourself like if i come to you hey man i'm i'm writing a book and i just don't don't enjoy it that much i really want to write it i have a bunch of expertise i was one of the top students at cambridge at cambridge then i built a giant youtube channel uh while also being a full-time doctor but i just haven't so i have all this expertise but i just haven't found a way to make it fun like ollie can you help me out okay um so i think there's two things um there are broadly two problems that most people have that i have in this as well the first one is procrastination which is a problem with getting started and the second one is distraction which is a problem with like staying focused once you're already once you've already started so the advice that i would give to you in that position is like okay are you having a problem with just getting started and putting words on the page or are you having a problem with um kind of losing focus and doing other stuff when you should be writing and so i kind of be asking asking that question um so what would your hypothetical response in that situation be and we'll kind of go one way or another i mean i would just say i mean i i the the biggest thing i'm taking from this is you figured out how to do small chunks really well and i just think that this project is too big right now yes i agree so that's kind of how i i think that's a big part of in general why we procrastinate from things and it's weird because i'm sort of suffering through this as i'm writing and researching about this stuff as well we procrastinate when something is too hard and essentially the the solution to making the solution to procrastination is to lower the bar and make it as easy as possible now one way of making things easier is by actually having clarity on what we're actually doing here um i used to find with you know when i was when i was a medical student if if i would say that okay i've got this three hours to study physiology nothing is going to get done because study physiology is like too big a thing it's like there's a textbook that has 1500 pages i'm not going to study physiology whereas if i found it was like okay i'm going to read pages 45 to 48 of chapter 6 of kidney physiology and answer questions 5 to 10. then it was a much easier thing for me to get started with because now i've actually defined what i'm trying to do and i think one of the issues with the book project is that having never done a book before um i actually haven't figured out a way of chunking it into reasonable sections other than okay let me try chapter one this week chapter two that week but then it turned out it's actually quite hard to just sit down and write and so maybe there's an outline step before that but then it turns out to figure out the outline you actually need to have a holistic view of the whole book and that's kind of the stuff we're working on with the with the editor here any thoughts on that one of the well it's sort of a slightly separate comment but i really like maps and often you look at these old maps from like 1500 and i think that writing is is a lot like those maps you know like it'll be like the world map and they'll get like the shape of india really right and then they'll like understand like the horn under south africa and sort of how the eastern coast of africa works but then for whatever reason they will have totally missed that madagascar as a country and then they'll think like australia and india are like really close to each other and all this is to say that i think the early stages of writing are just like those maps there are certain parts of an idea that are very accurate and then there's other parts of the idea like some people just think that the earth is flat right and so there's certain things that are just totally baseless that then as you actually begin to move forward on an idea the cartography gets cleaner yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense i feel like right now it's all a bit of a mess with like a few formed ideas here and over there and over there and over there where the rest of it feels like a bit of a mess and then you know i said you're thinking about transitions and stuff but that's it's it's probably way too early for that and we need to figure out figure out a way of making making the map clearer but then i think the if i think about what you said about kind of chunking it down i think the problem is is that i i find it hard to figure out how to chunk how to chunk the project of make the map clearer into smaller manageable chunks that i can do one at a time yeah that makes sense yeah so you could think of it as like islands and bridges what you do when you start is you just build a bunch of islands and so you basically say okay there should be this pile of stuff which is this idea of things that i learned about how to find joy in whatever it is i do and so that's like one pile and then it's like this pile of different ideas around how do i avoid procrastination and you're sort of thinking about different aspects of productivity and you're not worried about those transitions which i call the bridges all you're just trying to do is build individual islands and then what you can do is you can say this week i'm going to build this island next week i'm going to build that island and over time see where different islands connect and then later on you're building bridges between ideas oh that's really good i love that metaphor of islands and bridges i've never heard that one before that's good that would make so much sense because i think i yeah i think right now i'm focusing on i need to start with island number one and then i need a bridge to island number two and a bridge to island number three but in reality i should just be sort of actually scatter gunning approach to the islands filling in the islands and worrying about the bridges and i guess worrying about the sort of which islands go together to form a continent further down the line yeah exactly and i think that that just sort of emerges that's that's that's the hard part of like i i think writing a book where where i mean let's just like go down into writing an article because it's the same way like these things are fractal and so what you experience on a small level often sort of moves into different scales and i mean i see this with with with writing an article all the time so like i was writing a piece this morning and so i had three documents on my screen so on the right i had my most recent document which i'm basically saying like this is gonna be my most recent draft and then on the left i had two rough drafts and so one was like an older draft that's like a little bit more notes and then on the right was like a fresher draft but it's a little messier and i was writing a lot of stuff with my eyes closed to just like try to feel that idea and like have it move through my emotions onto the page and then what i did was i took the best of those and then brought it on to the next page and all this to say over here i'm sort of exploring and then i'm bringing it in and and trying to clean it up in this draft and when you're exploring you don't know what you're going to end up with like all that is very sort of emergent and random nice yeah i think i think that's where that's one of the very tactical ways in which i am probably doing this wrong in i am kind of working within i'm working in a single google doc right now which in a way as much as i'm i'm against the whole bro which pen do you use to write i think the pen the pen of google docs encourages a very linear form of thinking whereas just that thing you said of just having three documents side by side i was like ah that's that's a great idea that sort of makes it more of a able to be a little bit more creative and move things around wait that's really interesting like what what else could you do that doesn't feel like writing that is developing these ideas like one of the things we do when we plan write a passage is before every cohort so will and i will meet and we'll sit down and we'll spend like a whole week and we'll put a bunch of ideas like everything we want to accomplish on post-it notes and then we'll put them on this like post-it board and then we'll just start rearranging things and what we find is we find that there's connected themes that have been emerging and so say we start with 70 post-it notes we'll be like okay we got to get to 20 post-it notes and to try to like bundle different projects into one thing and what we find is that these themes just begin to emerge and it's fun because it doesn't feel like planning which is normally like writing a memo and all that stuff which people don't want to do yeah that's a really good point that's kind of what me and me and angus did as well when we were planning our youtuber academy we just sat down and spilled a bunch of post-it notes over the course of a day and that worked really well and i haven't yet done that when it comes to the book i think i've been stuck in this is a book and therefore i need to write rather than actually thinking a bit more creatively about what that would look like post-it notes a3 pads sharpies um i think that kind of stuff would also make it much make it feel much more fun especially because then i can do it with someone and doing stuff with people is always more fun than doing it solo for most of us that's a great idea i should do that oh yeah actually i can do that tomorrow morning i have book writing time tomorrow morning and um what do you see is the differences let's switch gears what do you see is the difference between writing for video and writing for for for articles ah one of the main differences is that when you're writing for video you can get away with a lot more um when i'm writing for video i can make i can i can make like logical leaps and um you know non-sequiturs and stuff in a way where you really can't get away with in writing because on video be like oh point number one and therefore point number two and if i say with enough confidence and when i style and we cover it with enough b-roll and the background music the vibe very few people are watching a video thinking very critically about the information that's being shared in the video whereas in an article you don't have a lot of if one idea doesn't translate to another idea it's just really obvious when you're writing it and i guess also for a reader that hang on that actually doesn't follow from that so i think as this is another reason why i find writing harder like i actually do need to be more logical with my points and my own i don't know style and charisma on camera doesn't automatically carry it yeah i want to see i want to sort of do a little experiment so we have michael dean and he's like the john madden foreign passage so what he does is he comes in he's like one of those football announcers who comes in with the play-by-play and sort of like breaks down what's going on and uh he does this all the time in in our rite of passage live session so michael uh i'm gonna let you pop in and share and share your ideas and we'll see what what ollie um is able to run with here i think you have screen share permissions it doesn't seem like i have it yet try now perfect all right here we go so this is an image of david using that posted method to kind of like outline these little atomic units right um he's used the word like a mosaic before like you're building a coliseum one brick at a time so ali considering video is fun for you imagine if you had these little short form three-minute videos right you clustered them into sections um and then basically you're outlining through video and only after you actually go through that ideation process will you kind of get the feeling if you know a little block is worth it or not um and then i think the editing process is looking within a block and then you start to rearrange it only after you've made the bricks and so these white chunks the white the white little squares are ones that you keep the gray ones are ones that you cut and then you might even come up with green ones like new segments that you need to integrate uh into the process that's a very good idea that could work really nicely for like the first draft stage because or rather the the conceptual ideation stage because i do find it very easy to speak things and i find it a lot harder to write them yeah it's the same thing with otter i don't know david if you want to speak to that how sometimes getting the ideas out through audio is is kind of a step for yeah so check this so that's exactly what i do so i think of conversations as a generator of new ideas but they're not a generator of clear and precise ideas that's what writing does so writing is a medium that helps you be clear and efficient in how you're saying things but then what's great about speaking is like when i was in london visiting ali last week i just walked back from dinner and so what i did was i opened up this app called otter which i highly recommend and i was just on my walk home i basically just recorded all of this and so this was just me talking and what what i do all the time is i will if i'm walking somewhere or after an interesting conversation i'll just speak and i use that as a prototype of ideas just to get stuff out and then i think of writing is really a process of refinement and i think a lot of the times where people go wrong with writing is in their first draft they have like there's something about writing that feels like there's a lot of pressure in a way that isn't true for speaking and so if you can begin with speaking get stuff on paper and then begin to narrow things down and and and compress and condense it often helps to get ideas out of your head and get new ideas flowing that's a really good point i i remember seeing one of your i i think you mentioned this in a tweet probably about six months ago and i was like oh this is a great idea and i remember that that evening as i was driving i was like driving to my mum's place i just opened up otter and i just started talking one of my chapter outlines and i then completely forgot about it but last week when i started sending stuff to this new editor we're working with i discovered my auto transcript from like six months ago and there were some really good ideas in there i was like oh hello i've actually thought about this there's there's actually some stuff in here and there was a lot of like i mean annoying and effing and budding but like the the core ideas were there and it was kind of surprising to me that oh i should i should really do this otter kind of transcribing audio transcribing thing more often even going for a walk oh i just had a thought i live like my my flat in london is about a 40 minute walk away from this studio and so if i walked walk here in the mornings hey it's nice because i'm getting a morning walk-in and b i can just have my airpods in and just like talk stuff and just be like yeah i'm currently thinking about chapter six chapter six is all about like autonomy and therefore you know here are some ideas and then i can look at that when i get into the studio where i've got three hours of writing time every morning and so theoretically that is a kickstart to the writing time then because i'm not starting from a blank page i know that's something that you talk about a lot in rite of passage at least that it was when i took the course about two years ago that kind of starting from a blank page it's probably bad yeah i mean i did that walk from your apartment to the studio it was great it's great you get to walk by the canal and uh that's actually exactly what i was doing i was just capturing ideas you know i get to go down on uh liverpool street never been there before um yeah exactly it's it's it's so much easier and and and the thing about otter that's really nice is you just get the instant transcript all right this is good so action points for me are i'll walk here tomorrow morning do some auto transcribing on the way here on my airpods and then when i'm here get one of my team members together and we'll do a brainstorm and post-it notes and just on an a3 pad that's lying around so that it feels less like writing and more it's more fun for that initial ideation phase yeah let's let's let's sort of go to the opposite side of this like the process of experiencing something as a reader as a consumer um you know you know me yesterday and she mentioned your name the woman who wrote how not to die alone oh yeah logan yuri yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm going to talk to her she's uh the director of relationship science at hinge and i know you love that book so for you you know you love for our work week you like that book what do they have in common what are you going for oh good question okay so i think for me it's i think it's it's ideas that either that that seems surprising or counterintuitive to me or ideas that i've sort of i sort of agree with but the way that they have phrased them or the way they've put them or the way they've turned it into a system or the way they've like said them feels like oh yes this is that thing that i kind of know is a thing but i haven't had the words to describe it until you mentioned that thing just now i think yeah i think i think generally generally when when things are counter-intuitive or i think really surprising like when when i find things surprising it means that i do not already know the thing because we're gonna get surprised by stuff that's novel to us and so i know that um julian shapiro calls these like uh dopamine dopamine bombs or something like that where you get that little spike of dopamine because something feels surprising and i think when reading how to not die alone when reading the four-hour workweek when reading atomic habits for the first time there were a lot of those like oh i didn't know that but that's a really interesting way of thinking about this thing that i that i resonate with one of the things i always think about on that note is like i look for images you know something that feels like i can see it and i think that good methods tend to tend to have that like with reddit passage we always try to think of how do we teach things in terms of color and sound and and frameworks that aren't like frameworks that can be seen you know i like frameworks that for example have red yellow and green in them because you end up with every everyone knows that red means no green means yes and yellow means maybe and so you can use that and all of a sudden all of a sudden you end up with with with something that you can immediately latch on to and you know one time i i got to interview neil degrasse tyson and i was in his office and it was like by at the time by far the biggest celebrity i'd ever met i mean still i think neil degrasse tyson is the biggest celebrity i've ever met i asked him like what are you trying to do when you write and what makes you kneel and he said everybody comes to the page with a certain cultural scaffolding and that scaffolding is movies like star wars uh the politics of the day news stories different ideas that are in vogue and what you're trying to do in writing is you're trying to latch on to people's scaffolding and that way what ends up happening is the leap from where people are to where you want them to go is shorter and i think that as writers that's what we're trying to unders that's what we're trying to do we're trying to get in the mind of our reader ask how can i communicate this idea in the way that requires the smallest cognitive leap nice i'm literally writing that down right now because that's a great way of thinking about it so i guess yeah i think i think that makes a lot of sense i think it does require knowing what idea you want to communicate and that is currently the bit where i'm feeling a bit stuck in that again when it comes to when it comes to writing a book it's easy enough to know what the broad ideas are that i want to communicate but then i get a lot of imposter syndrome when it comes to the sub ideas where i think is this actually true like why would anyone listen to me about this maybe my insight on this is just based on a personal example and and we're like okay cool let's find case studies and scientific studies that support this point and we end up going and sort of going way into the weeds where we probably should be zooming out a bit and actually thinking harder about like what are we actually like what i'm actually trying to say on the page right now and i guess what is the most efficient way for the reader to get it well i often just think what do you want as a reader so when you like to read do you like scientific studies do you care about people's personal experience i like a bit of both to be honest i like um i like stuff to be backed up with at least a a nod to scientific evidence because then it makes me feel smart and it makes me feel um that yeah this thing it's not just the order the author making up but i think the thing that i most appreciate is some kind of system um you know james clear's four-part system you know make it easy make it satisfying make it whatever make it whatever for his habits i've even forgotten the system but when i read it i was like oh there's a system sick this is so good and just i think sometimes just the existence of a system oops just the existence of a system makes me feel good that i have understood this in a way that i didn't before let me give you a uh sort of a way to think about this so never had this thought before but on one hand you have a book that is sort of all science and so what that means is everything is empirically validated it's been replicated there's very little humanity all things equal less humanity in that kind of book on the other hand of peace and look this applies to articles applies to everything but on the other hand is it's like all personal experience and that is like well that's just your experience of the world and all those sorts of things and i would say like often like a memoirs like that right and then i think that there's something in the middle which is what i hear you going for which is enough of the science that it feels like it has some weight and some power behind the ideas but i'll tell you right now as someone who can't freaking wait to read this i want to know what ali has experienced and what ali thinks and his unique perspective on this and personally if you believe something and it isn't empirically validated but you know it to be true and you can have stories and you have enough anecdotes that you can believe that i think that that gives you a wedge into ideas that are novel and unique whereas if you insist on empirical validation i think you're gonna tend to create something a little bit more homogeneous and sterile interesting interesting yeah i think that's where the imposter syndrominess comes in because i was very surprised when you said you would want to hear my perspective on stuff because in my mind i'm thinking why the hell would i want to hear hear my perspective on anything it's all like it's not like i'm elon musk for example where i'd like to hear his perspective on something um and i guess kind of that medic background in me is always like well something is not legit unless it's evidence-based unless there's like a whole body of scientific literature backing it up and only then can you really make a claim um but that's that's useful to know that i think i i don't think that's like a sort of um uh i think that will change overnight but i guess i guess every writer just does have to contend with this in some capacity i imagine i well i don't know is this true that when you when you're writing about writing do you feel fully confident in what you're saying or do you feel i'm not really sure if this is true but this is my experience and let me just write about it anyway i don't really i guess i think of it in in in two different ways so the first is when i'm writing a piece about writing or just speaking to you now i say things with conviction either because i know that they've worked for me as a writer and they've solved problems in my own life and i feel those i feel those things intensely or there's a certain idea way of thinking about things that i've said to people repeatedly that i know always causes a spark in people and i'll give you an example of that one of the problems that people run into when they write is that they know that they're going to publish something online and a bunch of people are going to see it and that's what excites them about doing it but the problem that emerges is that people write for a stadium of readers but you actually want to do the exact opposite very paradoxically writing for one person and writing for one person well opens you up and actually has you doing a better job of reaching a mass audience and you wouldn't expect that to be true but i've just had so many students for example i remember in our second cohort with a student her name was rachel and she sent me this email about wanting to join right of passage it was phenom it was phenomenal it was well articulated it was filled with critique and it was just so intelligent and then she gets in the course and now she's writing online and in public and she just has total writer's block she's just totally yeah mortified by the judgment the crowd and what i said to her is rachel if you can be in that same state that you were when you were writing an email writing's going to be so much easier for you so all this to say i've said i've told that story to enough people and so that then becomes like this anecdotal thing that i've gotten validation from others and then there's this other thing if i just know something to be true because it's all my own problems that's on that note so like this is something that i i i've been thinking about this for a while because because tim ferriss also said that he really struggled to write the four-hour work week but then the way he wrote it was in composing a gmail to one of his friends and just writing it like you know dear john here are the things that i want to tell you in this email and sort of getting himself into that mind space of writing a book through an email i guess i i've been thinking about this but i guess where i'm struggling is that like i don't really know who my who that one person is that i'm trying to speak to is this a problem that you get you have with students in because for example in our youtuber academy we always ask people you know who's that one person you want to make the video for and they're like oh well i don't know because i have all these interests and it could be this and it could be that and it could be someone from age 18 to age 58 and i want everyone to benefit from this and it's it's it's hard to figure out who that one one person is so any any tips for that yeah who is the person literally close your eyes who is the person who you are you look at and they're struggling with productivity and you most want to strangle and grab them by the top of their shirt and shake them and yell at them all the ideas that you have in your head that they need to hear who is the person who you can help the very most and whoever that is right interesting i have i i have a friend from school that comes to mind immediately for this and describe the friend like like like what about them are they advanced are they beginners what are they working on you know yeah also being you know you can keep their identity anonymous yeah so he's he's he's a doctor as well very accomplished guy you know top top grades in school and in med school but he's had it he's been interested in writing a book for such a long time he's also been interested in releasing his own music for a very long time and seems to always procrastinate with both of those projects and he's an amazing singer and i've been saying to him for i've been saying to him for years that he should put his singing out there and he's like oh i really want to but oh he has to be perfect and oh it's not going to be good enough and he's definitely one of the best things i've ever met and so i i'm i'm this is good like i'm i'm not thinking about him and thinking about how he could benefit from the stuff in the book it's a good way of thinking of it and so if i write the book for him he's like a 26 year old 27 year old dude based in the uk but then the way i'd write to him is would probably also be accessible to an 18 year old and also to a 35 year old because there's not that much difference between writing for someone who's 27 and writing for someone who's 35 i guess i mean i think that when it comes to getting ideas out of you like you you know like when you go on a rant you know you're just really bothered about something like what is that state of mind it's it's it's it you're outside of your head you're just feeling things like an idea is moving through you and often what you say is a lot of junk but often in a rant you find something inside of you that you never knew that you knew there are these nuggets of truth that come out in rants and so the reason why i always like the strangle test is because it gets you in that very bodily way of thinking about about ideas your like ideas can just move through you and i think that that i think a reader can feel that that passion
