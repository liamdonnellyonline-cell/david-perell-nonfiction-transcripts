my first question for you joe is how did we come to have big gods what is it about big gods and the scale of societies that you've seen in your work yeah so uh i've been interested in this idea of how it is that human societies went from the relatively small scale gods that we see in hunting and gathering and other kinds of societies up to the big powerful moralizing gods that we see in the world today and uh that's actually a transformation that a lot of people aren't aware of when people think of gods they tend to think of these powerful moralizing gods but there's actually a huge variety and in the smallest scale human society sometimes gods might have a kind of moralizing function and they might get angry with people for not sharing or not conducting search of certain rituals but it tends to be very local to agree that it exists at all and many gods are whimsical uh you can often buy them off you can bribe them you can trick them so these are all things that go on in small-scale societies and my colleagues and i have made the case that as society scaled up one of the things that allowed larger and larger groups to cooperate and interact with strangers and kind of expand the circle uh has been a belief a selection pressure on a kind of cultural selection pressure on gods that were more powerful more moralizing and specifically concerned with those elements of human social behavior that would allow societies to scale up so uh fairness with strangers say talk about fairness with strangers what do you mean by that well so uh in lots of places you know when societies are rooted completely in subsistence there's no need to do very much trading and trading is often done through personal relationships but as societies scale up there's a lot of um economic opportunities in trading with people who have different skills or have access to different resources but then there's oh it's also easier to steal from those people so there's this you know push pull and they do more to which people can engage in mutually beneficial transactions the better the more economic benefits they can have but that's hard because there's always a chance the other guy might defect in a sense and steal from you or exploit you or or sell you something that's of low quality that is purported to be of higher quality of course that's still a problem in the real world but you know at this point in the evolution of human societies we're just trying to get trade going at all so uh the more the the the more you have a god that's concerned about that the easier this is and we see this really clearly in the mediterranean when traders would actually go to altars and swear oaths to to the same you know if they believe in the same god they would swear to that god and this seems to have facilitated trade a number of historians have argued that so here you're talking about scaling up with big gods have you looked into the idea of heaven at all you were talking about defection and it seems intuitively that if you have an omnipotent god looking down on a society you have this sort of third-party judge looking at interactions what have you seen there in terms of the game theory of interaction and defection yeah so the way to think about uh so lots of humans everywhere have always been concerned about being observed by third parties one of the key things about humans is that you know we're concerned with social norms if you violate a social norm you get a bad reputation and that can affect future interactions in lots of ways so what the cultural evolution does is it puts a watcher a third party an imaginary one that can potentially be all knowing although that seems to have scaled up over time and have increasingly uh increasingly powerful ways to punish or sanction you or reward you and so in the case of afterlife most human societies didn't believe that gods could control a contingent after life so they may have believed people continued after death but you know might have been in some ghostly form and your behavior in this life didn't affect what was going to happen to you in next life so the key thing about afterlife for what we're talking about is a contingent after life where say a god can have control over that you behave a certain way now and you can get benefits or penalties in the future if if the god doesn't like that way of behaving so that seems to appear relatively late in human history one historical estimate is around uh 5 000 years before the common era are not sorry 500 years before the common era and in a number of different experiments and other kinds of data it does seem that you know believing in heaven seems to me our believing in hell actually does most of the work believing in hell has real effects on people's behavior ha so hell actually is more of a determined deterrent than heaven is a like valhalla that people want to ascend to yeah it's it's interesting so uh and there's this asymmetry so you even see it in an experiment so people who believe more in hell will behave say they'll cheat less in a simple experiment if you look at the degree to which heaven and hell believes predict economic prosperity believing in hell seems to have a big effect believing in heaven relatively less and the idea here is that heaven is pretty easy to believe in like it's kind of a nice thing to believe in it's appealing to think that you might live forever and go to this nice place um hell is not so appealing and to know that you might slip up and end up in hell is not such a pleasant thing so that's the one that has to be favored by the bicultural evolution and it's the one that can make societies behave better uh you know it can prevent people from cheating when they are from it can prevent people from cheating when they might have otherwise cheated because there's an omniscient watcher who might penalize you in the future when it comes to your studies on christianity and how they've influenced weird societies and we can get into the kinship elements and the family elements but i want to start off with the christian elements how have you seen the relationship between heaven and hell change throughout the history of the catholic church and then we can work our way through some other parts of the basic structure of weird societies yeah so uh i mean the point i make in in the weirdest people in the world is that a number of different religious communities have figured out these kind of afterlife tricks and you see it popping up and it spreads through a number of different religions so i don't think that's something that distinguishes christianity and in particular doesn't distinguish the roman catholic church which is the kind of one of the central actors in in what i what i lay out in the weirdest people in the world um what is interesting is that this one brand of christianity not christianities in general but the roman catholic church began to have taboos and rules and prescriptions about how to organize families about who who people could marry when they could marry whether those marriages could be arranged those kinds of things so incest taboos began to spread and apply to lots more people than just brothers and sisters you mentioned arranged marriages what might some of the benefits of arranged marriages be i once probably about a year ago i read a just fantastic article on the way that arranged marriage actually lowers divorce rates and it was an argument from an indian writer saying hey you guys in the in america in europe should actually be more receptive to this idea yeah so uh arranged marriages are you the way to think of them are one way to think of them from an anthropological spec perspective is that they allow families to build strong relationships with them between themselves so it brings two families closer together and this is part of a network so if you have a few different children you're marrying your children off to different uh and that's building your bonds with other families and that's making you more productive it's giving you more political opportunities uh if something bad happens it's potentially more of a social safety net so it's strengthening a whole bunch of things about your social and economic world so there's lots of benefits there and it's the interdependence created by these marriages that probably reduces things like uh divorce uh because people become so kind of kind of enmeshed in a web that you know if you were to leave the web you have no social safety net and and little protection so yeah and also a wealth preservation tactic for different families i couldn't believe that i was talking to a friend in saudi arabia probably two months ago and so we're talking and i'm like hey tell me a little bit about yourself and she goes yeah i'm 27 got married at 22. i'm married to my cousin my we marry within the family they're very conservative saudi arabian family we marry within the family because we want to preserve the wealth and it just makes things easy and then she just keeps going on and on and she starts telling me all these ways that it makes life easier and how the meaning of life for her is much more tied to raising really successful kids and how and this one i was actually quite receptive to having kids for her at 22 years old meant that the grandparents could raise the children which is so much easier than i was talking to my grandma last night and she's in an old person's home and it's just miserable and i've probably only met my grandma you know seven eight ten times yeah so it really these kind of intensive kinship structures uh really bring the grandparents in gives them high status they're often the purveyors of wisdom the kind of cousin marriage that you're talking about in the book i make the the case that and you know building on other people's work that um it's she often in in islamic societies you would marry if she would marry her father's brother's son and this would because cl land is owned patrilineally their wealth is often passed down patrilineal and so that keeps the wealth in the same household whereas in typical societies you would marry your cross cousin uh or some other more distant cousin and that would mean the wealth would leave with the woman if she gets any now the interesting thing about islam is the quran doesn't say anything about marriage cousin marriage uh but it does say that girls have to inherit half of what their brothers inherit and in lots of societies pre-islamic societies the the daughter would have inherited zero so that wouldn't have been a problem but once the quran says that you gotta inherit half then you're gonna lose half you know you're gonna lose a portion of your wealth every time you marry a daughter off but if you marry him to your father's brother or if she marries her father's brother then you keep the wealth in the family so what we see in america right now with some kind of decline of the nuclear family and i don't want to be too dramatic about this but it is happening at some level especially compared to the islam societies that we're talking about here is how big of an anomaly is this through human history people having kids late hyper individualism and if it isn't an anomaly what other cultures are similar to this and how can we look at those cultures to predict how american culture is going to evolve yeah i mean it's pretty anomalous uh so if you look at the database uh there's this thing called the ethnographic atlas which has over about twelve hundred su over twelve hundred different societies in it uh we have independent residents so when a couple gets married they set up shop independent of uh their mother and father of the mother and father of the bride and the groom and uh that's neolocal residents uh that's very rare only five percent of societies in the database have that and if you begin to add all the other kinship traits we have like inheritance through both males and females monogamy only you add those things up you get a vanishingly rare fraction of societies so in that sense the the kind of families we're accustomed to are very rare in human history may be unique and what's happening now in the modern world in the 20th century is even even the monogamous nuclear family is breaking down because we have enough impersonal institutions uh the economic prospects for women are better so that makes them independent you if you have enough money you don't need a a spouse to raise children so we're basically breaking society down to the individual so even even the nuclear family is now fractu fracturing and that's just the spread of individualism got it so the the nuclear family like the draw that correlation to me between the nuclear family and individualism like how is that played out is the correlation really strong and so it sounds like we're saying there is like as individualism rises nuclear families will necessarily become a smaller and smaller part of the way society functions is that right well the the key idea in the book is actually the causal i mean i think the causal error goes both ways but in the book the cause of larrow was that the church took actions that broke these intensive kinship structures down so where you have these cousin relationships and you have these economic and political relationships the social safety net uh the sense of identity the connections across the generations it breaks all that down with all these rules about the family and you get mostly monogamous nuclear families in many parts of europe so then you're you're not quite an individual but you've got to make your way in the world you've got to cultivate your own attributes and achievements and your the way you're going to find friends and business partners and spouses is by having something unique about you or something that at least sets you apart from the next person to begin to build this future relationship where in the other world the world of your friend from saudi arabia all of her rich relationships are set by her birth essentially so she has all these cousin relationships and people she works with and the people are going to take care of her children were all predetermined by her position in the genealogy so that's quite a different world than having to make your way in the world and find business partners friends and spouses on your own so that leads to greater individualism and then the case i make is with this change in psychology this change in social structure europe gets what historians call voluntary associations so guilds you kind of join as a member they give you a social safety net they're kind of a lobbying organization for your interests of your little group these eventually became occupational groups universities are a kind of voluntary association monasteries pop up and begin proliferating as voluntary associations so people are finding strangers with shared interests or shared goals shared views of the world and they're kind of forming an organization uh and it does eventually become political parties and towns become kind of you know you had to join the town to get citizenship and that would give you rights and privileges so this this takes europe on it on a different uh cultural evolutionary path than we'd seen in other places and then so what we see later in history is eventually we get things like social safety nets so the elizabethan poor laws of 1600 for the first time lay a government safety net underneath people so that if you don't have any family connections you can still get um money from the government if some you know if things go bad you don't have a job or something like that and that allows people to be independent even more of their families you talk about social safety nets and what are some of the structural conditions that enable social safety nets to emerge so let me give you a hypothesis and you can tell me right or wrong of one factor that could contribute to this maybe a lack of diversity is correlated with a strong social safety net so if you take an area like scandinavia scandinavia is known as having strong social safety nets high taxes but the government is there to help you with free health care and maybe there is a a tension between allowing immigrants to come in and people who citizens say hey you know what they're not like me and then the decline of a social safety net is that right or what are some of the other factors that actually enable safety nets to arise well uh in terms of the the ideas i lay out in the book for for most populations in over most of human history the social safety net has been provided by these kin-based institutions now with the emergence of states so we're thinking pre-modern states here the government sometimes did a few things to help out but we help out the community level so they would help your town not you as an and then once the church begins to break down these units the church becomes one of the main safety nets and then you get this patchwork of safety nets that are provided by these which included sometimes church organizations but guilds were also social safety nets and etc and then it's not and then it's not until england and a few of the northern uh european countries they begin to take over the safety net job in particular with the spread of protestantism so protestantism plays a role here in giving the job to the government um now in terms of the politics of the modern world and and you know how much of a safety i mean the us is known to have a poor social safety net but i mean there's still unemployment insurance there's still social security so compared to lots of places and lots of times there's a huge social safety net it's just not as big as what's been built in places like sweden and elsewhere but the more independent and individualistic you are and the more mobile you are the more you kind of need a safety net so it may hit americans particularly hard because we're unusually mobile so things go wrong for you you're in a city you moved away from your family years ago you know you got a big problem yeah so i want to switch gears here a little so you lived with the mashagengua people in the peruvian amazon what do you talk about that experience it's just so cool and so unique and what do you think the biggest thing that you've taken from that experience and how you've applied it to your work what has that been like for you well that was really an uh quite an eye-opening experience uh because so that was the the first field work i did and i just my first trip i flew in on a missionary plane and i started going from village to village by dugout canoe and i was studying people's decision-making and cooperation and i was really impressed by how independent individuals were and households were so this gave me a little bit my kind of a first glimpse at um this was kind of like individualism but without higher level society institutions so the matcha ganga traditionally live in single-family or small family hamlets scattered throughout the forest so they don't have like higher level institutions there's no government there's no chiefs or anything like that so people are quite independent and if there's a disagreement say with another family or another someone else in the village people just go away for a while or move away to they have gardens often far off by them you know tucked away in some corner of the of the tropical forest and they'll go there for several months or longer and so this kind of keeps problems with other other families at a minimum but it's very much a kind of social adaptation where people move around uh so it's just a way of seeing a pop group that was culturally similar to me in some interesting ways kind of fiercely uh but also without the impact of all this higher level social institutions and whatnot yeah what do you think stuck out i mean i've had one experience like that that really comes to mind and it wasn't even close to on the same magnitude but one of the things i do remember vividly from being a kid was going to rural china and having not very black hair but like almost brownish hair and people coming up to me and touching my hair as if they thought it wasn't real and then i was with my cousin who had blonde hair and the kids would run up to him and insist on taking photos with him i i i couldn't believe it it was like they had seen a tiger in their living room yeah i know people are always fascinated by these kind of phenotypic differences among populations i mean i have green eyes and people consider that unusual um yeah and i mean the key is like an anthropologist is you want to get beyond the kind of initial phase where people are you know think you're kind of an interesting auditing you kind of want to blend into the background so i always enjoy it you know it takes a couple weeks sometimes before people basically stop paying special attention to you and then you can get a good sense of how life life goes on one of the striking things was having worked in among the matcha genga and then i later did work in fiji and in many ways there were these are just villages they're uh they're growing root crops they're doing some fishing um so in some kind of economic way the communities were similar but fijians have traditionally have chiefs and so there's a chief in the village and when people needed to work together you know the village would just hum like an ant hill and the men would all come up everybody would show up they'd you know they'd get to work there were a couple slackers which would be you know people would joke about the slackers and stuff and sometimes they'd come into the line but in in the matcha ganga village people are so fiercely individualistic and independent that when they needed to do community projects you know their a time would be picked and but people wouldn't show up when it was time to actually do the work and they'd be doing their own thing that you know they're working but they'd be out in their own garden or something like that so this is when i first began to think about the role that social norms play in driving cooperation because it didn't seem like the matcha ganga had social norms for some of these kinds of cooperation they didn't have institutions right sets of social forums whereas the fijians you know had a whole bunch of them and they had a top-down hierarchy and it was clear who was boss and who could give who orders uh and that make things run i like that idea of contributions so i'm doing a my own little anthropological experiment so maybe i'll write a sequel to your book and uh what it is is its six friends living in airbnb for four months and it's been fascinating like what is it like to live with a bunch of friends your age and one thing that's really interesting so i'm a terrible chef like if i cook guests are getting food poisoning and what i'm just not good at it and so what that means is i've had to figure out my role in the food preparation and so for me it's washing dishes cleaning the plates in the morning and we have a a policy that we've all agreed to where we don't wash dishes at night so we we enjoy our dinner and then we get to celebrate throughout the night really we have dinner together every single night and then morning after you gotta wash dishes and it was funny what you just said about the people would joke uh about the people who didn't really contribute and we we saw that so we had friends over the other night and everyone had been drinking for a while and so i was just sort of tired from drinking so i sit down while everyone's clearing the plates and all of a sudden everyone goes around the circle starts making fun of me right it was really interesting i've sort of seen how humor is like this way of sort of casually ribbon people to basically say dude get off your butt do your part yeah i mean uh that's a that's a nomination for human universal so i've seen that from from the machu ganga to uh the south pacific and reddit lots of ethnography saying the same thing this kind of joking ribbing uh that you use in fiji it's interesting there's a certain kind of cousin relationship which is a joking relationship so not everybody can rib you but if you get out of line you have certain cousins who will tee off and they'll just rip you mercilessly until you can get back into line so how do you do this because you don't speak the language so what do you do you just go out with a field notebook and you just watch how do you are do you worry that you miss subtleties when you don't speak the language or i'm sure you've got great strategies for getting around this what are they well the me i mean the main strategy is to try to learn the language um so with the macho gang i spoke spanish there was a fair amount of spanish and i was studying matcha genga the whole time i was there picked up some um and in fiji at various points i'm probably not very good now but i got good enough to pick up things in conversation if i didn't understand something i could check with some someone and i also work with a team approach so i have fijians that i've hired from the main islands who are there working with me so you know they're making observations too a lot of times we might be at a party if there's something i don't pick up i'll check with my research assistant who is also there i'll be like so and so said this and i didn't understand what he said and then my ra will often clear things up tape record things uh there's a lot of good tricks how do you do this logistically how do you find research assistance how do you actually connect with the tribe do you just show up and say ladies and gentlemen i will be living here for the next six months you probably don't do that so what do you do well uh as with so many things you gotta figure out the kind of uh relationship connections so while i was visiting the capitol i was pitching my project to a number of in a number of different offices in the fijian capital kind of national government offices and i met i think she was an assistant uh assistant secretary at the ministry of education and as i was describing my project to where i was suggesting places where she might or i might do some work and she mentioned that she had a uh uh an uncle there and so uh i thought well that's pretty interesting and so eventually i got her to write a letter for me introducing me to the uncle and then once i got to know i got there i talked to the uncle he seemed open to it and so kind of just making a chain of relationships i did the same thing with the mapuche in um in chile i had a friend who had a friend in santiago who had a woman who cleaned his house who had a cousin in the southern part of the country and i followed that chain of relationships into the into the community that's so exciting just sort of the unpredictability of it all that's really cool yeah you gotta just make it up as you go along uh just on the research assistant i just put up posters at the university of the south pacific and i did interviews like in in this little place i was staying i the term that you used earlier when i said that's a universal and another sort of universal that i would assume exists is when it comes to relationship building gift giving humor are those universals and what are the other universals that allow people to build trust to build liking with each other and to build community well um whether you know their true universals or just widespread is hard to say without kind of doing serious research but certainly gift giving pops up in lots of places ritual communal dancing um i mean drinking or some intoxicant is not a universal but it's certainly widespread and certainly used for lots of bonding um yeah so those are some of the things that come to mind and uh with gift giving like what in particular like for example like maybe there's sort of a margin where it actually has diminishing returns so like if i give you a small gift when i come to your house so say like you invite me over you're just outside of boston and i bring wine that probably helps our relationship but if i bring you a car you're probably like what are you trying to get from me right now and so you know it sort of changes the relationship right so it's not really just gift giving there's sort of these subtleties within it yeah and there's lots of customs and there's lots of places where people will reject gifts that are too large so it's exactly the case you is if someone gives you a gift too large in new guinea for example it's smart to reject it because if you accept it then you're going to owe a debt to that guy and and that debt is enforced by third parties so in our case probably no one would care and they would just think you're silly for giving me a car that i accepted uh but in other places my acceptance of that would constitute you know basically a long-term commitment to you to pay back that debt in some way and other people would care that i behaved properly in that way so i in that case i would reject it because i wouldn't want to incur that deep long-term debt yeah it's interesting with gifts so i have a lot of family in holland and in holland when we show up like it is a family rule we do not enter the house until we have a gift in our hands in a way that that's just not the case with my american yeah i mean i've that's very common in lots of places just to give you an example from my field work when i go to uh the communities that i study in the south pacific i always have to take cava so that's this root crop that you mix up and you drink out of a coconut cup gives a kind of mild narcotic effect numbs your tongue and stuff and that's just you know that's the required gift basically and i give that to the chief and i'm not allowed to move around the village until that gift has been delivered is it hard to get oh you just mark it and buy it it's there oh we're selling a lot of it yeah and um it's also i mean i uh the way you would buy it if you were just buying it to have a party with friends or something is just in a powdered form but i actually buy the big long roots which are the traditional way the gift is given in package so i'm giving this guy this big bouquet of roots and that they then have to pound up and in some sense it's like getting fresh coffee you get the fresh cava oh cool within narcotics kind of going into psychedelics you know a lot of people who are pro-psychedelics that i know they say look a lot of cultures around do psychedelics all the time and actually our american 2000 and or 21st century culture we're actually an anomaly for not doing psychedelics is that true false somewhere in the middle well i mean you'd have to again you'd have to do the research and kind of pull the numbers together it's certainly true uh that lots of societies use psychedelics so the matcha genga traditionally used ayahuasca um the communities i lived in didn't but there's another anthropologist who lived for years with the matcha genga uh in the remote communities of manu which is a national park in peru and there they were using ayahuasca and it was it was a common part of life and lots of shamanistic societies say i have a student who works in indonesia um you find that pretty widespread but then there's lots of societies that don't have it so uh you'd have to kind of tally them up i i think it would be less than 50 actually but not a lot less when it comes to convergence do you see times where there's issues of too much imitation of their what cultural imitation allows us to do is advance as a culture and you can almost think of like as a free riding in a good way but are there times where cultural limitation actually leads to really bad outcomes like say financial bubbles or something yeah and i think that's one of the powers of the theory is that the idea is that our capacities for learning from others evolve to be because they get us the right information they get us adaptive information on average in the kinds of environments we evolved in but it doesn't mean they always did that in the environments we evolved in and they especially don't always do that in the contemporary world so the kind of the most kind of interface striking example of this is what's called the demographic transition so since about 1870 the wealthier you are the fewer kids you have and the more education you have the fewer kids you have as a from a from a genetic fitness point of view that's highly maladaptive and so there's this weird uh so uh the things that are that people are copying and trying to emulate and stuff are exactly the things that lead them to have lower fitness from from a genetic perspective um so that's a case of of maladaptation you also see it in things like stock market bubbles and also the the nature of prestige in the modern world so you know we have this we can act because of media and stuff we can access these huge distributions of people uh and sometimes people get famous just because of luck or whatever and then uh they'll get copied by others but it's because we're cueing off the fact that others are paying attention to that person so you can get these bandwagon effects where initially there was some random event which brought someone into the public eye people looked at that person other people go look everyone's paying attention to that person they must be worth learning from so this is prestige bias transmission and then you can get the diffusion of maladaptive practices or just unusual practices yeah you know that's saying famous for being famous right right i i described that a little bit in in the chapter on prestige in my book how did kinship change once agriculture was introduced i mean i would guess that agriculture created property rights because you would actually be harvesting the land what else changed about familiar yeah so you put your finger on the uh i think a key idea which is that once you begin planting stuff in the ground you got to have access to that same land again when it when it's time to harvest you have to protect it from other people harvesting ahead of you so human society's cultural evolution needed to look for ways in which to guard the land in some sense and then eventually share production and distribution so you get the arises increasing the scale of the level of cooperation so because humans are a type of primate we have some basic instincts that revolve around kin-based altruism our incest aversion and our ability to pair bond which we share with gorillas and so uh i think cultural evolution harnessed these basic instincts and began to build uh additional or extend human institutions so small-scale foraging populations have these kin-based institutions and they help people to kind of stay connected over a vast network covering a lot of territory but as you get the beginning of agriculture these things kind of turn in on themselves and begin to consolidate cooperation to around plots of land essentially so you get the emergence of clans and kindreds and eventually various extensions of clans um so you get a more intensive set of kin-based institutions instead of the extensive institutions that we see amongst mobile foreigners so you mentioned a really interesting word here instinct and i would assume that human instinct doesn't change that much over time but i think that there's actually nuance in here that instinct can change and that's really interesting because there's something kind of contradictory about that so how does instinct begin to change once agriculture is introduced right so the idea is that we have an evolved psychology say for helping close relatives but culture can manipulate that so we have a sense of how we might want to treat our brother or our father or sister um and then what we see in kinship system after kinship system that evolved independ culturally evolved independently around the world is that we extend those categories to more distant relatives so in lots of societies there's a set of cousins that you would refer to as siblings and that carries with it all your intuitions about how you're supposed to treat them so you're supposed to treat them well and people can know that you didn't treat them well because they know well it's your brother you're supposed to treat him like a brother and also if it's a cross-sex relationship then there's no sex or marriage so that begins to define a set of relationships and if you have a patrilineal clan it means that all the women in the clan are effectively sisters often so you're not competing with the other men for the other women in the group and the men are brothers of various kinds and sometimes all the older males are fathers you know because you call your your father's brother uncle for example often in a patriarchal clan so it's extending some of these basic relationships now there's still norms in the sense that if you violate them other people will get mad at you but the idea is that we have some intuitions that come from these instincts and they can be extended to these other relationships and then you mentioned pair bonding earlier it seems like from my reading of your work monogamy is actually a relatively new standard to have so what happens with the introduction of monogamy it seems like it reduces a lot of the competition among men and sort of spreads out a lot of the reproductive success for men you know one of the things that i found to be very interesting is in the data from online dating apps how tall attractive men just do extremely well actually do better than attractive women a lot of the times and what you have is that men can go on these dating apps they can say basically anything and they will attract a ton of women and i think that that relates to monogamy because i would assume that in a pre-monogamous society you would a small percentage of men who were giving birth to the vast majority of people yeah and that's actually something that was so powerful that we think we can see it in the dna so you see a big crash in the frequency y chromosomes relative to x chromosomes after the origins of agriculture and that may correspond with the emergence of clans as the primary unit so groups of related males were banding together and they were becoming a kind of military force and they were wiping out other groups of y chromosomes uh and then taking lots of x chromosomes into their group uh which requires high levels of polygony or at least reasonable levels of polygony so uh so so but let me back up for a second so pair bonding doesn't imply monogamy this implies that a male and a female combine efforts for the purposes of reproduction but there's nothing that says you can't have multiple pair bonds so i mentioned guerrillas gorillas have pair bonds but big you know male silverback gorillas have multiple pair bonds and that means they have multiple dyadic relationships with female guerrillas uh the same we see the same thing in poliginous human societies there's no such thing as what was at least there's no evidence of group marriage in human societies but there's lots of evidence of various kinds of polygamy so men taking multiple wives is the usual form and there's a small scattering of societies where women sometimes take additional husbands maybe 0.1 percent and so what's rare is the kind of monogamy that we see in the modern world and this pops up occasionally amongst hunter-gatherers but it probably isn't normative in the sense that if the men were sufficiently different they could attract additional wives but if men are sufficiently equal there's not much to choose between and so you don't end up with men accumulating additional wives but even in relatively small scale ego alitarian foragers like in australia you can get men accumulating five or six wives so it's you know i guess it's like the dating app except with a smaller pool of fish um and then what so what's interesting is that in the western tradition uh probably beginning in athens uh before the classical period you begin to see the very beginning of monogamous marriage getting imposed where greek men were limited to only one athenian wife although they could have as many select sex slaves and other concubines and then christianity really doubles down on this and ends ends the sex slaves and concubines and then monogamous marriage begins to spread out as christianity spreads out across europe and then eventually around the let's see what from guns germs and steel did you take the most from yeah so uh that's definitely one of my favorite books and it's really inspired me over the years and i in my new book i make the case that diamond was essentially correct that these differences in biogeography across continents do help us to account for why eurasia has the most complex societies uh that develop the fanciest technology that have the the largest scale empires but that there's still a puzzle to be explained as to why europe took the path that it did and why after 1500 europeans expand around and so i think you know i for simplicity in my book i mark diamond as being roughly correct at about a year a thou 1 000. the com most complex societies do all appear in india the islamic world china are all powerful empires but then there's this backwater in europe uh around this time and that this eventually expands and you know becomes the dominant power a thousand years later and so the the question is why that so how do you explain variation within europe it's not that uh scotland or england or the netherlands were endowed with particularly good biogeography so you can't use the biogeography story there and so that's part of what my book's about well how much do you expect that to change over time because you mentioned some of the societies that succeeded and there seems to be a strong geographic component there but there's two things that stand out one sort of looking back 50 years one looking forward 50 years looking back 50 years what you have is the success of singapore geographically it's a huge anomaly most of the successful cities that we have are roughly between 20 35 degrees of what would it be latitude i think and then above the equator and then looking forward 50 years there's a really interesting theory that what remote work does is it will change the sort of epicenter of how humans coordinate from being on the same length on the equator to then being in the the same time zone so what you have is say that a lot of companies are based in america well it doesn't really make sense even though san francisco and like madrid spain are roughly the same number of degrees above the equator it makes a lot more sense not to hire for spain but to hire down in mexico because the time zone differences disappear so what i'm trying to get at here is what are some of the ways that a lot of the very naturalistic ideas of jared diamond are going to disappear or have disappeared already well yeah so i don't think uh well so the ideas of jared diamond are relevant in the sense that some populations derive from societies that have had agriculture in state level institutions for a long time and uh at least as long as there are states the states are the dominant political form those populations are going to have some advantage but you know i think we're going to see the same thing we've seen in the past where you have competition amongst groups large empires often expand and then collapse from the interior under their own weight often after they've eliminated most of the competition so there's going to be some new institutional forms which out-compete the old institutional forms there'll be some new psychologies associated with those they'll take the heritage of the prior institutions but then hold on them in some new and creative direction so the kind of thing you're describing is how new technologies are going to call for new institutional forms and one of the main points of my book is that i'll call for different different kinds of psychology it's really hard to look ahead uh over this over the millennia actually people who try to predict the future are almost always wrong so we shouldn't be huberistic about being able to predict the future easily although i think what we can predict is that there's going to be change in the future is not going to look like the present how much do you see moving on to religion here how much do you see religion as like an innate component in the human mind yeah so i very much think that in order to understand religion you have to begin with reliably developing features of mind so things like our capacity for mentalizing and uh the way that evolved it gives us the ability to to conceptualize mentalize agents that can have properties and beliefs and desires demands without having any kinds of bodies so it allows us to think about supernatural agents that have say special powers so that provides a kind of foundation and that's something that you know wasn't a design intended by natural selection as it was building human brains but it was a kind of byproduct that ended up there as it was building our minds to be better at learning from others so building up our theory theory of mind or mentalizing capacities so then the argument my colleagues and i have made is that cultural evolution grabs a hold of that and it begins selecting for supernatural agents who can get people to behave in more cooperative ways it allows their group to succeed in competition against other groups so increasing people's cooperation fostering greater solidarity within the group this can involve particular religious beliefs like you'll get punished if you're not if you're not nice to other members of your own group uh it could also involve the performance of rituals which create more bonding amongst the group so it's you know it helps answer the question is why gods are so interested in all these doing these rituals because it may bring people together and then foster the proliferation of beliefs in that supernatural age talk about rituals i mean i think that what you're saying here about them bringing people together is definitely one aspect how about some of common knowledge in society the way that creates shared beliefs and then allows coordination or takes something like fasting in the jewish tradition there's yom kippur and what that does presumably from reading the science fasting is really good for you and so there might be a lot of wisdom in the tradition of these rituals like another one is that i was home and i was with my dad and i was sucking the blood out of the off of the plate it was a buttery steak blood it was delicious and my dad said don't do that in the jewish tradition we do not drink the blood of animals and i started we're also mixing milk and you're also mixing milk and meat yeah exactly and there is likely a lot of wisdom behind that yeah so um yeah so rituals are our complex grab bag so i was i had in mind these um communal rituals where there's a lot of singing dancing celebration sometimes there's terrifying rituals and those have been decomposed by psychologists and show how the different parts of the ritual actually build greater solidarity there's another set of rituals kind of these devotional practices that you were talking about where people might repeatedly do prayers they might get up at dawn and pray towards mecca or something and that may increase our self-regulation so that could be favored by just a a plain old individual level copy of the successful people people who do that ritual get greater self-regulation and then they go on to prosper and other domains of their life because of the way the ritual builds this this capacity whereas the the rich the other rituals are more of a group thing so that gives the group more cooperation and allows them to proliferate so one of the things cultural evolutionary theory does is allows us to uh develop hypotheses about what the how these why these different cultural practices might have evolved and then figure out how to test them with data have you looked into rights of passage at all yeah so uh i personally haven't done research on that but there's a a very successful i think uh focus on in anthropology working with psychologists led by harvey whitehouse which harvey did some interesting work in new guinea uh which has many societies that engage in these terrifying rites of passage and then the idea is that if you go through a terrifying experience with a a peer say this bonds you this creates a tight psychological bond between you and the peer so we see this uh in the us for example in the band of brothers phenomena so when soldiers have experienced combat together they often form this lifelong tight bond and they'll you know they'll remain friends for life and what these terrifying rituals do is they take that piece of psychology which only gets activated in this case in war and put it into a ritual so that every generation gets bonded like a band of brothers and so it rebuilds the band of brothers every generation by the with a terrifying truth and that's recurrent across many societies in the anthropological record yeah i'm interested in these bonds one of the things that the dutch do is they basically throw children in the woods and make them find their way back home and obviously there's a lot of fraternity rituals that are very common traditionally in american culture and they're ridiculous just absolutely ridiculous and often funny but if you talk to people who've gone through them together they you can actually see the evidence of a close-knit relationship due to the way that they can share a laugh about those experiences and they can look at the other people and they can say you went through that i went through that basically no one else i know went through that right yes these these things do have real psychological effects um these days they can also for for for the societies i'm talking about all males have to go through them so it doesn't have this club-like effect but in other places where it's a voluntary membership then there's also a club-like thing like you know in order to get into this club you got to show your seriousness and in order to do that you're going to have to do this costly painful scary ritual before you can get in and it guarantees a kind of commitment to the group of seriousness about being in the group yeah you know what's funny so you know the adulting meme like hashtag adulting so what this is i don't what is it is uh basically it is very popular among sort of millennials and it's like i need to go wash the dishes i need to go clean my clothes hashtag adulting and it's sort of like this sort of playful thing of basically saying i don't feel like being an adult today but i'm gonna be proud of myself for being an adult today and it's sort of like this wow go me and it's born out of some accommodation of laziness and and and i think a lot of the coddling young people grew up with and what i find to be particularly interesting as we're talking about rituals is it doesn't seem like a lot of the coming of age rituals that have been in more traditional societies actually apply today and that there's no day where you just become an adult i mean in the jewish tradition i was bar mitzvahed at 13 years old and supposedly that meant that i was going to become an adult but i was too young at the time it didn't have that much significance what are the implications of us losing a lot of these coming-of-age rituals yeah that's an interesting question uh that i haven't thought much about certainly one thing that's happening in our society is kind of the amount of training you have to do so if you think about people going on for additional education or other kinds of training after high school there's kind of this extended adolescent period and then of course you know one obvious transition to more of an adult status would be marriage certainly having a child transitions you can transition pretty quickly but short of those we have no other marker uh for that and you know a lot fewer and fewer people are getting married we'll see we'll see how long that lasts but um uh yeah so that is interesting so i guess we get more extended adolescence period which could be good for creativity and there can be lots of positives to that so it's not obviously a terrible thing there's going to be costs and benefits i predict why would that be good for creativity well so you don't get burned down with a lot of adult tasks you have more time to go off and just think creatively about things or do things differently try new things that you wouldn't otherwise um once you start behaving like an adult of course you there's certain responsibilities you got to take your kid to basketball practice and ice hockey practice lots of tasks that don't require less creativity there's an idea from a book called einstein's dreams written by alan lightman and it's a series of dreams it's a fiction book that is sort of inspired by albert einstein and one of my favorite ideas is the difference between body time and mechanical time what body time is is it sort of the circadian flow of life i feel like doing this i feel like doing that eating here sleeping there whereas mechanical time is time that's very driven by what time it is right now i know it is 1 24 p.m i like to do a thought experiment with people to say when was the last time that you went an entire day without looking at the time and most people can't remember that what has the clock done to our psychology yeah i mean that's something i've thought a lot about and i really think that uh i mean so the clock appears 15th century 14th century and it begins diffusing through different european towns and it's kind of a prestige thing if you want to be a proper town you need a clock and then they attach bells to the clock so they can ring it every hour and then everything gets tied tightly to the clock so this really kind of created a new time psychology i mean i think there was already a sign of psychological push within european societies to regulate themselves so people were using candle lengths and hourglasses and all this to kind of chop the time up and you can think of it as an effort to kind of be more productive or use your time in a wise way this is tied up with religion monks were doing so i think it's very much changed the natural rhythms of the day that kind of govern humanity over most of our evolutionary history and began to make us more productive began to change how we think about the time wage labor pops up uh during the late medieval period so people begin to equate time and money so if you think about the western way of thinking about time we're always trying to save time or make time or buy time it's like it's a coinage and of course we get paid sometimes by the clock too so time is literally money or that hasn't been the case and and time ebbs and flows depending on how entertaining a situation is and people lose track of time for long periods and the day length is always changing so if you're going by sun up and sun down that's constantly stretching and moving across the ear so yeah i think these technologies have a big effect on how we think might change notions of patients in what way well uh the big thing is so we know from studies of other animals that we think logarithmically about time so you know we're it's more or less linear when we're thinking about things that are in the near future but things in the far future can seem uh you know much further away than they actually are so um when we when we learn to tell time using a clock the clock is a linear like the clock's aligned i mean they bend it into a circle but each hour is exactly the same distance apart so in can you know calendars you can look at calendars and all the days are the same distance apart the end of the month doesn't look further away than the beginning but that doesn't mesh with our kind of natural animal way of doing it so we're in some sense retraining ourselves to think about time as linear so the difference between you know 29 days from now and 30 days from now you know that's just one day but if we're thinking about that kind of intuitively that's just basically the same you know it's foreign some days in the future and moss or mayonnaise one day so it allows so it changes how we conceptualize time differences especially when thinking about the future yeah that's an interesting idea about how time no longer stretches or contracts so you would think that as the days get really long in the summer when it's hot that would biologically be a time where you work less where maybe the winter when this is very sort of a scandinavian idea in the winter you really kind of come close and you sort of bundle up with your friends and family but the clock doesn't have those swings and so it has a way of homogenizing every day yeah yeah and i think that is a big effect it makes the the annual cycle less important uh it means we don't we don't experience the annual cycle as much as we would uh in former times but before the clock and before we were kind of time obsessed so one of the things i do in the book is i i look at the kind of time obsession like you were saying how when was the last time you went a day without looking at the clock and you know very few people uh who you might interview here would would have gone today without looking closely at the whereas i when i was working in the south pacific with my fijian researcher assistants i had trouble getting them to look at their watches because they just weren't tuned into the clock the way i was constantly obsessed with the clock and i would actually bought them watches and as an encouragement so we could we could run a little bit more efficiently but it took some practice before we got that working and if you were to say like if you were to argue for the wisdom in that perspective what would it be well i i mean i'm totally uh i think there's a lot of wisdom in not tuning into the clock so i kind of uh have uh kind of wish i could become more like my my fijian friends who can you can disconnect from the clock so i think it's a good um discipline or a good devotional it would be a good devotional ritual to just shut off all your clocks or something and go a day with no clock time just to see how it feels and remember how it feels i agree man i think it's good to be able to rant yeah i think it'd be really fun it's almost as if it's like the new on the road you know like in the 1960s people got on the road and or went into the wild and they they went across the country to do something crazy like that maybe the new the new one is just to get away from time and the way that it demands productivity from you the way that it tries to get you to squeeze time out of every single day when i first asked the question you said i've thought a lot about that what drew you to this idea well so the main thing is i was thinking about the changes in people's psychology in europe over the last millennium and uh i know there's this rise in individualism there's also a rise in the times people spent working and also you have this massive diffusion of mechanical clocks that's occurring and there's a couple things that that struck me as the mechanical clock spread rapidly throughout europe but it could have easily spread um to istanbul and throughout the islamic world these societies were well aware of the clock they were connected to europe um and it didn't didn't spread there so there's just something uninteresting about the clock and you know eventually europeans take the clock to asia and it just doesn't catch on but europeans were obsessed with getting that clock and so i think it's a marker of a difference in psychology and really the importance of so if you look at individualism and how fast people walk on the street there's a strong correlation so more individualistic societies if you just stand quietly by and put a stopwatch on people as they walk you know 50 meters or something on the sidewalks of new york city or somewhere like that they're walking faster so people in individualistic societies are just you know they're more kids i gotta get 01:0:0,069 --> 01:0:2,480 01:0:0,079 --> 01:0:4,880 there i gotta be on time 01:0:2,470 --> 01:0:4,880 01:0:2,480 --> 01:0:5,920 have you looked into mirrors at all like 01:0:4,870 --> 01:0:5,920 01:0:4,880 --> 01:0:10,480 you know there's the 01:0:5,910 --> 01:0:10,480 01:0:5,920 --> 01:0:12,799 famous myth of narcissist and 01:0:10,470 --> 01:0:12,799 01:0:10,480 --> 01:0:14,240 mirrors you know it's funny so i'm 01:0:12,789 --> 01:0:14,240 01:0:12,799 --> 01:0:17,520 living at this house and 01:0:14,230 --> 01:0:17,520 01:0:14,240 --> 01:0:20,079 we have a backyard gym and 01:0:17,510 --> 01:0:20,079 01:0:17,520 --> 01:0:21,119 you know why the backyard gym is amazing 01:0:20,069 --> 01:0:21,119 01:0:20,079 --> 01:0:23,359 because 01:0:21,109 --> 01:0:23,359 01:0:21,119 --> 01:0:24,480 it is up against the window and the 01:0:23,349 --> 01:0:24,480 01:0:23,359 --> 01:0:27,200 reflection 01:0:24,470 --> 01:0:27,200 01:0:24,480 --> 01:0:29,440 that you get when you work out makes you 01:0:27,190 --> 01:0:29,440 01:0:27,200 --> 01:0:30,559 go way harder and it makes you lift 01:0:29,430 --> 01:0:30,559 01:0:29,440 --> 01:0:32,079 heavier weights 01:0:30,549 --> 01:0:32,079 01:0:30,559 --> 01:0:34,160 and i've spent the last couple months 01:0:32,069 --> 01:0:34,160 01:0:32,079 --> 01:0:36,799 working out not in front of a mirror 01:0:34,150 --> 01:0:36,799 01:0:34,160 --> 01:0:39,760 and i will tell you boy is it a 01:0:36,789 --> 01:0:39,760 01:0:36,799 --> 01:0:39,760 different experience 01:0:39,910 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:0:39,920 --> 01:0:42,480 that's interesting no i haven't thought 01:0:41,349 --> 01:0:42,480 01:0:41,359 --> 01:0:43,599 about the mirror the mirror isn't 01:0:42,470 --> 01:0:43,599 01:0:42,480 --> 01:0:45,359 interesting 01:0:43,589 --> 01:0:45,359 01:0:43,599 --> 01:0:46,880 uh i like it because it's a good marker 01:0:45,349 --> 01:0:46,880 01:0:45,359 --> 01:0:49,119 too it's easier to track 01:0:46,870 --> 01:0:49,119 01:0:46,880 --> 01:0:50,960 physical objects than psychology so 01:0:49,109 --> 01:0:50,960 01:0:49,119 --> 01:0:52,880 that's interesting 01:0:50,950 --> 01:0:52,880 01:0:50,960 --> 01:0:54,880 i'll also have to put a mirror in my gym 01:0:52,870 --> 01:0:54,880 01:0:52,880 --> 01:0:56,319 now that you mentioned 01:0:54,870 --> 01:0:56,319 01:0:54,880 --> 01:0:58,000 usually i try to get away from mirrors 01:0:56,309 --> 01:0:58,000 01:0:56,319 --> 01:0:59,599 but you know if they help 01:0:57,990 --> 01:0:59,599 01:0:58,000 --> 01:1:2,240 yeah it was funny i remember i went to 01:0:59,589 --> 01:1:2,240 01:0:59,599 --> 01:1:5,599 go visit my sister at uc davis and their 01:1:2,230 --> 01:1:5,599 01:1:2,240 --> 01:1:6,400 gym it was a temporary gym and it didn't 01:1:5,589 --> 01:1:6,400 01:1:5,599 --> 01:1:8,960 have a mirror 01:1:6,390 --> 01:1:8,960 01:1:6,400 --> 01:1:10,240 and it drove me crazy and where i was 01:1:8,950 --> 01:1:10,240 01:1:8,960 --> 01:1:12,240 working out in new york it's just 01:1:10,230 --> 01:1:12,240 01:1:10,240 --> 01:1:14,960 covered wall-to-wall with mirrors 01:1:12,230 --> 01:1:14,960 01:1:12,240 --> 01:1:15,599 and it is such a different experience if 01:1:14,950 --> 01:1:15,599 01:1:14,960 --> 01:1:19,200 you can just 01:1:15,589 --> 01:1:19,200 01:1:15,599 --> 01:1:22,079 look at yourself and you can say 01:1:19,190 --> 01:1:22,079 01:1:19,200 --> 01:1:23,599 look better and sort of be look at 01:1:22,069 --> 01:1:23,599 01:1:22,079 --> 01:1:25,359 yourself even as you're tired and you 01:1:23,589 --> 01:1:25,359 01:1:23,599 --> 01:1:27,359 can almost like build this relationship 01:1:25,349 --> 01:1:27,359 01:1:25,359 --> 01:1:27,920 with yourself it's a very subtle point 01:1:27,349 --> 01:1:27,920 01:1:27,359 --> 01:1:31,359 but 01:1:27,910 --> 01:1:31,359 01:1:27,920 --> 01:1:34,480 i can't imagine what it would be like 01:1:31,349 --> 01:1:34,480 01:1:31,359 --> 01:1:37,440 to live now without mirrors and 01:1:34,470 --> 01:1:37,440 01:1:34,480 --> 01:1:38,079 likewise to live without photos i mean 01:1:37,430 --> 01:1:38,079 01:1:37,440 --> 01:1:41,440 look at what 01:1:38,069 --> 01:1:41,440 01:1:38,079 --> 01:1:45,280 photography has done to raise the status 01:1:41,430 --> 01:1:45,280 01:1:41,440 --> 01:1:49,040 of beauty in certain ways 01:1:45,270 --> 01:1:49,040 01:1:45,280 --> 01:1:52,079 it's it's really a change in culture 01:1:49,030 --> 01:1:52,079 01:1:49,040 --> 01:1:53,200 yeah yeah i mean that's one of the 01:1:52,069 --> 01:1:53,200 01:1:52,079 --> 01:1:54,799 things about field work 01:1:53,190 --> 01:1:54,799 01:1:53,200 --> 01:1:56,480 although i don't get away from the time 01:1:54,789 --> 01:1:56,480 01:1:54,799 --> 01:1:58,319 because i'm still wearing watches you do 01:1:56,470 --> 01:1:58,319 01:1:56,480 --> 01:1:59,680 get away from mirrors so it does strike 01:1:58,309 --> 01:1:59,680 01:1:58,319 --> 01:2:3,039 you after several months that you 01:1:59,670 --> 01:2:3,039 01:1:59,680 --> 01:2:6,400 haven't looked in a mirror for that long 01:2:3,029 --> 01:2:6,400 01:2:3,039 --> 01:2:10,079 um i was looking 01:2:6,390 --> 01:2:10,079 01:2:6,400 --> 01:2:11,440 at booms and creativity throughout human 01:2:10,069 --> 01:2:11,440 01:2:10,079 --> 01:2:16,319 history over the weekend 01:2:11,430 --> 01:2:16,319 01:2:11,440 --> 01:2:19,760 and one thing that seems to be true 01:2:16,309 --> 01:2:19,760 01:2:16,319 --> 01:2:21,200 is that when there are these explosions 01:2:19,750 --> 01:2:21,200 01:2:19,760 --> 01:2:24,240 in creativity 01:2:21,190 --> 01:2:24,240 01:2:21,200 --> 01:2:27,039 athens florence london 01:2:24,230 --> 01:2:27,039 01:2:24,240 --> 01:2:28,079 vienna edinburgh in the 18th century 01:2:27,029 --> 01:2:28,079 01:2:27,039 --> 01:2:30,480 they seem to be 01:2:28,069 --> 01:2:30,480 01:2:28,079 --> 01:2:32,559 very concentrated around the liberal 01:2:30,470 --> 01:2:32,559 01:2:30,480 --> 01:2:34,720 arts more than stem 01:2:32,549 --> 01:2:34,720 01:2:32,559 --> 01:2:36,240 and they like when you look at florence 01:2:34,710 --> 01:2:36,240 01:2:34,720 --> 01:2:39,039 you see painting 01:2:36,230 --> 01:2:39,039 01:2:36,240 --> 01:2:40,480 when you look at athens you see poetry 01:2:39,029 --> 01:2:40,480 01:2:39,039 --> 01:2:41,760 and philosophy 01:2:40,470 --> 01:2:41,760 01:2:40,480 --> 01:2:44,000 what do you think it is about the 01:2:41,750 --> 01:2:44,000 01:2:41,760 --> 01:2:45,119 clustering of people and the way that 01:2:43,990 --> 01:2:45,119 01:2:44,000 --> 01:2:49,839 that boosts 01:2:45,109 --> 01:2:49,839 01:2:45,119 --> 01:2:49,839 the liberal arts more than stem 01:2:50,470 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:2:50,480 --> 01:2:54,400 well i definitely you know i have these 01:2:52,630 --> 01:2:54,400 01:2:52,640 --> 01:2:56,400 ideas about the collective brain 01:2:54,390 --> 01:2:56,400 01:2:54,400 --> 01:2:58,400 and i think that people begin to feed 01:2:56,390 --> 01:2:58,400 01:2:56,400 --> 01:3:0,079 rapidly off of each other and so you can 01:2:58,390 --> 01:3:0,079 01:2:58,400 --> 01:3:1,440 get these nice clusterings of people 01:3:0,069 --> 01:3:1,440 01:3:0,079 --> 01:3:2,799 sharing lots of ideas 01:3:1,430 --> 01:3:2,799 01:3:1,440 --> 01:3:4,400 and usually you'll find out that these 01:3:2,789 --> 01:3:4,400 01:3:2,799 --> 01:3:5,839 clusters are actually connected to lots 01:3:4,390 --> 01:3:5,839 01:3:4,400 --> 01:3:8,400 of other clusters 01:3:5,829 --> 01:3:8,400 01:3:5,839 --> 01:3:9,680 that are you know further away but i'm 01:3:8,390 --> 01:3:9,680 01:3:8,400 --> 01:3:12,079 wondering about the 01:3:9,670 --> 01:3:12,079 01:3:9,680 --> 01:3:13,760 the empirical claim because sometimes 01:3:12,069 --> 01:3:13,760 01:3:12,079 --> 01:3:15,039 the mechanical stuff goes on in the 01:3:13,750 --> 01:3:15,039 01:3:13,760 --> 01:3:17,440 background 01:3:15,029 --> 01:3:17,440 01:3:15,039 --> 01:3:18,960 and what we know is because the arts 01:3:17,430 --> 01:3:18,960 01:3:17,440 --> 01:3:19,760 people write a lot of books right so we 01:3:18,950 --> 01:3:19,760 01:3:18,960 --> 01:3:21,839 01:3:19,750 --> 01:3:21,839 01:3:19,760 --> 01:3:23,359 times and date stamps because we have 01:3:21,829 --> 01:3:23,359 01:3:21,839 --> 01:3:24,799 book manuscripts 01:3:23,349 --> 01:3:24,799 01:3:23,359 --> 01:3:26,640 but i wonder if there's actually some of 01:3:24,789 --> 01:3:26,640 01:3:24,799 --> 01:3:28,000 the mechanical stuff is going on quietly 01:3:26,630 --> 01:3:28,000 01:3:26,640 --> 01:3:30,079 in the shops and 01:3:27,990 --> 01:3:30,079 01:3:28,000 --> 01:3:32,160 uh elsewhere because i mean so edinboro 01:3:30,069 --> 01:3:32,160 01:3:30,079 --> 01:3:35,760 of course that was the home of lots of 01:3:32,150 --> 01:3:35,760 01:3:32,160 --> 01:3:36,319 innovators james watt being one glasgow 01:3:35,750 --> 01:3:36,319 01:3:35,760 --> 01:3:39,200 yeah 01:3:36,309 --> 01:3:39,200 01:3:36,319 --> 01:3:40,720 yep exactly god the collective brain is 01:3:39,190 --> 01:3:40,720 01:3:39,200 --> 01:3:42,640 such a fun idea and 01:3:40,710 --> 01:3:42,640 01:3:40,720 --> 01:3:44,240 what's weird to me about it is i feel 01:3:42,630 --> 01:3:44,240 01:3:42,640 --> 01:3:46,960 like we don't acknowledge it 01:3:44,230 --> 01:3:46,960 01:3:44,240 --> 01:3:48,319 as a society so i mean i teach writing 01:3:46,950 --> 01:3:48,319 01:3:46,960 --> 01:3:49,760 and one of the things that my 01:3:48,309 --> 01:3:49,760 01:3:48,319 --> 01:3:52,559 students are obsessed with is 01:3:49,750 --> 01:3:52,559 01:3:49,760 --> 01:3:56,720 originality and originality stands 01:3:52,549 --> 01:3:56,720 01:3:52,559 --> 01:3:58,799 so in contrast to the collective brain 01:3:56,710 --> 01:3:58,799 01:3:56,720 --> 01:4:0,160 right but when you dig deep into things 01:3:58,789 --> 01:4:0,160 01:3:58,799 --> 01:4:1,359 you find out that almost everything is a 01:4:0,150 --> 01:4:1,359 01:4:0,160 --> 01:4:3,039 recombination 01:4:1,349 --> 01:4:3,039 01:4:1,359 --> 01:4:4,400 so that's always a fun game as you take 01:4:3,029 --> 01:4:4,400 01:4:3,039 --> 01:4:6,319 an invention and say 01:4:4,390 --> 01:4:6,319 01:4:4,400 --> 01:4:7,680 okay where do these ideas come from and 01:4:6,309 --> 01:4:7,680 01:4:6,319 --> 01:4:9,119 you begin looking around 01:4:7,670 --> 01:4:9,119 01:4:7,680 --> 01:4:10,480 and then you find out they got this bit 01:4:9,109 --> 01:4:10,480 01:4:9,119 --> 01:4:11,280 from here and they got that bit from 01:4:10,470 --> 01:4:11,280 01:4:10,480 --> 01:4:12,880 there 01:4:11,270 --> 01:4:12,880 01:4:11,280 --> 01:4:15,200 and then often the two guys or two 01:4:12,870 --> 01:4:15,200 01:4:12,880 --> 01:4:17,119 people turn out to know each other 01:4:15,190 --> 01:4:17,119 01:4:15,200 --> 01:4:18,640 um there's it's interest it's so fun to 01:4:17,109 --> 01:4:18,640 01:4:17,119 --> 01:4:19,359 track the social networks of all these 01:4:18,630 --> 01:4:19,359 01:4:18,640 --> 01:4:21,680 ideas 01:4:19,349 --> 01:4:21,680 01:4:19,359 --> 01:4:23,280 so you're talking about scotland i mean 01:4:21,670 --> 01:4:23,280 01:4:21,680 --> 01:4:24,960 you know you got david hume and adam 01:4:23,270 --> 01:4:24,960 01:4:23,280 --> 01:4:26,319 smith and all those guys they're all 01:4:24,950 --> 01:4:26,319 01:4:24,960 --> 01:4:28,640 like friends right i mean they're 01:4:26,309 --> 01:4:28,640 01:4:26,319 --> 01:4:30,559 interacting and reading each other and 01:4:28,630 --> 01:4:30,559 01:4:28,640 --> 01:4:32,000 all that kind of stuff j.r tolkien at 01:4:30,549 --> 01:4:32,000 01:4:30,559 --> 01:4:35,119 c.s lewis 01:4:31,990 --> 01:4:35,119 01:4:32,000 --> 01:4:35,680 oh right okay yeah so that that is 01:4:35,109 --> 01:4:35,680 01:4:35,119 --> 01:4:38,480 always 01:4:35,670 --> 01:4:38,480 01:4:35,680 --> 01:4:40,799 uh i i well i'm sure the historians know 01:4:38,470 --> 01:4:40,799 01:4:38,480 --> 01:4:43,039 about this but i'm always impressed 01:4:40,789 --> 01:4:43,039 01:4:40,799 --> 01:4:44,799 and surprised by uh the degree of 01:4:43,029 --> 01:4:44,799 01:4:43,039 --> 01:4:46,160 personal relationships between 01:4:44,789 --> 01:4:46,160 01:4:44,799 --> 01:4:47,520 a lot of the inventors during these 01:4:46,150 --> 01:4:47,520 01:4:46,160 --> 01:4:48,960 times and places and how much they 01:4:47,510 --> 01:4:48,960 01:4:47,520 --> 01:4:51,520 actually knew each other 01:4:48,950 --> 01:4:51,520 01:4:48,960 --> 01:4:52,640 and were reading each other um so then 01:4:51,510 --> 01:4:52,640 01:4:51,520 --> 01:4:54,799 as a so like 01:4:52,630 --> 01:4:54,799 01:4:52,640 --> 01:4:56,480 darwin was inspired by lyle but he was 01:4:54,789 --> 01:4:56,480 01:4:54,799 --> 01:4:57,440 actually buddies with lyle you know the 01:4:56,470 --> 01:4:57,440 01:4:56,480 --> 01:5:1,920 the geology 01:4:57,430 --> 01:5:1,920 01:4:57,440 --> 01:5:5,599 geologist so as a society it seems like 01:5:1,910 --> 01:5:5,599 01:5:1,920 --> 01:5:6,880 originality is overrated or something 01:5:5,589 --> 01:5:6,880 01:5:5,599 --> 01:5:10,160 like that but it's 01:5:6,870 --> 01:5:10,160 01:5:6,880 --> 01:5:12,960 very odd to me that we value it so 01:5:10,150 --> 01:5:12,960 01:5:10,160 --> 01:5:13,359 highly if like you said everything has 01:5:12,950 --> 01:5:13,359 01:5:12,960 --> 01:5:16,559 01:5:13,349 --> 01:5:16,559 01:5:13,359 --> 01:5:18,720 remixed qualities and once you 01:5:16,549 --> 01:5:18,720 01:5:16,559 --> 01:5:20,640 actually begin to create things yourself 01:5:18,710 --> 01:5:20,640 01:5:18,720 --> 01:5:22,240 i texted a guy today i was like hey i 01:5:20,630 --> 01:5:22,240 01:5:20,640 --> 01:5:24,720 loved your essay on 01:5:22,230 --> 01:5:24,720 01:5:22,240 --> 01:5:26,240 cenius and he said oh thanks i really 01:5:24,710 --> 01:5:26,240 01:5:24,720 --> 01:5:26,960 just combined all these other people's 01:5:26,230 --> 01:5:26,960 01:5:26,240 --> 01:5:28,799 01:5:26,950 --> 01:5:28,799 01:5:26,960 --> 01:5:30,799 and like once you start creating you're 01:5:28,789 --> 01:5:30,799 01:5:28,799 --> 01:5:32,480 like of course but there's this weird 01:5:30,789 --> 01:5:32,480 01:5:30,799 --> 01:5:33,599 effect of being a consumer of something 01:5:32,470 --> 01:5:33,599 01:5:32,480 --> 01:5:36,880 where things seem 01:5:33,589 --> 01:5:36,880 01:5:33,599 --> 01:5:37,760 way more original than they are yeah and 01:5:36,870 --> 01:5:37,760 01:5:36,880 --> 01:5:40,079 i think that's a 01:5:37,750 --> 01:5:40,079 01:5:37,760 --> 01:5:40,880 that's in part a cultural model we have 01:5:40,069 --> 01:5:40,880 01:5:40,079 --> 01:5:43,520 01:5:40,870 --> 01:5:43,520 01:5:40,880 --> 01:5:44,240 the heroic inventor where we tend to see 01:5:43,510 --> 01:5:44,240 01:5:43,520 --> 01:5:46,640 things as 01:5:44,230 --> 01:5:46,640 01:5:44,240 --> 01:5:47,839 produced by a given mind when that's 01:5:46,630 --> 01:5:47,839 01:5:46,640 --> 01:5:49,440 true to some degree but of course 01:5:47,829 --> 01:5:49,440 01:5:47,839 --> 01:5:50,240 there's a bunch of other minds feeding 01:5:49,430 --> 01:5:50,240 01:5:49,440 --> 01:5:51,920 into that 01:5:50,230 --> 01:5:51,920 01:5:50,240 --> 01:5:53,520 invention and i think one good 01:5:51,910 --> 01:5:53,520 01:5:51,920 --> 01:5:56,960 illustration of this is the 01:5:53,510 --> 01:5:56,960 01:5:53,520 --> 01:5:57,440 is the how common uh sing or double 01:5:56,950 --> 01:5:57,440 01:5:56,960 --> 01:5:59,599 triple 01:5:57,430 --> 01:5:59,599 01:5:57,440 --> 01:6:1,680 quadruple invention is so there's almost 01:5:59,589 --> 01:6:1,680 01:5:59,599 --> 01:6:4,000 like there's a set of ideas 01:6:1,670 --> 01:6:4,000 01:6:1,680 --> 01:6:5,039 milling around and individuals are all 01:6:3,990 --> 01:6:5,039 01:6:4,000 --> 01:6:6,400 going to start putting it together 01:6:5,029 --> 01:6:6,400 01:6:5,039 --> 01:6:8,559 simultaneously so 01:6:6,390 --> 01:6:8,559 01:6:6,400 --> 01:6:10,240 you know darwin famously needs to 01:6:8,549 --> 01:6:10,240 01:6:8,559 --> 01:6:11,520 publish on natural selection because he 01:6:10,230 --> 01:6:11,520 01:6:10,240 --> 01:6:14,160 finds out that wallace 01:6:11,510 --> 01:6:14,160 01:6:11,520 --> 01:6:14,799 has figured out natural selection uh and 01:6:14,150 --> 01:6:14,799 01:6:14,160 --> 01:6:17,200 you know 01:6:14,789 --> 01:6:17,200 01:6:14,799 --> 01:6:18,799 you know newton does calculus one way 01:6:17,190 --> 01:6:18,799 01:6:17,200 --> 01:6:19,760 but leibniz figures out a better way to 01:6:18,789 --> 01:6:19,760 01:6:18,799 --> 01:6:21,599 do calculus 01:6:19,750 --> 01:6:21,599 01:6:19,760 --> 01:6:22,960 and they both invented it we think the 01:6:21,589 --> 01:6:22,960 01:6:21,599 --> 01:6:25,359 same time independently 01:6:22,950 --> 01:6:25,359 01:6:22,960 --> 01:6:27,760 and that's you know that this history of 01:6:25,349 --> 01:6:27,760 01:6:25,359 --> 01:6:29,920 invention is replete with that 01:6:27,750 --> 01:6:29,920 01:6:27,760 --> 01:6:31,520 what do you see in terms of it seems 01:6:29,910 --> 01:6:31,520 01:6:29,920 --> 01:6:32,559 like you need the right amount of 01:6:31,510 --> 01:6:32,559 01:6:31,520 --> 01:6:34,720 cooperation 01:6:32,549 --> 01:6:34,720 01:6:32,559 --> 01:6:36,240 to allow people to exchange ideas but 01:6:34,710 --> 01:6:36,240 01:6:34,720 --> 01:6:40,079 competition to 01:6:36,230 --> 01:6:40,079 01:6:36,240 --> 01:6:40,400 motivate each other yeah and so that is 01:6:40,069 --> 01:6:40,400 01:6:40,079 --> 01:6:42,480 01:6:40,390 --> 01:6:42,480 01:6:40,400 --> 01:6:44,160 difficult part of things like 01:6:42,470 --> 01:6:44,160 01:6:42,480 --> 01:6:45,599 intellectual property rights 01:6:44,150 --> 01:6:45,599 01:6:44,160 --> 01:6:47,200 because if you give someone a patent on 01:6:45,589 --> 01:6:47,200 01:6:45,599 --> 01:6:48,400 something then you're preventing other 01:6:47,190 --> 01:6:48,400 01:6:47,200 --> 01:6:51,920 people from putting that 01:6:48,390 --> 01:6:51,920 01:6:48,400 --> 01:6:53,440 technology those ideas to use for free 01:6:51,910 --> 01:6:53,440 01:6:51,920 --> 01:6:55,520 so you want to create incentives for 01:6:53,430 --> 01:6:55,520 01:6:53,440 --> 01:6:56,000 individuals to do stuff but at the same 01:6:55,510 --> 01:6:56,000 01:6:55,520 --> 01:6:58,240 01:6:55,990 --> 01:6:58,240 01:6:56,000 --> 01:6:59,359 you don't want to constrain the 01:6:58,230 --> 01:6:59,359 01:6:58,240 --> 01:7:1,119 collective brain 01:6:59,349 --> 01:7:1,119 01:6:59,359 --> 01:7:3,039 so patents that are too long are 01:7:1,109 --> 01:7:3,039 01:7:1,119 --> 01:7:4,799 probably a big mistake because they'll 01:7:3,029 --> 01:7:4,799 01:7:3,039 --> 01:7:6,160 uh they'll prevent the recombination of 01:7:4,789 --> 01:7:6,160 01:7:4,799 --> 01:7:9,520 those ideas with other 01:7:6,150 --> 01:7:9,520 01:7:6,160 --> 01:7:10,960 things so yeah one way to pay people is 01:7:9,510 --> 01:7:10,960 01:7:9,520 --> 01:7:13,359 just in the in the 01:7:10,950 --> 01:7:13,359 01:7:10,960 --> 01:7:15,039 prestige and the status of figuring 01:7:13,349 --> 01:7:15,039 01:7:13,359 --> 01:7:16,640 something new out but then i'll let the 01:7:15,029 --> 01:7:16,640 01:7:15,039 --> 01:7:19,359 let the ideas immediately 01:7:16,630 --> 01:7:19,359 01:7:16,640 --> 01:7:21,200 be taken up by others and put to work us 01:7:19,349 --> 01:7:21,200 01:7:19,359 --> 01:7:22,720 but it's so it's tricky 01:7:21,190 --> 01:7:22,720 01:7:21,200 --> 01:7:25,520 so by that do you mean so you got to get 01:7:22,710 --> 01:7:25,520 01:7:22,720 --> 01:7:26,880 right so i think there's been a bias to 01:7:25,510 --> 01:7:26,880 01:7:25,520 --> 01:7:28,400 assume you've got to create individual 01:7:26,870 --> 01:7:28,400 01:7:26,880 --> 01:7:29,520 incentives and there's probably 01:7:28,390 --> 01:7:29,520 01:7:28,400 --> 01:7:30,960 something to that i'm not 01:7:29,510 --> 01:7:30,960 01:7:29,520 --> 01:7:33,520 i don't think that individual incentives 01:7:30,950 --> 01:7:33,520 01:7:30,960 --> 01:7:35,599 are useless meaning monetary incentives 01:7:33,510 --> 01:7:35,599 01:7:33,520 --> 01:7:37,119 uh but you got to make sure you don't 01:7:35,589 --> 01:7:37,119 01:7:35,599 --> 01:7:38,640 close off the collective brain because 01:7:37,109 --> 01:7:38,640 01:7:37,119 --> 01:7:39,839 that's the really that's i think that's 01:7:38,630 --> 01:7:39,839 01:7:38,640 --> 01:7:41,280 the more important thing the more 01:7:39,829 --> 01:7:41,280 01:7:39,839 --> 01:7:42,799 driving thing so there's been 01:7:41,270 --> 01:7:42,799 01:7:41,280 --> 01:7:44,480 lots of places that have flourished you 01:7:42,789 --> 01:7:44,480 01:7:42,799 --> 01:7:45,359 just named some of them with no patent 01:7:44,470 --> 01:7:45,359 01:7:44,480 --> 01:7:47,520 law at all 01:7:45,349 --> 01:7:47,520 01:7:45,359 --> 01:7:48,799 no no copyright nothing but yet they had 01:7:47,510 --> 01:7:48,799 01:7:47,520 --> 01:7:50,559 this big proliferation 01:7:48,789 --> 01:7:50,559 01:7:48,799 --> 01:7:51,920 so we know we can get that even without 01:7:50,549 --> 01:7:51,920 01:7:50,559 --> 01:7:53,920 copyrights and patent law 01:7:51,910 --> 01:7:53,920 01:7:51,920 --> 01:7:54,960 the question is can we get it even more 01:7:53,910 --> 01:7:54,960 01:7:53,920 --> 01:7:57,119 if we have we 01:7:54,950 --> 01:7:57,119 01:7:54,960 --> 01:7:58,880 tune these little uh formal institutions 01:7:57,109 --> 01:7:58,880 01:7:57,119 --> 01:8:2,000 just right 01:7:58,870 --> 01:8:2,000 01:7:58,880 --> 01:8:5,200 how much do you think innovation is 01:8:1,990 --> 01:8:5,200 01:8:2,000 --> 01:8:6,960 constrained by access to information and 01:8:5,190 --> 01:8:6,960 01:8:5,200 --> 01:8:8,880 i'm gonna i don't know that i agree with 01:8:6,950 --> 01:8:8,880 01:8:6,960 --> 01:8:12,319 this but i'm just gonna argue here 01:8:8,870 --> 01:8:12,319 01:8:8,880 --> 01:8:12,640 that it is actually less constrained by 01:8:12,309 --> 01:8:12,640 01:8:12,319 --> 01:8:14,559 01:8:12,630 --> 01:8:14,559 01:8:12,640 --> 01:8:15,760 than we thought 20 years ago and the 01:8:14,549 --> 01:8:15,760 01:8:14,559 --> 01:8:19,120 reason i say that 01:8:15,750 --> 01:8:19,120 01:8:15,760 --> 01:8:21,199 is because if 01:8:19,110 --> 01:8:21,199 01:8:19,120 --> 01:8:23,120 access to information was really the 01:8:21,189 --> 01:8:23,120 01:8:21,199 --> 01:8:27,279 thing wouldn't you just see an 01:8:23,110 --> 01:8:27,279 01:8:23,120 --> 01:8:29,600 absolute explosion like exponential 01:8:27,269 --> 01:8:29,600 01:8:27,279 --> 01:8:31,199 we've never seen anything like this 01:8:29,590 --> 01:8:31,199 01:8:29,600 --> 01:8:33,679 increase in human progress in the last 01:8:31,189 --> 01:8:33,679 01:8:31,199 --> 01:8:33,679 20 years 01:8:34,149 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:8:34,159 --> 01:8:38,239 um so you mean that in order to create 01:8:37,030 --> 01:8:38,239 01:8:37,040 --> 01:8:41,600 new stuff you need 01:8:38,229 --> 01:8:41,600 01:8:38,239 --> 01:8:42,520 access to uh more information yeah but i 01:8:41,590 --> 01:8:42,520 01:8:41,600 --> 01:8:45,600 think that we've 01:8:42,510 --> 01:8:45,600 01:8:42,520 --> 01:8:47,440 overestimated how much that's true you 01:8:45,590 --> 01:8:47,440 01:8:45,600 --> 01:8:48,880 know like if you look at the 1990s 01:8:47,430 --> 01:8:48,880 01:8:47,440 --> 01:8:49,600 predictions of what the internet was 01:8:48,870 --> 01:8:49,600 01:8:48,880 --> 01:8:52,960 going to do the 01:8:49,590 --> 01:8:52,960 01:8:49,600 --> 01:8:53,440 information superhighway and you were to 01:8:52,950 --> 01:8:53,440 01:8:52,960 --> 01:8:56,400 say 01:8:53,430 --> 01:8:56,400 01:8:53,440 --> 01:8:57,440 you were going to have more information 01:8:56,390 --> 01:8:57,440 01:8:56,400 --> 01:9:0,880 in your pocket for 01:8:57,430 --> 01:9:0,880 01:8:57,440 --> 01:9:3,920 free than any us president before 01:9:0,870 --> 01:9:3,920 01:9:0,880 --> 01:9:5,040 say 1980. more information in your 01:9:3,910 --> 01:9:5,040 01:9:3,920 --> 01:9:7,120 pocket for free 01:9:5,030 --> 01:9:7,120 01:9:5,040 --> 01:9:8,319 than was in the entirety of the library 01:9:7,110 --> 01:9:8,319 01:9:7,120 --> 01:9:9,880 of alexandria 01:9:8,309 --> 01:9:9,880 01:9:8,319 --> 01:9:11,679 there's been something very 01:9:9,870 --> 01:9:11,679 01:9:9,880 --> 01:9:13,520 disappointing about 01:9:11,669 --> 01:9:13,520 01:9:11,679 --> 01:9:16,239 the rate of progress assuming that 01:9:13,510 --> 01:9:16,239 01:9:13,520 --> 01:9:16,239 that's true 01:9:16,309 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:9:16,319 --> 01:9:20,480 right right yeah i think it's difficult 01:9:18,870 --> 01:9:20,480 01:9:18,880 --> 01:9:22,159 to judge i mean certainly people have 01:9:20,470 --> 01:9:22,159 01:9:20,480 --> 01:9:24,000 made this argument that we're not 01:9:22,149 --> 01:9:24,000 01:9:22,159 --> 01:9:26,400 getting as much information as or 01:9:23,990 --> 01:9:26,400 01:9:24,000 --> 01:9:27,839 as much innovation as we thought uh 01:9:26,390 --> 01:9:27,839 01:9:26,400 --> 01:9:29,440 we're still getting more information 01:9:27,829 --> 01:9:29,440 01:9:27,839 --> 01:9:31,040 more innovation at least in terms of 01:9:29,430 --> 01:9:31,040 01:9:29,440 --> 01:9:34,080 patents and things like that 01:9:31,030 --> 01:9:34,080 01:9:31,040 --> 01:9:36,080 than we did earlier in the century so 01:9:34,070 --> 01:9:36,080 01:9:34,080 --> 01:9:37,759 we're better there it's just that the 01:9:36,070 --> 01:9:37,759 01:9:36,080 --> 01:9:39,520 innovations we're creating aren't having 01:9:37,749 --> 01:9:39,520 01:9:37,759 --> 01:9:42,239 as much impact on our lives 01:9:39,510 --> 01:9:42,239 01:9:39,520 --> 01:9:44,319 in terms of things like life expectancy 01:9:42,229 --> 01:9:44,319 01:9:42,239 --> 01:9:45,920 or reducing infant mortality 01:9:44,309 --> 01:9:45,920 01:9:44,319 --> 01:9:47,359 or economic growth at least as 01:9:45,910 --> 01:9:47,359 01:9:45,920 --> 01:9:50,000 economists measure it 01:9:47,349 --> 01:9:50,000 01:9:47,359 --> 01:9:51,679 so that's the tricky part and i guess we 01:9:49,990 --> 01:9:51,679 01:9:50,000 --> 01:9:54,560 also need to know how to be able to 01:9:51,669 --> 01:9:54,560 01:9:51,679 --> 01:9:55,440 make use of all this information so we 01:9:54,550 --> 01:9:55,440 01:9:54,560 --> 01:9:57,760 need 01:9:55,430 --> 01:9:57,760 01:9:55,440 --> 01:9:58,719 to improve as information consumers and 01:9:57,750 --> 01:9:58,719 01:9:57,760 --> 01:10:0,840 01:9:58,709 --> 01:10:0,840 01:9:58,719 --> 01:10:2,719 recombine to find the recombinations i guess what have you seen in terms of the political brain the way that you get this sort of orwellian double speak at times the way that you sort of deceive truth and you don't say exactly what you mean have you looked into the evolutionary origins of that are humans the only animal that does something like that well i mean i haven't focused on that very much myself i although i am interested in the effects of things like prestige on how much people pay attention to others and i'm also interested in ethnic cues so things like dialect dress and other kinds of cultural cues can cause people to orient towards some individuals instead of others and be more likely to believe that there's also ways in which we tag information so if someone says something that we believe is true and someone else says something we believe is false we're more likely to believe the next thing that we don't know about when it comes from the person who first said something that we believe in uh and that can lead to all kinds of this political siloing that we see so you share some basic beliefs with the politician but not with another politician then the next thing they say one guy says there's no climate change one guy says there is climate change you might believe the guy who says there's no climate change because you believe the first set of things he says or some other representation of his value system uh so there's some uh tools within culture cultural evolution to think about those kinds of things but i haven't focused on that myself what are some of those tools well kind of these biases and learning so people uh have people they think are prestigious they tend to look to them they look for people who are making costly displays so people who pay costs like martyrs is the classic example who believe some who say something and then they demonstrate that they believe it by paying some kind of cost so religions have harnessed this by priests and other religious leaders taking vows of celibacy or taking vows of poverty this actually makes them a better transmitter of information because you're more likely to believe the stuff they say because of the action they've taken the effects of these uh ethnicity cues so for example if your politician speaks your language in the same dialect you speak it and the other politician speaks a different dialect of your language even though they're both perfectly understandable you're more inclined to learn from and want to interact with the one who speaks your same dialect and we can see this in a one-year-old and we can see this in four-year-olds so there's some interesting developmental research done yeah i think that there's a line in secret of your success about how much better it's like the effect isn't huge it's like 10 to 15 percent on how people learn better from people who look and talk like them yeah yeah and uh there's i mean we also see this with with cues like sex so uh males tend to listen to other males a little bit more than they tend to listen to uh females and same thing with females uh we have ethnic hues language uh sex cues so these are self-similarity cues and then there's things like success and prestige and all of these things kind of cumulatively direct our attention to some people and not others and so this affects cultural evolution but it probably also affects the development of political ideologies groups and things like that what is something in the field of just the area of your studies that you feel like hasn't been transmitted into the general consensus but you see as extremely important for human society to understand well that's hard to say i mean i think that one of the big things that i'm interested in is uh and that i think is not appreciated widely at this point is the degree to which our institutions languages and technologies shape how we think so there's still very much a standard model within psychology that basically we get our minds from our genes and they study the fundamental operations of those the anthropologists are in charge of talking about the content the sociologists and that there's not it doesn't change our patterns of thinking by growing up in a world with that speaks a particular language or uses a certain technology or has certain ways of organizing life like polygeny like monogamy um or all kinds of other institutions being having a democracy not having a democracy so higher level institutions and that really changes uh everything uh in the sense that at least in the sense of how you do policy or how you do social science or those yeah you speak multiple languages right yeah and how of how do you feel like you're different in each of those languages well i don't think that i speak spanish or fijian or any of those languages well enough to experience that but one of the fun things i have seen is i have friends who are fluent in multiple languages and when i speak to them in spanish uh they have a different personality they're one thing in one guy in particular uh than when he speaks english so it's almost like he has his spanish-speaking personality which is livelier makes different jokes i guess uh than his english speaking personality yeah it's funny how reggaeton music is hispanic and sort of matches the latin tongue in terms of the fluidity of it and the way that it moves your body so vividly yeah yeah yeah so i think and you know and so in part of that language that differences in speaking probably just reflects that when my friend is speaking spanish he's thinking about the social world or it's you know unconsciously cueing up the social world that he has to navigate and the kinds of relationships he has and all those kinds of things where when he speaks english he's thinking about you know he's learned english in the us uh he's thinking about navigating the world amongst americans and whatnot so it just takes different it's drawing different things out of him what have you seen in terms of learning disabilities i think that this is one of the debates that i wish was discussed more you know we see learning disabilities as such a bad thing and just look at the drugging of american boys who are young and the way that school really isn't designed for them but i was looking at this painter he's more of a like a sketching draw drawer and what he can do is he can fly over a city in a helicopter and he can look at the city and 20 minutes later he can land on the ground and recreate the entire city on paper without looking at an image and i'm talking down to the little details of window coverings but he has this autistic mind and he's not really able to compress information in the same way so it's like the lack of compression in one place hurts his ability to be social in another and my goodness i feel like we see these ideas as such a curse but they could be such a gift in terms of the creativity and the innovation that they bring yeah so i i share your feelings or your intuitions on that is that you know there's lots of interesting cognitive diversity and you know the education system is improving on this front but it's still the case that we there's a bit of a one-size-fits-all there are certain hurdles one has to go through and that if we could be a little bit more flexible to have a bit more personalized tracks for for these different kinds of minds we could get a lot more out of the cognitive diversity and i mean you know thinking different is an opportunity for creativity or for thinking thoughts that no one has thought before or putting together ideas in ways that people haven't put them together before and i think you know trying to figuring out new ways to harness those that natural variation is going to be is important do you think that there's any societies that do this well well uh i mean there's a the problem is it's we kind of need a formal education system because we have to make sure people are literate and have a certain basic set of skills to make their way in the world so in that sense as soon as you start having formal education is when we can cut those people off because other societies if you don't have a formal education system people are just using they're doing whatever they can do well within their cultural milieu so we got to somehow figure out how to preserve the kind of freedom of of navigating the world with the cognitive abilities you have but also making sure people are educated and literate and those kinds of things have certain shared areas of knowledge and skills so well so there's a you know it's a bit of two you have kids how do you think that they learn differently with the internet maybe with youtube versus the sort of one size fits all standard model that i think that you're referring to here yeah uh i mean you know there's lots of interesting new ways of learning like you mentioned youtube is one of them uh and even learning physical skills from that uh my daughter did martial arts for a while which seemed very valuable to her um but i think we're still figuring out how to harness all these new technologies and how to make the best use of them and how to integrate them into what we think of is delivering the formal education and getting children to the to have this shared basis of cognitive abilities that we need but at the same time not strangling off these unusually creative minds or minds that are that have just worked differently than than the average yeah i feel like there's a really interesting sort of thread that we're literally pulling on here basically saying let's actually be more explicitly aware of the wisdom that the collective brain brings and let's acknowledge that but at the same time say hey there's a bunch of individuals who have these very one-of-a-kind brains and we can harness those too so we can actually get more individuality and originality but more collectivism and that those two ideas fuse together can create more progress and development and innovation for the human species yeah so that and that's a key point i think you made is that the collective brain part of what makes it work is the variation right so the collective brain works on there's a bunch of different ideas out there and they're recombining and so and they're getting sorted through time as people select some over the others but you need cognitive diversity to generate all these different kinds of ideas which then can be picked up and and passed on yeah have you looked into because we're talking about ideas and how ideas spread and brian eno has this really interesting idea where he says gossip is philosophy in that what gossip is is it's people coming together to philosophize on what a society should have and what it shouldn't have and there's a collective brain within gossip oh we don't like that that person did that what do you see as the role as of gossip do you agree with his assessment there yeah i mean yeah i uh it's just an interesting it's just kind of a funny way of uh creative way of approaching it so i think that gossip is about norms and norm violations and you're and so for example in fiji if somebody does something that others don't like they don't immediately respond or i mean if it's a kid they do but if it's an adult they don't but what they do is they start talking to others about it and the person can end up getting scolded for their behavior but first there has to be a kind of meeting of the minds and an agreement basically through gossip that this is a bad thing and that this person has to be brought into line so it's kind of a way of coming to an agreement that yes this is a norm violation and we need to we need to take some action but it's only through the through the shared agreement that this is that people are then say okay because otherwise if you were to act as an individual then that could create bad relationships with the person that you're scolding or trying to bring back into line and their people are very concerned about harmony uh so you would only do that after you kind of you know did the social network and the gossip thing to make sure that yes we all agree this is bad yeah it's fascinating how much a lot of these social interactions of like we all agree it's bad to harm and sort of like what you were just saying how deeply embedded that is into the structure of the mind yeah so i really think we're involved norm learners so we you know grow up in these worlds and we acquire certain ways of behaving and that if somebody violates that it really bothers us and you know we're kind of motivated to take action but of course you know we don't want to take action unilaterally sometimes uh which is what's what happens in the communities i've lived in so there's a lot of variation in people's willingness to take action so and to engage in this third-party punishment that economists talk about yeah you talk about how we're evolved norm learners you know we're talking about education this is actually one thing that's really exciting about youtube if you take your work seriously that humans are very imitative doesn't youtube open up a kind of imitative learning that expands the number of people who can effectively become an apprentice of somebody yeah yeah i know so it's huge so you can learn from just these you know global experts on topics uh through this new media something we haven't had before so assuming that something can be learned through this median then it's then it's an amazing opportunity presumably the technology will make that easier and easier eventually we'll have virtual virtual youtube uh and you can kind of be present in a three-dimensional world with the person but yeah we'll see how that goes that's a huge possibility everybody can learn from the world's expert yeah exactly and i think everyone can copy the world's expert i think that it is that word copy of watch and do what they do that i think is particularly valuable it's not just that you're hearing what they say you're reading what they've written like i think school does a decent job of doing that but it is just watching them with their actions right yeah and that's important because uh there's lots of research to suggest that people if people hear you say words and they see you as a valuable model then that prevents it that convinces them to say those words but if the words imply some costly action then they're not very persuaded unless they also see you do the costly action so if it's something like giving to charity they've done lots of experiments with children which i just i describe in the and if the if the model said it's important to give to charity and then gives only a little bit to charity the children will copy and then say something like yeah it's good to give to charity and then also give a little bit to charity so they they copy the what they say but then they also copy what they do and those don't have to go together yeah you know you you know where you really see that a lot i know so many people whose parents took them to church all and they said you got to go to church you got to go to church but the parents themselves weren't that religious and i don't know what's going on there i find it very interesting this idea that people might even feel like they should be more religious than they actually are yeah but uh in the religion case there's a there's a growing body of research now showing that these things i've been describing these credibility enhancing displays are crucial for passing religious commitment on so if you were in a family even a community where people engaged in costly acts to go to church they went to church it was long it was boring they gave to charity there were events or something like that that were costly then that leads to the children being more likely to hold believe in god and all those kinds of things where if you went to a place where it was easy it was conv you know people went when they were convenient but you didn't see a lot of these costly acts you might have heard the same words but you didn't internalize and and the faith didn't become deep what if you had something like google trends for the last 10 000 years and you could map sort of psychological flows and you could take the word apocalypse or something and as apocalypse goes up people having kids goes down i can't believe how many people who are close to me now are so scared about the future when it comes to climate change when it comes to all the debt that the western world is in don't want to have kids because of that and there's this often these apocalyptic undertones that are contributing at least in my own social circles to these evolutionarily maladaptive trends that i think you were discussing a couple minutes ago yeah i mean so and i feel like with big data these days that would be that would be testable um you'd have to figure you could look at fertility rates and then people's beliefs about the future or the coming apocalypse or something like that to see if you're seeing drops in those segments of the population drops infertility in those segments of the population where these beliefs are popular do a lot of cultures have an idea of an apocalypse or dystopia and utopia yeah i mean it's pretty often that people have a belief that there's some big calamity coming um famously in new guinea there was these cargo cults where people were doing a ritual that they thought would bring about the end of the world and those seem to pop up you know periodically in different parts of the and how did those cargo cults function well i mean it's it's a belief that uh uh we can bring on a different world or or a catastrophe is coming and then we have to do these rituals which are going to help us get out of the catastrophe uh like there was this hellbob comet that went by at one point and the bunch of people killed themselves is as part of a set of beliefs that they thought they were you know escaping a catastrophe you know you talk about these beliefs and stuff why has it gotten so rare it seems for people to believe in gods like what the greeks had or what the egyptians had whether they were all these different kinds of gods the god of sun the god of rain and stuff why have we culturally moved into the one big god idea that i know a lot of people are like no that is true why is it so hard to convince people now that there could be many gods yeah uh well the big thing is the success of these big god religions and part of the case that my collaborators and i have made is those religions have had a competitive advantage against these other religions possibly in part because i mean i talked about the cooperation stuff earlier but they may also had an advantage because they were intolerant of other gods so in this sense if you win you get to exterminate the other gods from people's belief systems and that's that can be an advantage if you let the other gods kind of hang around then they might out-compete you someday so so that may play a role although we haven't done much research on that feature of the id of the of the work yeah there's this big growth component that like i grew up jewish and judaism actually has a culture of rejecting new converts three times before they want to come in whereas christianity has a prophetizing culture like i know a lot of christians who want me to become christian and it seems like that is evolutionarily very intelligent as a strategy for these religions yeah so you can think of uh modern religious as having two strategies so one is the kind of primordial strategy that judaism uses where they're not into converts but there is this deep sense of uh ethnic interconnectedness that you know we can see ourselves uh on the passover seder as connected to these slaves in egypt and we you know there's a set of tribes and we're all descendants of that tribe so that gives us a that gives a kind of you know you feel bound to that group and then the christians have this other strategy which is we can bring anyone into our group that allows our group to grow faster but then maybe the expenses you don't have as much of that ethnic binding uh feeling that you get with the sense that we're all descended from this as part of this descent group yeah when you grow up jewish you know what you hear all the time we are the chosen people and you look to your left and you look to your right you that's us you're an ally when it comes to um hold on uh let me just get my figure out where i want to go next i was in um australia one time and we were at the museum of south wales and it was in sydney and there was a guy who was looking really closely at one of these these statues basically was a aboriginal statue and he was looking at the drawings and on those drawings he could see that there were certain meanings about his and that ideas were passed down from generation to generation through the drawings and i didn't even know that that was possible let alone watching somebody discover things about his family next to me how does that work and is that common um i uh i don't know much about that um there are all kinds of interesting ways that people have figured out to to communicate ideas through cave paintings or other kinds of rock art uh and this has this has certainly evolved you see it in the southwest of the united states you see it uh in our you know you see it in australia you see it in south africa um so yeah it seems it seems to pop up relatively frequently amongst amongst small-scale societies what do you see in the southwest the united states particularly well i don't know too much about that but i do know that there's a tradition of rock art that was common among the aboriginal peoples but that's that's the extent of my knowledge hmm so coming into weird people how if you could or maybe you don't want to but if you could re-do the way academic research is operated i mean it seems to be an issue that what 16 of the world is weird and we have the vast majority of our data on those people yeah i mean so the first problem with the the way the social sciences are structured is that there's the there shouldn't be discipline social science disciplines the way there are so for example if you want to study economics you could study that in the discipline of economics you could also do economic sociology economic anthropology or you could study economic decision making in psychology and in many ways you'd be studying the exact same topic but it's just spread across these different disciplines so those are just historical products there's no reason there's no natural category economics no natural category psychology i mean economic decision making within economics is rooted in our psychology uh so none of those make sense so you'd have to redo those and then the way we should be collecting data is you know we should have labs uh living you know in communities uh looking at how people live their lives and then also gathering the kind of data that psychologists are interested in so experimental data there should also be health data there could be kind of neuroscience data i mean you can't have an fmri machine in every community but you could have some other kinds of tools that allow you to get data on brains and this would give us kind of a worldwide picture of how people come to have the kind of ways of thinking that they do the motivations that they do how that's acquired as kids grow up how child development is different in different places we now know that many of the developmental sequences that have been described by psychologists are just peculiar to western societies and that you see quite different sequences in other places but there's so little work that we can't it's hard to characterize that beyond knowing that the western sequences is peculiar and what is the main constraint on us being able to do that is it technology is it that certain societies just don't want to do this what's going on there um well you mean why we haven't done this or yeah basically well i think well so uh i don't think it has to do with other societies i think it has to do with the sense in psychology and other social science disciplines except for anthropology that uh we could just study american or european kids mostly american and that that would give us the picture of humans that we need so there was an implicit assumption that findings from american kids would generalize to humans uh and you know and if you look at a social science textbook you'll see it'll people have this bias or that bias or they think in this way but the people it turns out if you look behind the studies there are 96 percent of them are western uh and not 70 of those are american so in no way can you generalize and the data is now becoming available to show how that you can't generalize so i don't know maybe it was a good assumption at the time maybe it was a bad assumption i mean the problem with anthropology was they kind of understood this from lots of field ethnography but they weren't willing to adopt all the other tools that this other social sciences were using statistics and experiments and all that kind of stuff that you need to do it right what's an example of something that we think to be true in america that doesn't generalize to the rest of well um there's there's so many so uh i mean we were talking about individualism before so how people think about themselves uh whether they think about themselves as mostly a cluster of attributes and achievements or whether they think of themselves as a node in a network and does their meaning come from that network that they're in or does it come from these attributes and aspirations that they've cultivated another simple one is you'll often hear that people are overconfident uh well it turns out that that actually varies quite a bit and some people are properly calibrated in other societies and being overconfident seems to be a western thing and it may give you an advantage in navigating uh a world an individualistic world because unless you're overconfident there's lots of chances you might not take uh but if you're overconfident you think you're you're more likely to succeed so you take the chance and then you at least have a chance to succeed whereas if you've never tried you wouldn't have a chance to succeed but if you're in a world of relationships you know there's a different calculus going on how does overconfidence vary among men and women i'm going to give a hypothesis that men at least at the tails are have the potential to be way more overconfident because i think men feel the need to take risks to to prove themselves and find a mate uh that is certainly true amongst uh western males and uh but we did find domains in japan uh in some domains males are more overconfident than females but we found a domain where there was no difference so there is some cultural variability and it depends on the domain so you can test people on their math confidence you can test them on their empathetic skills uh you know you can make them predict other kinds of things about their performance and that's kind of how we measure it and there seems to be variation across i mean as a broad brush stroke males are more overconfident than females you know we're talking here about overconfidence but do you see differences between cultures in terms of their the glue of imitation so to speak like are all humans sort of equally imitative or are different cultures like imitative but very different ways yeah so uh certainly the case that uh humans are you know we're a cultural species we're highly imitated from a young age all this cultural learning is requisite for learning language and everything we have to do to make our way in the world but with that as a kind of human universal background then you get to adults who have been socialized and we see differences in uh the degree to which people will rely on uh social learning versus individual learning so there's a psychologist named alex masoudi who compared social learning in chinese and uh british subjects i believe and he found that the chinese subjects were more inclined to rely on social learning in solving a problem whereas the british subjects were slightly more inclined to kind of try to go their own way and just kind of figure it out for themselves so yeah you know we talk about imitative learning how does all of this influence your perception on the school system you know we have such a explicit idea of what learning is teacher communicates idea to student student retains that but it seems like if i were to take the logical conclusions of what you're saying here learning should be wildly different with much more of an apprenticeship model and much more of a get out start making mistakes start hunting and figure things out yeah i mean if if you were to take the kind of cult social learning literature that's available in anthropology across societies it really does look like for learning lots of kinds of things humans are well adapted to an apprenticeship model now there might be some things which you need you need a certain amount of top-down lecturing but you should probably do some lecturing and then move into a more collaborative apprenticeship type model as soon as possible and i think lots of people who study education uh have recognized that but it's hard to get that implemented at a mass scale given you know that what we've already done with with mass you know you know uh universal education you think youtube changes that it may it may it may give people lots of opportunities to the degree to which people can use their apprentice style as apprenticeship child learning over youtube uh it certainly seems like you can for some things so yeah that may change things yeah so there's a basketball player named jason tatum plays for the boston celtics and when he was 21 there was an article in the wall street journal about him and basically coaches were judging his game and they were like he's 21 years old and he has the footwork of somebody who's been in the league studying basketball for decades it turns out he has been studying basketball for decades because he would go on slow motion and watch the footwork of different nba players and so what you're seeing is and it's the same thing in golf the technique has just improved and improved and improved where your median person has basically become much more skilled in terms of what they can do but i'll tell you what my concern is my concern is that what this does even though it creates a cultural evolution that probably speeds up the rate of competence my worry is that you lose some of the elements of randomness that then create these sort of step function innovations right right because everybody is keying in on a few of the greats and uh that reduces the amount of noise or random variation in the system yeah i like that example yeah i mean that's actually one of my big concerns about sort of like one of these fundamental tensions that i think about when i grapple with your work is it's yes the internet and the the way that the world is coming together sort of increase can increase the rate of progress and the diffusion of knowledge in the short term but my concern is that they're sort of these cognitive leaps and we're getting really good at taking steps but do steps actually are they actually inversely correlated with leaps yeah so i mean there is some interesting theoretical and experimental work done by max deray and rob boyd and what they do is they give subjects an experimental problem where there's several different ways to solve the problem and you can kind of incrementally go up one solution until you get to the best solution or if you go a different direction you can go up and maybe you get higher so you get to a better solution and what they show is the best system is partially interconnected so you need different groups that can learn from each other but are somewhat independent and they allow you to explore the space better if everybody is really well connected then if you end up on one of the the less good solutions you go up to the top of the solution and then everybody is as good as they can get and there's no way to get to the higher solution it's even better um so yeah so so this is a real problem and the key is not to get uh too interconnected i guess you need lots of subgroups trying to solve the problem in different ways have you seen any groups that don't have any contact with the outside world and might live like here's an example so maybe sherpas sherpas might be biologically evolved to be able to deal with high climates in a way that people outside of there aren't and so do you see places where to a normal it seems like there's these super human abilities but it's just because they've evolved in a different area i mean the classic case that you learn in high school biology is like sickle cell anemia yeah there's stuff like that all over uh so you pointed out this high altitude case one of my favorite cases is in indonesia or no no the philippines uh uh c nomads so c nomads do underwater foraging so every day they gotta go get their dinner from the bottom of the shallow sea and uh melissa elardo has shown that they have different genes that give them a larger spleen which allows them to hold their breath for so they'll swim down to the bottom and stay down there for a really long time i don't know if my fijian friends have that as well but i've gone diving with them and i can hold my breath longer than the average person around here and i'd go down with them we'd swim around for a while i'd get completely exhausted i have to go back up the top come down have to go back up again come down and you know they're still down there it's really really incredible wow that's cool did you get better at it as you were living there yeah i mean uh i i did get better at it and i was particularly impressed because as an adolescent i would i used to win underwater swimming contests so uh you know wow that's awesome what have you seen with inspiration like in america it seems like there's a lot of inspiration geared towards innovators for example like there's a big cultural magnet and spotlight shined on entrepreneurs elon musk mark zuckerberg how does the role of inspiration play in some of the cultures that you visited well i mean uh as best we can tell uh there you know there seems to be prestige seems to play a big role and you know people definitely learn from more prestigious members there's a question of who gets prestige so in many of the societies that anthropologists study it tends to be older individuals that will often get prestige whereas i think in the us for example you often get younger people getting a lot of prestige certainly more so than i've seen elsewhere i mean the best fishermen in fiji for our younger guys but that's their certain kind of physical requirements that prevent the older guys who can't fish anymore are still widely respected because they have a lot of phishing knowledge and other kinds of knowledge um yeah so so that seems to be universal and it does inspire people i mean i'm one of the things i've been studying is uh patenting and having a parent that got a patent or uh living in a place where people got patents in a certain domain really does inspire younger people if there was a woman in your county who got a patent then if you're a woman you're more likely to get a patent so you see clear role models playing a role there yeah i think i've seen some similar outcomes from raj chetty on some ideas that's yeah i was thinking of the chatty paper yep culture's a big word and it's hard to study because it at least seems so amorphous and sort of fuzzy within culture what are the parameters that are the most interesting to focus on well it depends what you're interested in because i mean as a cultural species as a social learning species we learn so much of our behavioral phenotype so much of our psychology so if you could be interested in trust or cooperation you could be interested in tool making you could be interested in language you could be interested in the heuristics farmers use to plant their crops those are all culture in the sense that they're all acquired from other people and they pass down through generations they change in various ways it might accumulate so something gets better or more complex so you can apply these ideas to learning to anything culture applies to anything that people learn from other people and that might sound super general except for most species you don't really have to worry about that much because other animals don't do that much social learning yeah there's something that kind of bothers me about your work but i think that it bothers me in part because i think that you're right but i think that you know joe there's something awesome about just i did it it was me you know and um looking at your work i think that we as a society at least in the west we underestimate the impact of culture and you know i just look at myself and like i'm so influenced by the people around me and having accepted that partially from reading your work like i've gotten so deliberate about okay i wanted to move to new york so that i could be in i call new york like an ambition tailwind and then like when i'm in san francisco like i become way more intellectually curious and then it's weird it'll take like three days in a suburb and my intellectual curiosity will go way down so then what i do is i spend time on twitter because then i sort of fake this like oh my god oh my god everybody around me is ambitious and i'm working on stuff and like it's interesting i almost just feel like what the very actionable takeaway from your work is is surround yourself with intelligence not even surround yourself with the kind of people who you want to be more like and once again there's something very trite about that but i think that a lot of the empirical data of your work shows that that's actually true yeah i think that's right i mean we haven't completely nailed this one but there's a number of pieces to say that if you take the same person and you put them in a they say just take u.s cities so forget about cross-cultural differences so diff or at least cross national differences you put them in a different city if it's a larger city they're more likely to er get a patent so they're more likely to invent something um and you know that's clearly shown in the data larger cities produce disproportionately more patents now you might say the more creative people move to those cities you can kind of control for that and the effect still holds but what you can then do is experiments and you randomly put people into different groups some of the groups are more interconnected some aren't the more interconnected groups will produce better products at the end of kind of laboratory generations so you can reproduce the situation in the laboratory so all that kind of points to what you're saying is that there's a lot to be said for the group and the interaction and the size of the group and the flow of ideas among minds that makes individuals more creative independent of what they bring to the table you were an undergraduate major in aerospace engineering and how does that come into your work that's just so cool and out of left field yeah so that was a huge advantage because i i did i have two undergraduate degrees one in aerospace engineering and one in and when i was coming to the end of my undergraduate years i couldn't decide what i wanted to do so i had at one point i had two stacks of applications this is before the internet uh on my desk one was to apply to study space propulsion and one was to apply to study anthropology it didn't make sense to send all these applications out so i ended up just getting a job as an engineer in washington dc so i did that for two years before i went to graduate school at ucla in but as i get into anthropology i encountered this nescent field of cultural evolution where people use mathematical models to think about culture uh and if i had had the engineering degree i couldn't have digested that stuff so easily uh with you know the there's a similarity of the mathematics where there's equilibrium processes and you know it was very easy to apply ideas from aerospace engineering to kind of get a grip on the mathematics that i was seeing in this other field and so that that allowed me an entree to this other way of thinking that i wouldn't have had otherwise did you just grow up loving airplanes i did i did i thought about being an astronaut i liked spaceships that's why i was going to do space propulsion really nice so i grew up loving airplanes for me was the commercial jets i never had the the longing to go to space but i just i've always every time now i go to an airport when i am waiting for my flight i go to the window and i just sit and i just watch airplanes take off i've seen thousands and thousands of them i used to drag my dad down to san francisco airport every single saturday morning and i would just sit there like i was watching the best movie i've ever seen watching airplanes land wow yeah yeah i know i loved airplanes but i was also i was really into the spaceship so in undergrad i took things like orbital mechanics and space propulsion what is it the bigness of it uh yeah i just it just seemed like the new front the new frontier uh yeah you know you're talking about math and models what are some of the downsides of the shift towards you know you read an economics paper now and every abstract begins in this paper we construct a model for x what are we what isn't happening because we're so focused on models well i think different fields have different ways of dealing with models and i interact with a lot of young economists and in that field people will often have a cool empirical result and then they end up scratching their heads because they know they can't publish it unless they have some kind of model that predicts whatever their empirical findings are so then i see these young guys trying to you know concoct some model that's going to produce the interesting empirical finding that they have produced um so that's a case where i think the field just has to be more forgiving of well sometimes just empirical results are interesting and we don't need to have a model justifying our empirical results so kind of the interdisciplinary field that i operate in models are not required they're kind of a mental prosthesis that we use to think more clearly about certain processes but if you just have a kind of star trek like let's see what's out there and some interesting empirical results that show variation that people haven't seen that's that's perfectly fine too and you can publish that as well so i think the main thing is just not to be constrained in your thinking by the models they should ex improve your thinking or expand your thinking they shouldn't contract it yeah you know it's funny we're talking about the cross-pollination of different cultures and ideas and it's just it seems like academia does a pretty poor job of that like i was auditing a class at columbia and i had a friend in the business school all the way on the north side of campus and then i take my class in the philosophy building which is all the way on the east side of campus and i'd go to the pulitzer library which was all the way on the west side of campus in the journalism school and it felt like there was such a lack of cross-pollination in interdisciplinary ways and how have you been able to kind of break through that you're one of the few really interdisciplinary academics that i know well i mean i'm not sure but uh from europe from early in graduate school i was interested in kind of answering these big questions like why humans cooperate or what makes us human or how we can explain how humans went from hunter-gatherer societies to complex nation states and i quickly lost my interest in you know being an anthropologist um and what i see some young scholars doing is like the big questions aren't always driving them sometimes they just want to be a psychologist and if you want to be a psychologist what you do is you look at what psychologists are doing and then you do right but that just leads you to replicate existing work if you have a big question and you don't care about what your identity is then you can freely take from other disciplines without and because you're trying to answer the question so what i always advise people to do is you know get the big question go after it use all the tools available um and spend less time this you know trying to be a member of your tribe uh now that could backfire because of course you have to get a job and so some tribe has to decide to pay you so i i try not to push too hard on that advice yeah you know you once asked one of the most interesting questions i've heard that that that i just want to re-ask it and sort of follow follow down this rabbit hole and it's what why do we love our parents and sisters but we're repulsed by the idea of having sex with them what does that say about the nature of what it means to be attracted to somebody and where does the word attraction actually fall short in terms the way that there's actually splinterings within that word yeah i mean attraction is tricky from this point of view right because it it can mean all kinds of things i mean planets can attract each other and it can mean that you're attracted to somebody emotionally or sexually or these kind of different meanings um that that that phrase that you kind of laid out there is easily explained if you're thinking about it from an evolutionary perspective because you're we we help our kin and we love our kin and we take care of our children because of our genetic relatedness so if you think about it from a fitness maximizing point of view if you don't take care of your children and you're the parents nobody else is so they're not going to have a chance so so evolutionists built in us this these powerful emotions about taking care of our children or taking care of our siblings but very simply there's a possibility of inbreeding so um if you if two people who are closely related have sex if they were to produce offspring that offspring is likely to have recessives that meet each other and that can cause all kinds of uh you end up having poor child development and poor health outcomes so that means there's a selection pressure for not wanting to breed with those you're closely genetic genetically related to and that's this interesting pattern which makes great sense from an evolutionary perspective but is puzzling from some some of the ways we look at the so it seems like there is an inverse of dunbar's number here so dunbar's numbers you can only maintain relationships with 150 people but it seems like there's some kind of dunbar's number that you need a culture or society bigger than x number to not have any inbreeding yeah yeah i mean most human societies that we know of are big enough i mean you know the the genetic data is showing in general pretty low in breeding rates there's some isolated populations in in south america and a few other places they get that get up there kind of high but um yeah see so you need you definitely need there's a minimum population that's viable for sure what have you seen with i mean i would guess that at the individual level we're probably we might even be stagnating in terms of intelligence i mean there's all these funny jokes of like if you were to build a chair from scratch you'd have no idea how to do it and it seems like we're progressing much faster at the cultural evolutionary layer than 02:0:3,030 --> 02:0:6,320 02:0:3,040 --> 02:0:9,760 the individual one is that right 02:0:6,310 --> 02:0:9,760 02:0:6,320 --> 02:0:10,320 uh yes well certainly uh are like if you 02:0:9,750 --> 02:0:10,320 02:0:9,760 --> 02:0:12,560 look at 02:0:10,310 --> 02:0:12,560 02:0:10,320 --> 02:0:14,080 iq scores or something like that some 02:0:12,550 --> 02:0:14,080 02:0:12,560 --> 02:0:15,679 measure of cognitive ability 02:0:14,070 --> 02:0:15,679 02:0:14,080 --> 02:0:17,199 there's been a massive increase in the 02:0:15,669 --> 02:0:17,199 02:0:15,679 --> 02:0:19,199 last century 02:0:17,189 --> 02:0:19,199 02:0:17,199 --> 02:0:21,599 and the way to think about iq is that 02:0:19,189 --> 02:0:21,599 02:0:19,199 --> 02:0:23,679 it's the set of cognitive abilities 02:0:21,589 --> 02:0:23,679 02:0:21,599 --> 02:0:25,440 that lead to success in the current set 02:0:23,669 --> 02:0:25,440 02:0:23,679 --> 02:0:28,639 of institutions we have 02:0:25,430 --> 02:0:28,639 02:0:25,440 --> 02:0:30,320 so uh you know there's a number of 02:0:28,629 --> 02:0:30,320 02:0:28,639 --> 02:0:31,760 different ways to measure iq but all of 02:0:30,310 --> 02:0:31,760 02:0:30,320 --> 02:0:35,840 them are associated with 02:0:31,750 --> 02:0:35,840 02:0:31,760 --> 02:0:38,639 doing well in school earning more money 02:0:35,830 --> 02:0:38,639 02:0:35,840 --> 02:0:40,000 having greater income later in life and 02:0:38,629 --> 02:0:40,000 02:0:38,639 --> 02:0:42,639 but yet that average score 02:0:39,990 --> 02:0:42,639 02:0:40,000 --> 02:0:45,040 has gone up uh by 30 points so if you 02:0:42,629 --> 02:0:45,040 02:0:42,639 --> 02:0:46,880 were to rescore people from 1900 02:0:45,030 --> 02:0:46,880 02:0:45,040 --> 02:0:48,080 by modern standards they would have iqs 02:0:46,870 --> 02:0:48,080 02:0:46,880 --> 02:0:51,520 of 70. the average 02:0:48,070 --> 02:0:51,520 02:0:48,080 --> 02:0:52,560 iq would be 70. and a lot of people have 02:0:51,510 --> 02:0:52,560 02:0:51,520 --> 02:0:54,639 speculated on this 02:0:52,550 --> 02:0:54,639 02:0:52,560 --> 02:0:55,760 i've discussed it in some papers i mean 02:0:54,629 --> 02:0:55,760 02:0:54,639 --> 02:0:58,800 i think that this is 02:0:55,750 --> 02:0:58,800 02:0:55,760 --> 02:1:0,960 uh about the kinds of incentives in 02:0:58,790 --> 02:1:0,960 02:0:58,800 --> 02:1:1,920 the this environments that children face 02:1:0,950 --> 02:1:1,920 02:1:0,960 --> 02:1:4,080 growing up 02:1:1,910 --> 02:1:4,080 02:1:1,920 --> 02:1:5,840 uh the kinds of games they play the 02:1:4,070 --> 02:1:5,840 02:1:4,080 --> 02:1:6,239 kinds of entertainment they participate 02:1:5,830 --> 02:1:6,239 02:1:5,840 --> 02:1:7,920 02:1:6,229 --> 02:1:7,920 02:1:6,239 --> 02:1:9,440 all of these things is and better 02:1:7,910 --> 02:1:9,440 02:1:7,920 --> 02:1:11,920 schooling better nutrition 02:1:9,430 --> 02:1:11,920 02:1:9,440 --> 02:1:13,280 all of these things has pushed uh iq 02:1:11,910 --> 02:1:13,280 02:1:11,920 --> 02:1:14,800 measures up i think 02:1:13,270 --> 02:1:14,800 02:1:13,280 --> 02:1:16,320 what kind of games and entertainment you 02:1:14,790 --> 02:1:16,320 02:1:14,800 --> 02:1:19,040 think make us smarter 02:1:16,310 --> 02:1:19,040 02:1:16,320 --> 02:1:20,239 so um more complex things so one of the 02:1:19,030 --> 02:1:20,239 02:1:19,040 --> 02:1:23,360 examples i like is 02:1:20,229 --> 02:1:23,360 02:1:20,239 --> 02:1:27,040 tv shows watch tv shows from the 1950s 02:1:23,350 --> 02:1:27,040 02:1:23,360 --> 02:1:29,679 and then watch tv shows from 2010 02:1:27,030 --> 02:1:29,679 02:1:27,040 --> 02:1:30,719 now uh they're super they're so much 02:1:29,669 --> 02:1:30,719 02:1:29,679 --> 02:1:33,599 more complicated 02:1:30,709 --> 02:1:33,599 02:1:30,719 --> 02:1:34,960 the 1950s have like one pot line four 02:1:33,589 --> 02:1:34,960 02:1:33,599 --> 02:1:36,960 characters 02:1:34,950 --> 02:1:36,960 02:1:34,960 --> 02:1:39,040 uh whereas now you got ensemble 02:1:36,950 --> 02:1:39,040 02:1:36,960 --> 02:1:40,400 characters 20 different plots going on 02:1:39,030 --> 02:1:40,400 02:1:39,040 --> 02:1:42,080 you've got to be tracking 02:1:40,390 --> 02:1:42,080 02:1:40,400 --> 02:1:44,400 all these different relationships it's 02:1:42,070 --> 02:1:44,400 02:1:42,080 --> 02:1:46,159 it's just a whole different level of 02:1:44,390 --> 02:1:46,159 02:1:44,400 --> 02:1:47,760 cognitive focus and memory and those 02:1:46,149 --> 02:1:47,760 02:1:46,159 --> 02:1:49,599 02:1:47,750 --> 02:1:49,599 02:1:47,760 --> 02:1:51,199 yeah so i have this idea it's called the 02:1:49,589 --> 02:1:51,199 02:1:49,599 --> 02:1:53,760 paradox of abundance 02:1:51,189 --> 02:1:53,760 02:1:51,199 --> 02:1:54,639 and i think the i'll give the food 02:1:53,750 --> 02:1:54,639 02:1:53,760 --> 02:1:55,840 analogy 02:1:54,629 --> 02:1:55,840 02:1:54,639 --> 02:1:57,280 and then i'll give the information 02:1:55,830 --> 02:1:57,280 02:1:55,840 --> 02:1:58,480 analogy because i think it's the same 02:1:57,270 --> 02:1:58,480 02:1:57,280 --> 02:2:1,040 thing happening 02:1:58,470 --> 02:2:1,040 02:1:58,480 --> 02:2:3,599 and in food you see this weird thing 02:2:1,030 --> 02:2:3,599 02:2:1,040 --> 02:2:5,280 where i think 71.6 percent of americans 02:2:3,589 --> 02:2:5,280 02:2:3,599 --> 02:2:8,400 over 20 are obese 02:2:5,270 --> 02:2:8,400 02:2:5,280 --> 02:2:11,360 but if you walk into a gym 02:2:8,390 --> 02:2:11,360 02:2:8,400 --> 02:2:13,040 in a coastal city you'll see some of the 02:2:11,350 --> 02:2:13,040 02:2:11,360 --> 02:2:14,360 best bodies that you've ever seen in 02:2:13,030 --> 02:2:14,360 02:2:13,040 --> 02:2:16,560 human history just these 02:2:14,350 --> 02:2:16,560 02:2:14,360 --> 02:2:18,320 beautifully sculpted people they look 02:2:16,550 --> 02:2:18,320 02:2:16,560 --> 02:2:21,440 like a statue at the met 02:2:18,310 --> 02:2:21,440 02:2:18,320 --> 02:2:23,280 and so what you have is the average 02:2:21,430 --> 02:2:23,280 02:2:21,440 --> 02:2:24,480 becoming more obese and overweight but 02:2:23,270 --> 02:2:24,480 02:2:23,280 --> 02:2:26,480 then the 02:2:24,470 --> 02:2:26,480 02:2:24,480 --> 02:2:28,239 strongest people becoming in more and 02:2:26,470 --> 02:2:28,239 02:2:26,480 --> 02:2:28,719 more shape and i think that something 02:2:28,229 --> 02:2:28,719 02:2:28,239 --> 02:2:31,599 similar 02:2:28,709 --> 02:2:31,599 02:2:28,719 --> 02:2:32,800 is happening with information like i 02:2:31,589 --> 02:2:32,800 02:2:31,599 --> 02:2:34,639 think there's this view of the 02:2:32,790 --> 02:2:34,639 02:2:32,800 --> 02:2:36,480 information superhighway that oh it's 02:2:34,629 --> 02:2:36,480 02:2:34,639 --> 02:2:37,599 all gonna make us smarter but like 02:2:36,470 --> 02:2:37,599 02:2:36,480 --> 02:2:39,360 you know if you look at political 02:2:37,589 --> 02:2:39,360 02:2:37,599 --> 02:2:40,239 debates they've become more and more 02:2:39,350 --> 02:2:40,239 02:2:39,360 --> 02:2:42,400 superficial 02:2:40,229 --> 02:2:42,400 02:2:40,239 --> 02:2:43,599 as more and more information has 02:2:42,390 --> 02:2:43,599 02:2:42,400 --> 02:2:47,119 happened but then 02:2:43,589 --> 02:2:47,119 02:2:43,599 --> 02:2:48,880 when i talked to investors or older 02:2:47,109 --> 02:2:48,880 02:2:47,119 --> 02:2:50,639 people they'll often say the smartest 02:2:48,870 --> 02:2:50,639 02:2:48,880 --> 02:2:53,119 young people i've met 02:2:50,629 --> 02:2:53,119 02:2:50,639 --> 02:2:56,880 now are way smarter than the smartest 02:2:53,109 --> 02:2:56,880 02:2:53,119 --> 02:2:56,880 young people were when i was growing up 02:2:57,589 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 02:2:57,599 --> 02:3:2,480 okay that's interesting yeah i mean i 02:3:0,550 --> 02:3:2,480 02:3:0,560 --> 02:3:4,960 feel like in general i haven't thought 02:3:2,470 --> 02:3:4,960 02:3:2,480 --> 02:3:6,880 about any specifics but i feel like uh 02:3:4,950 --> 02:3:6,880 02:3:4,960 --> 02:3:8,560 we need to learn how to consume 02:3:6,870 --> 02:3:8,560 02:3:6,880 --> 02:3:9,920 the amount of information that's now at 02:3:8,550 --> 02:3:9,920 02:3:8,560 --> 02:3:12,480 our fingertips 02:3:9,910 --> 02:3:12,480 02:3:9,920 --> 02:3:13,360 uh people aren't very good information 02:3:12,470 --> 02:3:13,360 02:3:12,480 --> 02:3:16,159 consumers 02:3:13,350 --> 02:3:16,159 02:3:13,360 --> 02:3:16,560 yeah well joe heinrich thank you very 02:3:16,149 --> 02:3:16,560 02:3:16,159 --> 02:3:18,960 much 02:3:16,550 --> 02:3:18,960 02:3:16,560 --> 02:3:21,199 and thanks for your work it has given me 02:3:18,950 --> 02:3:21,199 02:3:18,960 --> 02:3:22,800 an appreciation for the collective brain 02:3:21,189 --> 02:3:22,800 02:3:21,199 --> 02:3:24,000 and the environments that i spend time 02:3:22,790 --> 02:3:24,000 02:3:22,800 --> 02:3:27,840 in and given me 02:3:23,990 --> 02:3:27,840 02:3:24,000 --> 02:3:30,320 an empirical backing for those ideas so 02:3:27,830 --> 02:3:30,320 02:3:27,840 --> 02:3:34,000 i'm a big fan and thanks your time all 02:3:30,310 --> 02:3:34,000 02:3:30,320 --> 02:3:34,000 right thanks a lot david
