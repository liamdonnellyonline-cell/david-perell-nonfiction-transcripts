you know it's funny we're talking about the cross-pollination of different cultures and ideas and it's just it seems like academia does a pretty poor job of that like i was auditing a class at columbia and i had a friend in the business school all the way on the north side of campus and then i take my class in the philosophy building which is all the way on the east side of campus and i'd go to the pulitzer library which was all the way on the west side of campus in the journalism school and it felt like there was such a lack of cross-pollination in interdisciplinary ways and how have you been able to kind of break through that you're one of the few really interdisciplinary academics that i know well i mean i'm not sure but uh from er from early in graduate school i was interested in kind of answering these big questions like why humans cooperate or what makes us human or how we can explain how humans went from hunter-gatherer societies to complex nation states and i i quickly lost my interest in you know being an anthropologist um and what i see some young scholars doing is like the big questions aren't always driving them sometimes they just want to be a psychologist and if you want to be a psychologist what you do is you look at what psychologists are doing and then you do that right but that just leads you to replicate existing work if you have a big question and you don't care about what your identity is then you can freely take from other disciplines without and because you're trying to answer the question so what i always advise people to do is you know get the big question go after it use all the tools available um and spend less time this you know trying to be a member of your tribe uh now that could backfire because of course you have to get a job and so some tribe has to decide to pay you so i i try not to push too hard on that advice
