the first one i want to talk about is this idea of exotropic energy i'd never come across that term before it's in contrast to entropy talk about that idea and why it's centered in california so ex-trophy extra p was a term that was invented by a guy named max moore he started a little kind of a movement and it was kind of a transhumanist idea he was of the transhumanist group and the idea was that it was um um supposed to be this kind of positive um transhumanist force of of evolution in the right direction i hijacked and appropriated the term and changed the spelling a little bit to mean in a technical sense the opposite of entropy so everybody knows where entropy is it's kind of the running down the heat depth of the universe everything is kind of running down until it's all flat and everything's the same that's the basic physical idea so entropy this running down this inevitable decay well it will decay as a whole system and there's entropy as a universal principle is although one of the few things we've seen no exceptions for anywhere except there are these local pockets where the order actually increases over time and it does that only interestingly by increasing the entropy around it wow so the cost of making that little extra order is actually by increasing the entropy that increasing order we call life okay so life is a system that kind of increases entropy in one area in order to build up order somewhere else and that's technically called negative entropy but because entropy is already a negative i didn't like double negatives so i said okay it needs a positive term because that building up to means it's a positive so i call it exotropy so exotropy is the positive force in the universe that tends to want to increase a special kind of order in a local area and that is an unbroken chain in terms of what we've seen of our own experience of kind of a self-organizing increasing um exotropy and and i have a theory that that increasing self-organization over time is actually what technology is which is an extension of what life is which is an extension of the same kind of physical systems that have been working to make first of all galaxies which are stable and order out of random particles in the universe and then planets first actually they're making the elements and then planets or stars and then planets and that those same forces of self-organization are actually exotropic okay so they're they're they're they're little bits of little corners that don't run down they actually build up over time and that self-organizing aspect is very evident in the way life self-organizes itself and becomes more complicated and so forth and in my view technology which is an extension of the evolutionary process in life is very exotropic so that's a long-winded way to say that exo trophy is the sort of opposite of entropy and why has it been centered in california california going back to the summer of love even going back to the gold rush has always been a place of of of radical imagination of conquering the frontier and where california used to be this geographic frontier it has now become an intellectual one why has that been the geography where this has taken place because there have been no adult supervision the california was settled by young men restless young men who came out for adventure and interesting of all the places in the world the us was the only place where the government did not claim the goal they actually led it up to individual young brazen young men to claim it and so you had this whole city and area being settled by young men without supervision no one to tell them they can't do something and that spirit kind of shaped uh the culture of the city for a long very bohemian very kind of do what you want kind of libertarian and um that went through the beatniks and through the hippies and so it's always been this little place that was very far from the center the capital is 3 000 miles away the funding is 3 000 miles away the elites and the you know the the adult people the authorities the authors are all 3000 miles away and so you had this kind of um an opportunity where people started things in garages they couldn't get funding from the government or the rich people so they got funding from each other um and they started this kind of vc startup um idea um which was a new gold rush and so the california ideology has always been a kind of do-it-yourself um because no no one to tell you no you know ask forgiveness not for permission and that's been kind of fundamental to the settling of this you know even down in l.a you know walt disney and all they were they were just sort of um not asking for permission far enough away from the centers of authority to um be forced to so this is not a choice people you know it's kind of like startups the the reason why startups succeed is because they don't have money and that not having money forces them to invent things rather than purchase them so a big company if they have a problem their solution is we're going to apply some money to this we're going to buy things we're going to buy our solution that doesn't work the startup doesn't have that they would like to buy the solution but they don't have any resources to so they have to invent the solution and that's sort of what happened in the west there was far enough from the funding centers that they would like to have some money for grants and other stuff but no one was giving it to him so they were forced to invent it themselves and that kind of a culture has persisted all the way through and now you know we have california and it's uh we've become we used to be as a society people in the book now we've become people on screen and big screens small screens hollywood screens phone screens we're now people the screens and going from there talk about that you know i'm a huge fan of march mcluhan he was the first author for me that was like almost like the nuclear bomb of the mind people have this idea of a quake book and i read mcluhan and i said oh my goodness the way that i've been seeing the world until today has been wrong it's been misguided i miss something in front of me that now i see and one of the things that i think you really understood was how society was going from a culture of the printed word to a culture much more of the image similar to what you're saying with with screens and what is your take on what the screens are doing to consciousness and i mean we can just focus on screens now and then i think we can move into networks which you've written about yeah so yeah i'm i'm i'm i'm a fan of mcluhan we made him the patron saint of wired from the very first issue we it was my idea was to declare him the patron saint and if you know any mcluhan the joke is of course he was very catholic yeah uh but um i've taken the clue into heart because i've never read macleod the whole point of mcloone is you don't read them you only hear about them i found him impossible to read he is impossible to read but you got to watch him how he made his books you would understand because he would recline on his couch and look up and dictate he would just recite and they had scribes writing down what he was spouting and that was how he wrote it was a very oral you know he was a professor of rhetoric and so um it was a very oral thing and that just didn't uh you know you have to hear about mcluhan rather than read them so um the movement to screens is is fundamental it's it's very foundational because the thing about books is that they're made up of text and black and white ink that doesn't change so it's very fixed there's a permanence a monumental aspect of the scriptures and the constitution and laws and from those authors we get authority okay and so um we've had this authority-based culture based around texts and books well the screen has none of that it's ephemeral things flit across it's flowing it's liquid it's messy it's open-ended it's never finished and so you can't get truth from the authority you have to assemble your own truth okay so so this is the this is the problem right now is we're having to assemble our truths okay because we can't rely on the authorities of authors and so everything is fluid and dynamic and changing and never finished we have constant endless updates to things wikipedia is never done it's always ongoing it's not really a book it's a screen and so the the failing or the i would say the um the bane of the printed world was propaganda the bane of the screen world is conspiracy propaganda doesn't work conspiracy is what we have to work against and so because you're all assembling your own truth this is a you know it's contextual it's it's up to you it's a big weight um and so we have a different way in which we know things and i'm really interested in how we change how we know something and and a lot of what science has been about the evolution of science is how we know something how we decide if we know something um and so what's interesting about the science i wrote the first piece on the history of the scientific method i mean i was shocked that there wasn't a book or even an article about the history of scientific method because the scientific method is like the foundation of our entire prosperity and there was never had anyone written a history of it because the scientific method itself has evolved and most of what we associate with the scientific method is very very recent like the double-blind experiment wasn't invented until the 50s you know random sampling um you know all these all these components that we think of as as science are very recent which means that the scientific method method is likely to change more in the next 50 years than it has in the past 50 years it'll continue to evolve so i am really interested in how we understand and how we come to what we know and moving to the screen is part of that migration that that shift in what we how we know things and what we think we know and um part of that is is that we are relying less on authorities and texts and more on this fluid liquid streaming flowing streaming world yeah you know it's interesting because in reading mcluhan he had one quote that was something like if you don't dis or if you disagree with what i'm saying so do i and i think that what he was trying to get to was that there were multiple interpretations of what he was saying and often he would throw ideas out there that actually made no sense but were just thought provoking and it's interesting at such a meta level to see how the character of marsh mcluhan anticipated the very things that he was talking and trying to write about in his books yeah absolutely he was a trickster and a jokester i mean he was a very complicated person not at all the kind of stuffy professor he was a prankster a trickster a punster he liked jokes and you know playing with words and and puns and so um i see i think of him as one of those coyote characters you know the coyote trickster and he's caught court jester where he's making a joke about things to make a very profound point so yeah i if you if you disagree with me so do i or something like this it was one of his quotes and so um um yeah that's and that's sort of again you're right that's very reflective of this sort of assembling truth so i you know getting deep into philosophy i would say i believe that at the foundation the very foundation of the universe and the origin of the universe that it rests on paradox that there's an essential paradox because whatever whatever brand you want to get at to the creation of the universe whether you think it self-created or was created by god you still have this self-creations whatever began it had to self-create self-creation is paradoxical right so the origin is paradox rests on some paradox somewhere so i think paradox is at the foundation and so paradox is sort of includes uh you know i think we're heading into a more paradoxical uh place where we can embrace paradox and so once you have recursive self-creation self-organization is paradoxical it's like it's making itself it's it's like the urbers that the it's not the snake swallowing his tail is it's the snake un unleashing its tail as it gets bigger and bigger and so that that that kind of recursive self-organization is paradoxical and so i think whenever we get down to basic things cosmological things they're going to be paradoxes and maybe what we're going into with the screen is a little bit more room to embrace paradox you know i was going to talk about this later but why are there so few religious futurists it seems like you have futurism over here and then you have religion over here and it's the same thing you know and at the end of the book of revelations you know it it talks about a new heaven and a new earth and then we talk about sort of people building this city and going from eden to the city and one of the things i had come across in nisbet's a history of the idea of progress but really came across as i was reading your prediction on the next thousand years of christianity is the idea that christianity in linear really is born out of christian theology and it's interesting because you would hear that you would say well there would be a lot of christian futurists but there aren't and what is the mechanism behind that um well i i i i think there is a whole faction of christian that is very much wedded to the originalist position of the bible and revelation as being the only i mean basically it's the only scenario that's permitted and i i think that's unfortunate because um you should have alternative scenarios um you know in in in a kind of a fuzzy sense but i think you know science fiction is now kind of much more i always say this most of the theology being done today is being done by science fiction where science fiction is grappling with the same kind of issues of what does it mean to be human why are we here where are we going what are we here for um what should we be those used to be the catechism this was usually studying catechism and that and that's no longer relevant for most people i think the general culture has moved away from the established religions as having answers because they're very parochial like you know i just shared the other day a photograph of the 10 million stars at the center of our milky way a photograph you could see 10 million stars of the 400 billion that we have in just our galaxy and it's sort of like okay um so like uh is there only one jesus and we all share them or is like every planet has their own jesus to answer that kind of question you you know what we have right now is not even attempting to answer that and that's the kind of the background of science fiction is saying well this is a really big world we need to think about these issues like what's the role of humans in the world with you know 400 billion other planets with civilizations on them and so um let alone the fact that we're going to make artificial aliens i call them ais you know we're not going to wait for beating e.t we're just going to make various ets on this plant of various kinds of minds we're going to make our own et's our own aliens uh and they're gonna be called robots and ais and they're gonna have the same issues that we would have had if we met creatures from another galaxy it was like what do you believe why are you here so you know i've been working on this project called a catechism for robots it's like okay if we have these things and they do have some kind of sentience or even maybe what do we tell them what what's our message to them what's their role what's their relationship to god where do they fit in the cosmos you know should they believe do they become believers um and so the religions are a little bit bound i think by earth and we have realized that we're just a little tiny rock on the edge of one galaxy and so we have a much broader canvas now to ask these questions and i think science fiction authors intuitively know this and so they're asking the questions that theologians used to ask but in a broader context and they're really wrestling with these issues about if you have other beings who are we what are we good for why are we here and i think the question that's most pertinent to us right now is what do we want to become we are re making and remaking ourselves as humans so what do we want humans to be i mean it's one question it's like what are humans good for now but the real question is what do we want to become and that's a much much harder question i mean most of us particularly when we're young we struggle with our own identity like who do we want to be but now we're applying that at the level of our entire species it's like it's a double whammy so david not only do you have to decide who you want to be you have to decide who we all should be that's a heavy load yeah you know to return to mcluhan here is you know i think that this is one of the big projects of your work is sort of shown in two mcluhan quotes the first is that we drive into the future using our rear view mirror and i think that mcluhan really didn't like he tried to sort of anticipate the future and show us the broad details but there's actually something interested in he hated the future he didn't really want to know right he constantly talked about the fact that he wasn't interested and was a i mean he abhorred in some ways so he so he didn't try to he knew that it would be something he didn't really want so it's something like that and but i think that you're kind of trying to show us to illuminate the path but this is to me what is quite concerning to the extent that we drive into the future using our only rear view mirror that we can only see the future from the past or in the present then do we actually have this ability to shape the world that we're going into or are we gonna end up like a mark zuckerberg who had no idea what he was creating in the early days of build of building facebook he had no idea that he was building this new global village and i think that he sort of stumbled into becoming one of the most powerful people who's ever walked to the planet earth right right so so i have i have this this this thing it took me a long time to kind of realize this but um yeah i mean basically the future is unpredictable the only thing we know about it for sure is that it has to be possible so the impossible futures won't happen so we can kind of use scenario planning and science fiction all kinds of stuff to kind of outline the general sphere or circle of possible what's possible knowing that whatever happens has to happen within that field of the possible and so by going to the outer edges we can kind of stake out some idea of what the boundaries of the possible are so so when we think about the future we may not be right but we can be ready for it we can we can imagine the outer limits and sort of prepare ourselves for the wild edges of it so we don't we're not going to be right but we can be ready we cannot be not surprised so the whole idea of future is that we're not surprised when it comes um that being said the um the thing about new technologies and the way i the reason why i give mark some slack is that it takes several generations for us to decide what they're good for they're kind of like babies uh i i think that technologies have to find the right job and that's our job as their parents to kind of help guide them to find the right role and it takes some time it takes some time and more importantly it takes uses so these things are so complicated these days that we cannot figure out what they're good for by thinking i call that thinkism i think thinkism is a disease of our time it's particularly the disease of really smart guys who like to think and they think that they can solve problems by thinking about them and i think thinkism is completely wrong and that's where the singularity stuff comes well if i can accelerate the thinking about it if i can be really smart we can solve all kinds of problems no you don't just solve problems by thinking about them you actually have to do things you have to try things and so i think that it takes using technology in daily use to figure out how it actually works what's really good about it what's bad about it and then to rectify it to do to this constant iteration where we go back and say oh we don't want to do that there's too much of that let's do it here so through use we figure out what it's good for is through use that we steer it so the problem with a lot of technology critics is they want to ban technologies they want to turn them off turn them away if you do that you don't get to steer you steer technology by using them it's like riding a horse you have to kind of mount it and then get it and then use daily in order to find out what they're good for thinking about them is too complex we just cannot anticipate both its benefits and its harms by thinking we have to only do it by use and the more complicated the technologies get the more critical it is that we arrive there through use okay and so i preach an embrace of technologies as a way to steer them okay so the problem that problem the thing with social media is that it's less than 5 000 days old or something right it's an infant it's going to take some time a generation for us to kind of figure out what it's good for how to use it what the limits are um all these kinds of things and then we can begin to try and steer it i think it's i don't know i think it's weird that we expect that we can kind of know how these very complicated things are going to react it's like deciding your baby's going to be a doctor you know i can see it i can see it in their eyes gonna be an artist they better be an artist they better be whatever it is better be a podcaster you're right and so um so that's where we are so so we're just at the first rev of this we're in the dawn of social media it's gonna take a while and here's the thing that's really really weird about what's been happening in silicon valley and the social media is that the whole the whole genus of like the startup world and vc is that we demoralized failure okay until that moment until that time if you lost a million dollars to someone's investment that was a moral failure that was that was bad you were irresponsible um uh you were not to be punished but you certainly weren't to be given another million dollars um silicon valley came up with this idea that failure was crucial essential to learning and that's been that was the kind of foundational idea in science is that you learned through failures you kept trying if you weren't failing you weren't learning if you were trying something that you knew would work you weren't learning anything new so baked into the idea of the scientific view was this idea that failure mistakes detours all this kind of stuff was part an essential part of the process of progress and that kind of went over into entrepreneur stuff where you would make prototypes that wouldn't work and you'd go through iterations and being agile but but basically it was assuming that you're going to be making a lot of mistakes you had pivots all that kind of stuff so we demoralized failure we made a requirement a part of it and yet when we come to something like social media and these companies we we've been not i i think the moralizing language about the failures of this is not beneficial because we're reintroducing we're saying you're bad people you're you're you're evil you're um this is a moral failure on the part of people no we want to demoralize failures these companies are still young this technology is still young we should be embracing the failures governments are not allowed to fail that's the role of governments that's one of the definitions of the government is that we don't permit them failure that's why they have difficulty being innovative because we don't allow them to fail we them to treat everybody the same so so we don't give them enough room to fail and that's part of what their role is okay it's kind of a trade-off if they're not going to fail they're not going to be very innovative but if we're going to go into the entrepreneur area and the area of business world we want them to have failures and that has to include failures at the level of what's happening with social media we want to be able to correct them we want to have incessant relentless vigilant correction right error correction constantly that's what we're about so if there's any criticism infested was that they weren't correcting fast enough that's a fair criticism but it's still not a moral failure yeah you know we were talking about thinkism which is a great term this idea that we can think the future we can know exactly what it's going to look like in very narrow strokes and then we can anticipate what's going to happen right and you give a great tidbit about the amish and the amish what they do when a new technology is introduced is they ask two questions before they adopt it the first one is will this technology strengthen my family and will this technology strengthen our community and i love this idea that they have these early adopters where certain people will go and they'll adopt a technology for the community and they'll do it for say one year and then the rest of the community will observe what happens to these people do they become more socially isolated do they become more anxious or do they become kinder do they become more generous to the community and then rather than grand architect thinkism they look at what happens they run their own kind of scientific experiment for the community and only then only once the results are in do they make the decision to adopt or to reject that technology yeah that's a very good summary and um it's sort of evidence-based uh technological um policy which is what i advocate for rather than basing our policy on what we could imagine could happen let's base it on what actually does happen let's take the evidence okay so let's take the evidence of social media and use that the actual scholarly scientific evidence rather than all the things that we could imagine could happen and the amish do that in that kind of very ihop way they never actually make a real decision and most of those decisions are at the parish community level one by one but yeah they will allow an amish early adopter to try out always with the caveat that if they observe negative effects he has to surrender that immediately and that's the deal that they make so um and you know bit by bit basically what the amish are is they're very late adopters they're kind of they're in the process right now of accepting cell phones but not smart phones and cell phones for a number of reasons even they don't have phones or wires telephones they were accepting cell phones as appropriate for their life solar recharged all that kind of stuff by people observing the people who were early doctors using which who often began by using them at work first that was often an excuse they use is um and they almost like kind of like the orthodox jew have some really weird work around so they they have this distinction between using something and owning it so they will be often be driven to places they need to go by people who have vans who drive their amish around that's their job they're regular people they're like uber drivers they have vans and they only ferry amish and the amish will ride in the car happily but they don't own the car so um and there you know there is some distinction between owning and access which i talked about as well but this is uh access is a superior then ownership in many ways but the amish do use an evidence-based idea on let's look at how actually how it does and then the criteria that the amish use which you talked about is true and may not be different than individuals but the main difference that the amish have is they have a community criteria they have a collective criteria most people that i've met and i'm sure you included me included will accept we'll use certain technologies and not others we don't have tv in our house someone else may not have um you know a dryer or you know whatever it is but the difference is that i make those as an individual or we have an individual family the thing about the amish which is unusual is they have a collective criteria and so um that's in this individual culture that we have of typical modern americans that's a huge difference and that gives them some power because they're much more they're much more collectivistic than individualistic modern americans have you spent any time doing a study with cultures that don't use technology in a very anthropologist way maybe you're a techno technopologist where like an anthropologist is going to study similarly where there's not civilization in the way that we think about it there's not yeah yeah for you maybe that would be what does it look like in a place with no technology have you spent any time doing that well i spent a lot of time in my young adult years living with people who had very little technology so so i had the privilege of traveling in asia in the early 1970s when there was a magic moment where um someone like me who had no money i could not afford an expedition i could only rant right on the back of a jeep i could arrive at a place that was in the medieval times in the 1500s like northern afghanistan in 1975 say it was a medieval place in every respect that you would measure from the night watchman who had um a lamp he would go down and land the little lanterns in the street lights because there was no electricity in the entire city there was no cars everybody rode donkeys i mean it was they threw garbage out there was no toilets this was a medieval city it was a medieval culture you know child brides the whole thing so um and i lived with people and himalayas and others who basically had almost no metal so they were living and and i know what that was like i i i know viscerally experientially what it was like and there were people who studied those kind of cultures and primitive cultures hunter-gatherer cultures to see what their lives were like and they were it was tough they didn't live long they were always hungry and there were lots of things that they did because of not having surplus um and not having science too to be honest so um there were there are people who have studied that in modern times i did a hunt for the cultures today that would like the amish or where the amish i fully expected that there should be japanese amish because there's israeli amish there you know the orthodox and then there's some um jain in hinduism there are jain culture who reject all kinds of things including shoes and i thought that well there should be a japanese ambush but there weren't any maybe there will be i might make a prediction that they will see japanese amish at some point but there are very few um you know the mennonites and um the um uh hunter rights in canada there's very few who are still maintaining that modern tradition of um decreased and and they're all religious as far as i can tell because it takes that kind of um a commitment i guess i would call it um so um a lot of the anti-civilizationists the you know the kind of luddites the modern luddites they haven't rejected anything they're using computers or they're talking about it but they have not given it up so um so so the only for me the the only real um case or the only real evidence for what a world that technology looks like is the past um and the few hunter-gatherer tribes that we have remaining um you know and and and they are by every account or influenced by modern times is the even the uncontacted ones are really hard to um to evaluate today in terms of what their lives are like but but for my reading this is they're not noble this is not a noble state this is not an elevated desirable state i i i think um a fair reading of it shows that they are really short lives very very tough um always hungry um they make do they can make they can be satisfied and comforted but it's not it's not a place where you you'd want to go you know it's it's really anybody today anyway i have you me any of your listeners could buy it a ticket to the amazon somewhere and i would say within maybe three days no more you could certainly be in the the most remote place on the planet and leave everything behind and there's nobody who's doing that nobody is going that direction people buy the hundreds of millions are buying one-way tickets into cities why because there are choices the problem with being amish the problem with being a hunter-gatherer is that you have only one occupation you have if you're if you were born with a natural ability for mathematics the violin ballerina science i don't know um anything you're gonna be thwarted you're gonna have to still do what your dad did or your mom did you have no choices you go into the city because even though you're living in a ghetto even though you're living in poverty you still have more choices than what you had living in your village so cities are possibility factories and so people move there because there is some possibility that their unique set of talents can blossom okay that they don't have in the village okay they will suffer through those really dank quarters and that grime where in the village they had a beautiful view and they had organic food and they knew who they were and they have the support of the family why would they leave they're leaving to find themselves to to become something that they could not become in the village to to blossom with those unique set of characteristics that we get from technology and that's what technology gives us it gives us more and more options and so you know somewhere in the world well you know it's like imagine mozart being born before we had invented the symphony what a loss what what what a crime that would have been if he had been born before symphonies and and hunt together we wouldn't have that beautiful music or hitchcock with film that means that today somewhere in the world there's someone born whose technology we have not yet invented who's going to be thwarted who's waiting for us to invent that piano who's been waiting for us to invent that new thing the book whatever it is so that their genius could come out and be shared so we have a moral obligation to make these new things to increase the number of opportunities and to make sure that everybody has the basic ones of you know clean water and education all those basic ones so that everybody in the world born has the possibility to uncover develop and share their genius yeah that's beautifully said you know i think that if on what you're talking about right now is technology as it manifests and creativity and art and beauty and genius in what arthur c clarke said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and then on the other side you have these technologies of destruction you know of what we saw in the mid 20th century of tracing a lot of the artistic movements were backlashes to world war one world war ii and the technologies of destruction and you've been talking a lot about the technologies of creation but are there ways for us to put the genie back in the bottle with technologies of destruction i mean what we've seen is to go back to what you're saying about this weird paradox that nuclear weapons since they were first invented since they were first used have actually made us safer in some way we haven't had another world war and there's something deeply paradoxical about that but still every single day there's like this dark ominous cloud that even if we see blue skies the creation the genius that you're alluding to there's sort of this invisible cloud that hangs over us and i think that we should be quite concerned about that of course yeah um have not yet and never will make a technology that we cannot abuse or weaponize and i've been saying this for a while saying oh and by the way the most powerful technology that we just invented the internet we're going to weaponize right and we're going to abuse it it's going to be it's going to be abused powerfully and this is the thing the more powerful the technology the more powerfully it will be abused that's the nature of it ai man it will be really abused however and this is the curious thing even those abuses of technology are increased choices when the first humanoid picked up a rock and turned it into a hammer either to make a shelter or to kill his brother he suddenly had a new choice he never had before right that choice is good you see what i'm saying even the choice to do evil is itself a good which means that if there's a 50 50 wash between good and evil the fact that there's another choice gives it a one percent edge so there's 51 percent versus 49 percent so that's why i say that given everything even the choices to do evil are good that we have 51 percent good and 49 bad that one or two percent delta that tiny tiny little bit better the incremental creep of goodness and betterment compounded yearly is civilization all we need is to have one percent better what we need to do is create one percent more than we destroy then we have civilization and by the way one percent is almost invisible looking around the world you say it's half of it's crap yes it's true there's only one percent tiny bit but that one percent difference that little tiny bit is all that we need that little tiny bit comes from comes even the evil choices are choices and those choices are good it's good to have a choice and so i am a pro-topian i'm not a utopian i'm pro-topia meaning there is tiny incremental improvement i don't want utopia i'm not a dystopian i'm a pro-topian we're kind of this really kind of a crawl to tiny little tiny improvements over time that are compounded over decades and centuries and that is all that we need so when we look around we can see still of harm and it looks terrible and it is terrible but we have a one percent given the fact that even that choice to do evil is a good how do you understand something so given and i don't mean to come across as a pessimist i'm just really trying to come i don't really understand what you're saying um but take a city like jerusalem we've spent years with that sort of incremental progress building the dome of the rock the the western wall all of these these places where of religious significance of spiritual beauty and my concern is that what technology can do is even if we can have the 5149 all it takes is one destructive moment to basically destroy something and that what technology does is it makes it easier and easier for one person to have destruction whereas somebody with the stone that you were talking about earlier right cain can kill abel but then what happens is we get into guns where guns you could kill with a non-automatic is a semi-automatic gun you can kill just a couple people and then you can have the twin towers and kill thousands of people at once okay so i was concerned about that and i did some research i said what does the evidence show if we take one person has the power has the ability of one person to kill a lot of people increased over time and um the answer is it hasn't so i looked at kind of you know um first of all you know they did twin towers 19 people how many people died uh you know i don't know it's like a 20 to 3 000 that's one in 100 or or whatever it is that ratio an individual person really has not been able to uh kill or ha or i should not be able to has not killed on average more than 100 people set a fire to a building um take the manhattan project the number of people who worked on the manhattan project and the number of people died is still in that same order of magnitude so maybe we can imagine that but if we take the evidence show me the evidence that over time the ability of one person to kill many many people has increased and we can imagine it but again if you go back to the evidence i just don't see it i haven't seen it like you know if you were to kind of play your mind of like well people say well um a bio releasing smallpox okay maybe we could imagine of course it hasn't been done yet here's what i would say about it it's probably much harder than you think it probably requires a lot more people involved to do that it may not even work very well the short answer is that we have no evidence again we have lots of speculation we can kind of imagine it but if you take the evidence show me where one person has killed a million or one person has killed a hundred thousand people or one person has killed ten thousand people you say that all the time the technology is allowing us but it hasn't happened and why is that i'll tell you why as these technologies become more powerful they become more social they actually require more and more to be involved to to make them happen and that social socialness works as the deterrent so you in order to make it make it happen you have to have a much more kind of a larger viewpoint it has to be a bigger idea it has to be more than a rogue individual you need a team or maybe a state because there's these technologies that are powerful we imagine them as being again it's a service of an individual even a nuclear bomb it's probably not going to be a lone person so so i'm only saying yes i can imagine with you but if we look at the data the data does not support your statement interesting so within you know there's this really interesting relationship between technological progress and moral progress and i was thinking a lot about this as i was preparing for our conversation today and i'm gonna pause it something this is where i ended up not thinking about it a lot at all so forgive me if it's wrong but i'm going to throw out a thesis that moral progress doesn't exist nearly as much as we think except for that it follows from technological progress so let me frame this for you and it may very well be wrong that what technological progress does is it gives us wealth and it gives us leverage and because we don't have to deal with the evil inducing elements of scarcity we can then have the privilege to act like less of the hobbesian savages that we maybe are and much more of these good people with good intentions and good morality and that moral progress is in some sense or overrated because it just is a result of technological progress crazy thesis may well be wrong but i want to hear your response to it i i agree with you i agree with you and um again going back to my kind of limited experience with kind of the early past and and their struggles is that um the whole point of methuselah um theory that was a spark for both wallace um charles darwin in the evolutionary theory was the fact that in nature all populations of whatever plant animal and certainly humanoids would would reproduce to the limits of what they could sustain right right so they would always every population would come up to the limits of starvation they were always on the edge of starvation all populations okay they're that's just the nature of how they're gonna they're gonna reproduce until they can't reproduce anymore because they're at the limit so science was the way out of that that was true for humans until fairly recently in any of the contexts kind of of um surplus based civilizations that went and had contacts with people who were still in the subsistence mode always talked about how they were basically always hungry and they were always at the limits and their kids were dying early because they were basically right at that limit so it was only through science and technology that we were able to escape that you know ongoing um pressure and begin to um invent ourselves because we have invented our humanity we invented our sense of fairness we invented all these things and um uh that surplus has given us the ability to not just have to worry about surviving but to um thrive or prosper and change so so we've been changing all along and people don't realize how much we have invented ourselves through the technology of cooking external stomach that will allow us to digest nutrients that we could not digest ourselves which that cooking changed our teeth and changed our jaw we involved lactose tolerance in adults as soon as we domesticated certain animals allowing us to have the benefit nutrition from milk as adults we've been changing our genes the whole way along and we're still in the process of inventing ourselves so that has definitely come from the technological surplus we might want to call it that has only been present in the last you know three or four hundred years and more so today so um i think that as we go forward this arena of our meaning and what humans mean and what humans are about that's going to be our main area of focus of of now that we have surplus now we have too much to eat now we now we have that we have air conditioned boxes that have running water and wi-fi we're going to start to think about well why am i here what am i doing and so we will continue to evolve in the moral dimension in you know those those concentric circles of of of expanding who we think we are um including others of different color maybe including others of different species maybe including the machines so that's um i think you're absolutely right yeah two things came to mind as you said that the first was churchill's idea that first we tape shape our tools then our tools shape us and the second was what i'm going to forever call kevin kelly's hierarchy of spirituality versus maslow's hierarchy of needs i think that's sort of what you're getting to that we can ascend to thinking about these higher questions which leads me to how much of your work is a almost a biography of the future history of tomorrow versus a more science fiction imagining the landscape of tomorrow certainly there's an interplay between them it's not one it's not the other yeah that's a really good question but let me i want to say one thing about the hierarchy because there's something interesting um one of the questions as i spent time traveling but you know uh i have been i think as of next week one year not being on a plane i've not been on the plane for entire year whereas i was on the plane all the time before that and a lot of the time was spent in remote parts of the developing world and one of the questions i was always asking as i traveled around these countries not just in the big cities but trying to get out into the boondocks as much as i could was um is the world converging or israel diverging and i came up with a theory and the theory is going back to maslow's hierarchy which by the way he never used if you've read about that he never talked about the hierarchy but didn't know that yeah but we've applied it it works for him um what i observed was um i believe that around the world there is a convergence on the lower levels of maslow's hierarchy for the basic essentials of shelter food and clothing and you know a airtight air-conditioned apartment with wi-fi that's what everybody in the entire world wants if you ask any young person anywhere that is their dream air-conditioned box running waters plumbing and wi-fi they're going to be really really happy 01:0:0,150 --> 01:0:3,119 01:0:0,160 --> 01:0:3,920 and you know t-shirt and sneakers and 01:0:3,109 --> 01:0:3,920 01:0:3,119 --> 01:0:8,799 fried chicken 01:0:3,910 --> 01:0:8,799 01:0:3,920 --> 01:0:10,559 okay so that's the base so the basic 01:0:8,789 --> 01:0:10,559 01:0:8,799 --> 01:0:12,400 levels of mesolithic are going to 01:0:10,549 --> 01:0:12,400 01:0:10,559 --> 01:0:13,680 converge 01:0:12,390 --> 01:0:13,680 01:0:12,400 --> 01:0:15,839 but i think we're going to see a 01:0:13,670 --> 01:0:15,839 01:0:13,680 --> 01:0:18,319 divergence 01:0:15,829 --> 01:0:18,319 01:0:15,839 --> 01:0:20,079 at the top end about what it means what 01:0:18,309 --> 01:0:20,079 01:0:18,319 --> 01:0:23,040 the purpose is 01:0:20,069 --> 01:0:23,040 01:0:20,079 --> 01:0:24,400 what we're about we're going to see 01:0:23,030 --> 01:0:24,400 01:0:23,040 --> 01:0:27,119 continued 01:0:24,390 --> 01:0:27,119 01:0:24,400 --> 01:0:27,599 increased diversity and those answers to 01:0:27,109 --> 01:0:27,599 01:0:27,119 --> 01:0:30,079 01:0:27,589 --> 01:0:30,079 01:0:27,599 --> 01:0:31,359 you've got the things covered what's 01:0:30,069 --> 01:0:31,359 01:0:30,079 --> 01:0:32,960 this about why are you here what's 01:0:31,349 --> 01:0:32,960 01:0:31,359 --> 01:0:36,480 important 01:0:32,950 --> 01:0:36,480 01:0:32,960 --> 01:0:39,599 and um that 01:0:36,470 --> 01:0:39,599 01:0:36,480 --> 01:0:42,720 is very exciting if that was really true 01:0:39,589 --> 01:0:42,720 01:0:39,599 --> 01:0:44,079 if we really saw yeah at the base level 01:0:42,710 --> 01:0:44,079 01:0:42,720 --> 01:0:46,000 no matter where in the road you travel 01:0:44,069 --> 01:0:46,000 01:0:44,079 --> 01:0:47,200 you go downtown you can't tell where 01:0:45,990 --> 01:0:47,200 01:0:46,000 --> 01:0:49,760 where you are people wearing the same 01:0:47,190 --> 01:0:49,760 01:0:47,200 --> 01:0:52,720 clothes they've got the same stores 01:0:49,750 --> 01:0:52,720 01:0:49,760 --> 01:0:54,400 okay maslow's hierarchy basic things 01:0:52,710 --> 01:0:54,400 01:0:52,720 --> 01:0:55,599 convergence total convergence doesn't 01:0:54,390 --> 01:0:55,599 01:0:54,400 --> 01:0:58,640 matter 01:0:55,589 --> 01:0:58,640 01:0:55,599 --> 01:1:1,119 but what does it mean to us what are we 01:0:58,630 --> 01:1:1,119 01:0:58,640 --> 01:1:3,280 about where are we going with this 01:1:1,109 --> 01:1:3,280 01:1:1,119 --> 01:1:5,040 what's the purpose there we might see 01:1:3,270 --> 01:1:5,040 01:1:3,280 --> 01:1:8,079 huge divergence 01:1:5,030 --> 01:1:8,079 01:1:5,040 --> 01:1:11,520 and i think that would be a good thing 01:1:8,069 --> 01:1:11,520 01:1:8,079 --> 01:1:14,000 yeah you mentioned this in the 01:1:11,510 --> 01:1:14,000 01:1:11,520 --> 01:1:16,240 way that christianity is splintering 01:1:13,990 --> 01:1:16,240 01:1:14,000 --> 01:1:17,520 into all different ways of thinking 01:1:16,230 --> 01:1:17,520 01:1:16,240 --> 01:1:20,480 about the faith right 01:1:17,510 --> 01:1:20,480 01:1:17,520 --> 01:1:22,240 right exactly so let me go back to your 01:1:20,470 --> 01:1:22,240 01:1:20,480 --> 01:1:26,079 question about um 01:1:22,230 --> 01:1:26,079 01:1:22,240 --> 01:1:28,160 yeah imagination versus truth so so um 01:1:26,069 --> 01:1:28,160 01:1:26,079 --> 01:1:29,520 i i i've been kind of talking about the 01:1:28,150 --> 01:1:29,520 01:1:28,160 --> 01:1:30,799 future long enough to know that 01:1:29,510 --> 01:1:30,799 01:1:29,520 --> 01:1:33,119 whatever i say about the future will be 01:1:30,789 --> 01:1:33,119 01:1:30,799 --> 01:1:35,040 wrong you really can't protect the 01:1:33,109 --> 01:1:35,040 01:1:33,119 --> 01:1:37,040 future it's way too complicated 01:1:35,030 --> 01:1:37,040 01:1:35,040 --> 01:1:38,319 again as i was saying you could the best 01:1:37,030 --> 01:1:38,319 01:1:37,040 --> 01:1:40,640 you can do is kind of 01:1:38,309 --> 01:1:40,640 01:1:38,319 --> 01:1:41,839 talk about the outer realm of what's 01:1:40,630 --> 01:1:41,839 01:1:40,640 --> 01:1:44,000 01:1:41,829 --> 01:1:44,000 01:1:41,839 --> 01:1:45,119 and then not be surprised by it but but 01:1:43,990 --> 01:1:45,119 01:1:44,000 --> 01:1:46,720 it's it's 01:1:45,109 --> 01:1:46,720 01:1:45,119 --> 01:1:48,319 these complex systems are just 01:1:46,710 --> 01:1:48,319 01:1:46,720 --> 01:1:52,000 inherently stochastic 01:1:48,309 --> 01:1:52,000 01:1:48,319 --> 01:1:54,240 they're inherently unpredictable 01:1:51,990 --> 01:1:54,240 01:1:52,000 --> 01:1:56,319 and um the harder the further out we go 01:1:54,230 --> 01:1:56,319 01:1:54,240 --> 01:2:1,039 the harder it is however 01:1:56,309 --> 01:2:1,039 01:1:56,319 --> 01:2:4,480 i do believe that there are trends 01:2:1,029 --> 01:2:4,480 01:2:1,039 --> 01:2:8,720 that are built into the very nature of 01:2:4,470 --> 01:2:8,720 01:2:4,480 --> 01:2:12,720 the physics of in chemistry that will 01:2:8,710 --> 01:2:12,720 01:2:8,720 --> 01:2:15,440 dictate a certain course of development 01:2:12,710 --> 01:2:15,440 01:2:12,720 --> 01:2:16,319 in technology meaning that my bet is if 01:2:15,430 --> 01:2:16,319 01:2:15,440 --> 01:2:19,280 we talk 01:2:16,309 --> 01:2:19,280 01:2:16,319 --> 01:2:20,000 to all the other civilizations in our 01:2:19,270 --> 01:2:20,000 01:2:19,280 --> 01:2:23,119 galaxy 01:2:19,990 --> 01:2:23,119 01:2:20,000 --> 01:2:25,760 we would begin to see that there is a 01:2:23,109 --> 01:2:25,760 01:2:23,119 --> 01:2:27,039 developmental pattern that civilizations 01:2:25,750 --> 01:2:27,039 01:2:25,760 --> 01:2:30,480 would go through that they would 01:2:27,029 --> 01:2:30,480 01:2:27,039 --> 01:2:31,440 you know do sowing and then pottery and 01:2:30,470 --> 01:2:31,440 01:2:30,480 --> 01:2:33,200 you know that there would be a 01:2:31,430 --> 01:2:33,200 01:2:31,440 --> 01:2:34,400 progression and they would as soon as 01:2:33,190 --> 01:2:34,400 01:2:33,200 --> 01:2:36,960 they invented 01:2:34,390 --> 01:2:36,960 01:2:34,400 --> 01:2:38,400 radio waves they would have the 01:2:36,950 --> 01:2:38,400 01:2:36,960 --> 01:2:39,440 satellites you know and you would go 01:2:38,390 --> 01:2:39,440 01:2:38,400 --> 01:2:42,160 through a certain 01:2:39,430 --> 01:2:42,160 01:2:39,440 --> 01:2:42,559 progression like you would develop any 01:2:42,150 --> 01:2:42,559 01:2:42,160 --> 01:2:45,760 other 01:2:42,549 --> 01:2:45,760 01:2:42,559 --> 01:2:48,960 um organism and that is because 01:2:45,750 --> 01:2:48,960 01:2:45,760 --> 01:2:49,760 there's constraints about what can 01:2:48,950 --> 01:2:49,760 01:2:48,960 --> 01:2:52,880 happen 01:2:49,750 --> 01:2:52,880 01:2:49,760 --> 01:2:54,400 just in the physical world as an aside 01:2:52,870 --> 01:2:54,400 01:2:52,880 --> 01:2:56,000 which we come back to later i think the 01:2:54,390 --> 01:2:56,000 01:2:54,400 --> 01:3:0,000 most remarkable 01:2:55,990 --> 01:3:0,000 01:2:56,000 --> 01:3:2,559 molecule in the universe is dna 01:2:59,990 --> 01:3:2,559 01:3:0,000 --> 01:3:4,319 there aren't very many molecules in the 01:3:2,549 --> 01:3:4,319 01:3:2,559 --> 01:3:6,960 universe that are possible to 01:3:4,309 --> 01:3:6,960 01:3:4,319 --> 01:3:7,359 arrange themselves in sufficient numbers 01:3:6,950 --> 01:3:7,359 01:3:6,960 --> 01:3:10,240 01:3:7,349 --> 01:3:10,240 01:3:7,359 --> 01:3:11,839 stable variations that could build upon 01:3:10,230 --> 01:3:11,839 01:3:10,240 --> 01:3:15,680 each other 01:3:11,829 --> 01:3:15,680 01:3:11,839 --> 01:3:19,119 there may be two or three there may be 01:3:15,670 --> 01:3:19,119 01:3:15,680 --> 01:3:20,880 more of them that we could invent 01:3:19,109 --> 01:3:20,880 01:3:19,119 --> 01:3:22,799 but there's only one or two that could 01:3:20,870 --> 01:3:22,799 01:3:20,880 --> 01:3:24,880 self-organize at the same time so this 01:3:22,789 --> 01:3:24,880 01:3:22,799 --> 01:3:26,720 is a molecule not only 01:3:24,870 --> 01:3:26,720 01:3:24,880 --> 01:3:28,240 does it have this kind of flexibility 01:3:26,710 --> 01:3:28,240 01:3:26,720 --> 01:3:31,520 and stability at the same time 01:3:28,230 --> 01:3:31,520 01:3:28,240 --> 01:3:33,920 but can self-organize that there's just 01:3:31,510 --> 01:3:33,920 01:3:31,520 --> 01:3:34,720 we've looked and there just aren't that 01:3:33,910 --> 01:3:34,720 01:3:33,920 --> 01:3:38,480 many 01:3:34,710 --> 01:3:38,480 01:3:34,720 --> 01:3:40,680 choices so that suggests that even other 01:3:38,470 --> 01:3:40,680 01:3:38,480 --> 01:3:42,240 life in the universe is likely to be 01:3:40,670 --> 01:3:42,240 01:3:40,680 --> 01:3:45,200 dna-ish 01:3:42,230 --> 01:3:45,200 01:3:42,240 --> 01:3:45,839 that's a controversial statement but if 01:3:45,190 --> 01:3:45,839 01:3:45,200 --> 01:3:47,599 that's so 01:3:45,829 --> 01:3:47,599 01:3:45,839 --> 01:3:49,119 and particularly that so i think there 01:3:47,589 --> 01:3:49,119 01:3:47,599 --> 01:3:52,480 is kind 01:3:49,109 --> 01:3:52,480 01:3:49,119 --> 01:3:55,520 of um constraints positive constraints 01:3:52,470 --> 01:3:55,520 01:3:52,480 --> 01:3:58,400 on what is possible so 01:3:55,510 --> 01:3:58,400 01:3:55,520 --> 01:3:59,760 if we had more of a data set we could 01:3:58,390 --> 01:3:59,760 01:3:58,400 --> 01:4:0,960 say more about 01:3:59,750 --> 01:4:0,960 01:3:59,760 --> 01:4:2,880 where things were going because we'd 01:4:0,950 --> 01:4:2,880 01:4:0,960 --> 01:4:6,480 have more than n1 case but 01:4:2,870 --> 01:4:6,480 01:4:2,880 --> 01:4:11,280 with n1 we can't really predict but 01:4:6,470 --> 01:4:11,280 01:4:6,480 --> 01:4:13,920 we can try to not be surprised however 01:4:11,270 --> 01:4:13,920 01:4:11,280 --> 01:4:15,119 i do know that when we want to make 01:4:13,910 --> 01:4:15,119 01:4:13,920 --> 01:4:17,440 01:4:15,109 --> 01:4:17,440 01:4:15,119 --> 01:4:20,880 complicated something good that's 01:4:17,430 --> 01:4:20,880 01:4:17,440 --> 01:4:24,160 complicated and very very complex 01:4:20,870 --> 01:4:24,160 01:4:20,880 --> 01:4:27,440 that it becomes it's easier to do if we 01:4:24,150 --> 01:4:27,440 01:4:24,160 --> 01:4:29,520 imagine it first 01:4:27,430 --> 01:4:29,520 01:4:27,440 --> 01:4:31,359 it's really hard to kind of go to a very 01:4:29,510 --> 01:4:31,359 01:4:29,520 --> 01:4:32,240 complicated future that we don't imagine 01:4:31,349 --> 01:4:32,240 01:4:31,359 --> 01:4:35,440 01:4:32,230 --> 01:4:35,440 01:4:32,240 --> 01:4:36,559 that we're going to get there so i 01:4:35,430 --> 01:4:36,559 01:4:35,440 --> 01:4:39,119 believe 01:4:36,549 --> 01:4:39,119 01:4:36,559 --> 01:4:41,440 that what i'm trying to do is really not 01:4:39,109 --> 01:4:41,440 01:4:39,119 --> 01:4:43,359 to predict the future but to imagine 01:4:41,430 --> 01:4:43,359 01:4:41,440 --> 01:4:46,240 a positive future that we want to aim 01:4:43,349 --> 01:4:46,240 01:4:43,359 --> 01:4:49,760 for because what hollywood gives us 01:4:46,230 --> 01:4:49,760 01:4:46,240 --> 01:4:52,839 the most science fiction is dystopia 01:4:49,750 --> 01:4:52,839 01:4:49,760 --> 01:4:54,960 it's actually very hard to imagine any 01:4:52,829 --> 01:4:54,960 01:4:52,839 --> 01:4:57,520 positive scenario 01:4:54,950 --> 01:4:57,520 01:4:54,960 --> 01:4:59,599 of the future that's on the planet earth 01:4:57,510 --> 01:4:59,599 01:4:57,520 --> 01:5:3,520 the star trek doesn't count 01:4:59,589 --> 01:5:3,520 01:4:59,599 --> 01:5:5,599 that's positive and 01:5:3,510 --> 01:5:5,599 01:5:3,520 --> 01:5:8,079 i think that makes it harder to arrive 01:5:5,589 --> 01:5:8,079 01:5:5,599 --> 01:5:9,839 there and i have to say though that 01:5:8,069 --> 01:5:9,839 01:5:8,079 --> 01:5:12,000 trying to imagine a future where there's 01:5:9,829 --> 01:5:12,000 01:5:9,839 --> 01:5:14,559 ubiquitous ai and 01:5:11,990 --> 01:5:14,559 01:5:12,000 --> 01:5:15,359 commonplace genetic engineering and 01:5:14,549 --> 01:5:15,359 01:5:14,559 --> 01:5:17,760 constant 01:5:15,349 --> 01:5:17,760 01:5:15,359 --> 01:5:19,119 tracking of everything it's hard to 01:5:17,750 --> 01:5:19,119 01:5:17,760 --> 01:5:21,200 imagine a future 01:5:19,109 --> 01:5:21,200 01:5:19,119 --> 01:5:22,160 that we want from that but i don't think 01:5:21,190 --> 01:5:22,160 01:5:21,200 --> 01:5:24,799 it's impossible 01:5:22,150 --> 01:5:24,799 01:5:22,160 --> 01:5:25,440 i just think that we have to get better 01:5:24,789 --> 01:5:25,440 01:5:24,799 --> 01:5:29,359 at 01:5:25,430 --> 01:5:29,359 01:5:25,440 --> 01:5:32,640 imagining it and so um you're right 01:5:29,349 --> 01:5:32,640 01:5:29,359 --> 01:5:33,280 that i see my role not in trying to 01:5:32,630 --> 01:5:33,280 01:5:32,640 --> 01:5:36,960 predict 01:5:33,270 --> 01:5:36,960 01:5:33,280 --> 01:5:40,079 and be correct but to try to help us 01:5:36,950 --> 01:5:40,079 01:5:36,960 --> 01:5:43,200 imagine a positive future that we want 01:5:40,069 --> 01:5:43,200 01:5:40,079 --> 01:5:45,599 yeah you know i want to ask you about a 01:5:43,190 --> 01:5:45,599 01:5:43,200 --> 01:5:47,440 specific article that you wrote 01:5:45,589 --> 01:5:47,440 01:5:45,599 --> 01:5:49,119 because for me it's the best thing 01:5:47,430 --> 01:5:49,119 01:5:47,440 --> 01:5:51,200 you've ever written by far 01:5:49,109 --> 01:5:51,200 01:5:49,119 --> 01:5:52,319 not because the other things aren't good 01:5:51,190 --> 01:5:52,319 01:5:51,200 --> 01:5:54,400 but because this 01:5:52,309 --> 01:5:54,400 01:5:52,319 --> 01:5:55,599 is just a stellar piece of work that i 01:5:54,390 --> 01:5:55,599 01:5:54,400 --> 01:5:57,760 always come back to 01:5:55,589 --> 01:5:57,760 01:5:55,599 --> 01:5:59,119 and that's new rules for the new economy 01:5:57,750 --> 01:5:59,119 01:5:57,760 --> 01:6:1,680 you wrote an article 01:5:59,109 --> 01:6:1,680 01:5:59,119 --> 01:6:2,559 that spoke about how networks will 01:6:1,670 --> 01:6:2,559 01:6:1,680 --> 01:6:4,720 unfold 01:6:2,549 --> 01:6:4,720 01:6:2,559 --> 01:6:6,160 and i have read that thing so many times 01:6:4,710 --> 01:6:6,160 01:6:4,720 --> 01:6:9,119 and made specific 01:6:6,150 --> 01:6:9,119 01:6:6,160 --> 01:6:9,680 bets in my career around the truth of 01:6:9,109 --> 01:6:9,680 01:6:9,119 --> 01:6:13,520 01:6:9,670 --> 01:6:13,520 01:6:9,680 --> 01:6:15,599 of that article and the one that 01:6:13,510 --> 01:6:15,599 01:6:13,520 --> 01:6:17,039 i really appreciate a single sentence in 01:6:15,589 --> 01:6:17,039 01:6:15,599 --> 01:6:19,440 the network economy 01:6:17,029 --> 01:6:19,440 01:6:17,039 --> 01:6:20,720 the separation between customers and a 01:6:19,430 --> 01:6:20,720 01:6:19,440 --> 01:6:22,880 firm's employees 01:6:20,710 --> 01:6:22,880 01:6:20,720 --> 01:6:25,119 often vanishes i mean you see that with 01:6:22,870 --> 01:6:25,119 01:6:22,880 --> 01:6:28,400 tesla you see that with apple 01:6:25,109 --> 01:6:28,400 01:6:25,119 --> 01:6:29,599 and you see it all over the place and my 01:6:28,390 --> 01:6:29,599 01:6:28,400 --> 01:6:32,559 question 01:6:29,589 --> 01:6:32,559 01:6:29,599 --> 01:6:34,319 is how much in an article like that is 01:6:32,549 --> 01:6:34,319 01:6:32,559 --> 01:6:36,640 predicting the future 01:6:34,309 --> 01:6:36,640 01:6:34,319 --> 01:6:38,240 versus understanding the present in such 01:6:36,630 --> 01:6:38,240 01:6:36,640 --> 01:6:40,160 a lucid way 01:6:38,230 --> 01:6:40,160 01:6:38,240 --> 01:6:42,160 that you're just describing what's 01:6:40,150 --> 01:6:42,160 01:6:40,160 --> 01:6:44,240 happening now but to everybody else that 01:6:42,150 --> 01:6:44,240 01:6:42,160 --> 01:6:47,839 looks like futurology 01:6:44,230 --> 01:6:47,839 01:6:44,240 --> 01:6:49,520 right you you nailed that's that's 01:6:47,829 --> 01:6:49,520 01:6:47,839 --> 01:6:51,280 that's the best way to put it is that 01:6:49,510 --> 01:6:51,280 01:6:49,520 --> 01:6:52,559 i'm not 01:6:51,270 --> 01:6:52,559 01:6:51,280 --> 01:6:54,480 predicting the future i'm actually 01:6:52,549 --> 01:6:54,480 01:6:52,559 --> 01:6:55,839 trying to just predict the present i'm 01:6:54,470 --> 01:6:55,839 01:6:54,480 --> 01:6:59,440 trying to describe 01:6:55,829 --> 01:6:59,440 01:6:55,839 --> 01:7:2,319 the present clear enough to to say 01:6:59,430 --> 01:7:2,319 01:6:59,440 --> 01:7:4,160 this is what's happening now in its 01:7:2,309 --> 01:7:4,160 01:7:2,319 --> 01:7:4,960 early forms but this is the way it's 01:7:4,150 --> 01:7:4,960 01:7:4,160 --> 01:7:6,640 leaning 01:7:4,950 --> 01:7:6,640 01:7:4,960 --> 01:7:8,160 so i so i see technologies having 01:7:6,630 --> 01:7:8,160 01:7:6,640 --> 01:7:10,799 leanings or biases 01:7:8,150 --> 01:7:10,799 01:7:8,160 --> 01:7:11,680 right and you know the other example was 01:7:10,789 --> 01:7:11,680 01:7:10,799 --> 01:7:14,799 uh 01:7:11,670 --> 01:7:14,799 01:7:11,680 --> 01:7:16,960 the internet wants to copy things well 01:7:14,789 --> 01:7:16,960 01:7:14,799 --> 01:7:18,160 you know my early experience on the well 01:7:16,950 --> 01:7:18,160 01:7:16,960 --> 01:7:19,599 and other places was 01:7:18,150 --> 01:7:19,599 01:7:18,160 --> 01:7:20,799 oh these copies when it copies it's 01:7:19,589 --> 01:7:20,799 01:7:19,599 --> 01:7:21,680 really hard to stop copying everything 01:7:20,789 --> 01:7:21,680 01:7:20,799 --> 01:7:25,520 wants a copy 01:7:21,670 --> 01:7:25,520 01:7:21,680 --> 01:7:27,280 what's that about so if you if you watch 01:7:25,510 --> 01:7:27,280 01:7:25,520 --> 01:7:28,640 people actually do the things and not 01:7:27,270 --> 01:7:28,640 01:7:27,280 --> 01:7:30,160 what you think they should be doing but 01:7:28,630 --> 01:7:30,160 01:7:28,640 --> 01:7:33,119 what they actually do 01:7:30,150 --> 01:7:33,119 01:7:30,160 --> 01:7:33,839 you get this feeling that that's because 01:7:33,109 --> 01:7:33,839 01:7:33,119 --> 01:7:35,760 there's a 01:7:33,829 --> 01:7:35,760 01:7:33,839 --> 01:7:37,920 bias in the technology the technology 01:7:35,750 --> 01:7:37,920 01:7:35,760 --> 01:7:40,160 kind of wants to wants to make copies 01:7:37,910 --> 01:7:40,160 01:7:37,920 --> 01:7:41,520 and so we ask ourselves this kind of 01:7:40,150 --> 01:7:41,520 01:7:40,160 --> 01:7:42,079 anthropomorphic thing what does the 01:7:41,510 --> 01:7:42,079 01:7:41,520 --> 01:7:44,319 technology 01:7:42,069 --> 01:7:44,319 01:7:42,079 --> 01:7:45,359 want it's it's a kind of a it's a you 01:7:44,309 --> 01:7:45,359 01:7:44,319 --> 01:7:48,400 know it's a 01:7:45,349 --> 01:7:48,400 01:7:45,359 --> 01:7:50,720 trope it's it's a it's a hack 01:7:48,390 --> 01:7:50,720 01:7:48,400 --> 01:7:52,160 it's not really true but it's it's 01:7:50,710 --> 01:7:52,160 01:7:50,720 --> 01:7:53,760 useful to kind of 01:7:52,150 --> 01:7:53,760 01:7:52,160 --> 01:7:55,359 say well there's a bias in which way is 01:7:53,750 --> 01:7:55,359 01:7:53,760 --> 01:7:56,960 it leaning and so 01:7:55,349 --> 01:7:56,960 01:7:55,359 --> 01:7:59,359 what i try to do is kind of like i say 01:7:56,950 --> 01:7:59,359 01:7:56,960 --> 01:8:1,760 listen to the technology which is like 01:7:59,349 --> 01:8:1,760 01:7:59,359 --> 01:8:4,160 where is it tending to what what's it 01:8:1,750 --> 01:8:4,160 01:8:1,760 --> 01:8:6,000 biased and and people's habits that they 01:8:4,150 --> 01:8:6,000 01:8:4,160 --> 01:8:7,680 actually use things 01:8:5,990 --> 01:8:7,680 01:8:6,000 --> 01:8:9,599 not how they're invented what people 01:8:7,670 --> 01:8:9,599 01:8:7,680 --> 01:8:11,599 think they're invented for not what 01:8:9,589 --> 01:8:11,599 01:8:9,599 --> 01:8:13,440 not what mark zuckerberg thought that 01:8:11,589 --> 01:8:13,440 01:8:11,599 --> 01:8:15,520 people were going to use 01:8:13,430 --> 01:8:15,520 01:8:13,440 --> 01:8:16,719 facebook for but what do they actually 01:8:15,510 --> 01:8:16,719 01:8:15,520 --> 01:8:19,199 use it for 01:8:16,709 --> 01:8:19,199 01:8:16,719 --> 01:8:20,159 and what is that can we generalize that 01:8:19,189 --> 01:8:20,159 01:8:19,199 --> 01:8:23,279 is there something 01:8:20,149 --> 01:8:23,279 01:8:20,159 --> 01:8:24,560 general about it that what's just 01:8:23,269 --> 01:8:24,560 01:8:23,279 --> 01:8:26,319 where it might be headed but we're 01:8:24,550 --> 01:8:26,319 01:8:24,560 --> 01:8:30,080 really trying to describe 01:8:26,309 --> 01:8:30,080 01:8:26,319 --> 01:8:30,640 or see or notice what's happening right 01:8:30,070 --> 01:8:30,640 01:8:30,080 --> 01:8:32,319 now 01:8:30,630 --> 01:8:32,319 01:8:30,640 --> 01:8:34,000 i'm just saying it's kind of like saying 01:8:32,309 --> 01:8:34,000 01:8:32,319 --> 01:8:37,520 well given what we see 01:8:33,990 --> 01:8:37,520 01:8:34,000 --> 01:8:40,000 we're going to lean in this direction so 01:8:37,510 --> 01:8:40,000 01:8:37,520 --> 01:8:40,640 um that's the best i think we can do in 01:8:39,990 --> 01:8:40,640 01:8:40,000 --> 01:8:43,520 terms of 01:8:40,630 --> 01:8:43,520 01:8:40,640 --> 01:8:45,600 predicting things is to predict the 01:8:43,510 --> 01:8:45,600 01:8:43,520 --> 01:8:47,839 future and say 01:8:45,590 --> 01:8:47,839 01:8:45,600 --> 01:8:49,440 um you know all things considered it's 01:8:47,829 --> 01:8:49,440 01:8:47,839 --> 01:8:53,600 going to lean in this direction 01:8:49,430 --> 01:8:53,600 01:8:49,440 --> 01:8:56,159 yeah i love that word biases 01:8:53,590 --> 01:8:56,159 01:8:53,600 --> 01:8:58,000 and i think that a word that might 01:8:56,149 --> 01:8:58,000 01:8:56,159 --> 01:9:0,239 illuminate 01:8:57,990 --> 01:9:0,239 01:8:58,000 --> 01:9:2,239 what you're saying there is gravity and 01:9:0,229 --> 01:9:2,239 01:9:0,239 --> 01:9:2,960 so you could have this technological 01:9:2,229 --> 01:9:2,960 01:9:2,239 --> 01:9:6,080 gravity 01:9:2,950 --> 01:9:6,080 01:9:2,960 --> 01:9:8,239 and it works in two ways across two axes 01:9:6,070 --> 01:9:8,239 01:9:6,080 --> 01:9:9,440 the first is the number of people using 01:9:8,229 --> 01:9:9,440 01:9:8,239 --> 01:9:11,600 01:9:9,430 --> 01:9:11,600 01:9:9,440 --> 01:9:13,040 and the second is how long they use that 01:9:11,590 --> 01:9:13,040 01:9:11,600 --> 01:9:15,520 technology for 01:9:13,030 --> 01:9:15,520 01:9:13,040 --> 01:9:16,319 and so i think that to throw something 01:9:15,510 --> 01:9:16,319 01:9:15,520 --> 01:9:19,440 out 01:9:16,309 --> 01:9:19,440 01:9:16,319 --> 01:9:21,920 is what the gravity is doing is like if 01:9:19,430 --> 01:9:21,920 01:9:19,440 --> 01:9:24,000 you were to go as far out you would have 01:9:21,910 --> 01:9:24,000 01:9:21,920 --> 01:9:26,400 billions of people using that technology 01:9:23,990 --> 01:9:26,400 01:9:24,000 --> 01:9:28,400 over a thousand years 01:9:26,390 --> 01:9:28,400 01:9:26,400 --> 01:9:29,600 maybe then you have these inevitable 01:9:28,390 --> 01:9:29,600 01:9:28,400 --> 01:9:32,799 results 01:9:29,590 --> 01:9:32,799 01:9:29,600 --> 01:9:34,000 due to the biases of technology provided 01:9:32,789 --> 01:9:34,000 01:9:32,799 --> 01:9:37,120 that they don't change all 01:9:33,990 --> 01:9:37,120 01:9:34,000 --> 01:9:37,600 things being equal but then if it is one 01:9:37,110 --> 01:9:37,600 01:9:37,120 --> 01:9:40,400 01:9:37,590 --> 01:9:40,400 01:9:37,600 --> 01:9:41,440 over one day those biases don't show up 01:9:40,390 --> 01:9:41,440 01:9:40,400 --> 01:9:43,520 themselves 01:9:41,430 --> 01:9:43,520 01:9:41,440 --> 01:9:45,040 and one of the biases that i'm very 01:9:43,510 --> 01:9:45,040 01:9:43,520 --> 01:9:48,640 interested in 01:9:45,030 --> 01:9:48,640 01:9:45,040 --> 01:9:51,440 is reading on different 01:9:48,630 --> 01:9:51,440 01:9:48,640 --> 01:9:52,159 pieces of media if i read on my phone 01:9:51,430 --> 01:9:52,159 01:9:51,440 --> 01:9:54,800 there is 01:9:52,149 --> 01:9:54,800 01:9:52,159 --> 01:9:55,679 no way in the world that i'm going to 01:9:54,790 --> 01:9:55,679 01:9:54,800 --> 01:9:58,239 get through a whole 01:9:55,669 --> 01:9:58,239 01:9:55,679 --> 01:9:59,280 chapter of a book on my kindle no way 01:9:58,229 --> 01:9:59,280 01:9:58,239 --> 01:10:0,960 but somehow 01:9:59,270 --> 01:10:0,960 01:9:59,280 --> 01:10:2,480 something translates when i get to my ipad where i can do it maybe but there's no way i could get through three chapters whereas i if i leave my phone upstairs and i go downstairs and i open up actual i can get through a couple chapters no problem and so you see there that there's sort of different biases of focus and distraction and what the phone does versus even say an ipad even though they have the same capabilities the way that the media is actually biased makes you more social on your phone and more consumptive on your ipad exactly and you could imagine a bunch of engineers deciding that they were going to try to make a device that would really focus your reading and make it even easier than a book there may not be a huge economic incentive for them to do that but that's possible you could have something that's really biased to reading even more than incoming pages it's like well how could you make a book even more bookish than it is send someone to an island in the middle of the ocean with no wi-fi that's how you get a code of silence whatever it is it could be there could be lots of things but um i think your your image of the of gravity is a really good one because they have another related image which is that um there there is there is a kind of a gravity and is this one of the ways we can kind of look where technology is going in this biases and and the analogy the visual analogy i use is imagine a valley a landscape valley and it's raining and those drops are coming down and landing on the hillside and the one drop is landing on a ridge of the mountain and that drop is the course of that drop as it comes down to the river is unpredictable you can't predict where that drop is going to go but you can predict one thing gravity will take it down the direction is inevitable right okay so that's the level at which we can talk about the future of technology we can say here's the direction it's inevitable we can't we can't describe the path as specifics right we can talk about directions right okay and so um so and that's because of the gravity so i think there are gravities that pull and we can't talk about specifics how it's going to you know what the what the particular product is what company will win all those specifics are completely inherently unpredictable but the direction down towards gravity may be very clear yeah i heard a good one one time that the arrows of directional progress and computing are going towards closer and closer to the body like my watch right like my phone and ever and ever smaller one of the things where does that end the end's inside you right exactly right right so it starts at the refrigerator you know at a distance and in the room and then refrigerator level then next to you on the desk then on top of your desk and it sits in your lap then it hops in your pocket then it's on your wrist and next is like gonna go inside yeah your brain or whatever or here's here's mine here's my version of that or we're going to go inside of it and that's ar and that's ar and vr oh interesting so we actually go inside the computer so the computer is around us it surrounds us that's what the special computing the mirror world is where we actually become so close to us we can't get any closer so we actually go inside the computer and the computers around us you know that's something i'm really looking forward to because there is something so not tactile about the screen and it's funny because we're actually moving into a place where i think the world is ready for this sort of tactility of the screen if you watch kids go to a museum what do they want to do they want to touch and i think that there's actually this frustration i see it with a lot of people actually who have spent a lot of time working with machinery working with tools and then get away and have to spend their whole lives on the computer and the way that they can actually touch forms and stuff becomes really frustrating and when i was a kid one of the things i always wanted to do was dive through the television screen and go be there but that is sort of what you're saying with virtual reality that is what it becomes it becomes a place where you can actually pierce through the screen into that environment and begin to touch everything i think that's a really important aspect of what vr is we always think of vr something that covers the eyes but in reality the hands and the smells are really what are going to make that technology transformative right right so so the guys who study this say that the visual is only 50 the other 50 is the tactile the audio sensing and um uh ar versus vr augmented reality where you wear the clear smart class and see the real world is part of that so so there you're not even blocking out you're s you're seeing and hearing the real world in addition to this overlay of the virtual one-to-one world and that but you're still inside the computer because the computer in the general is watching all your movements and is reading the world it's machine readable and so you are inside of your machine readable so that is it's vr and ar what they call xr either one of those um that is where it becomes so close to us that we're actually go inside and we flip flip around inside and and i think that's people ask me what's after smartphones i think smart glasses are the thing after smartphones for you you wrote a post with 68 pieces of unsolicited advice and one of them was that you don't you really don't want to be famous read the biography of any famous person but you at some level have fame i mean i'm psyched to be talking to you right now because of your fame so what is the optimal level of fame and is that a gradient or what were you referring to there because at some level being famous founding wired you have some level of notoriety but maybe that's not fame yeah i have i have a little touch of fame in china where i'm a rock star and i have bodyguards nice and i'm working on the street that's what i mean by fame where you're kind of the the the the definition and the problem of fame yeah is that you are recognized to an where you are not allowed to make mistakes beautifully said okay so you can't make mistakes in your social life you can't make mistakes in your creative life that's fame and you're constrained by that and it's terrible and this is the thing it's not the paparazzi that's the problem it's not you know having people follow you or stalk you it's the fact that you are no longer allowed the courtesy or the liberty to make right to try something that doesn't work fail in some way to have a friendship break up whatever it is and so um that's what i call fame and toxic fame and it's and it's something that you know you would get if you everybody recognized you is is that you could try something somewhere and and a lot of the people who are famous lament the fact of the early days when they were trying things and nobody cared and that's when all the great stuff happened and i am really impressed with people who are famous and continue to make really good stuff like say bob dylan in part because they become recluses in some ways they they they hide themselves from that fame in order try to be able to do the things that you need to do in being creative which is have failures yeah that really goes back to some of the things that we were talking about earlier with government and companies right right so so you know one of the things i say about government is that the business of government is to be inefficient we saw that from covid no business no real business run by competent people would allow itself to stockpile 50 million um masks just in case you know you can't you can't have extra nursing staff that's not being used just in case but that's what you want government to do you want government to stockpile all these things buffer in a very inefficient way you want them to have extra surplus and having us you know whatever it is just like old egypt with the pharaoh and the grains for the lean years you want that's inefficient and no company that a real company can afford to do that but that's what we want to have governments do they want to be inefficient in that sense of having that kind of capacity and that also investing into things that aren't going to pay out for 10 years or 20 years that's inefficient and um that's the role of government is and that's what makes it conservative is governments aren't allowed to make mistakes or you know they can't be efficient so so we lament and we cry and we criticize them and we taunt them because they aren't innovative and stuff but that's their purpose in some ways we want to have institutions that do that and we particularly want to have institutions that take a long-term view and this is sort of the whole business of the long now foundation of we want institutions that are good ancestors we want to be good ancestors we want to be able to do things that may take more than our own lifetime to finish that's not efficient by the way okay that's another inefficiency so we have to judge things on a kind of a different time scale but that's part of what governments should be doing and that's part of what businesses you know should not be doing but one of the things that um i think a lot about these days is this issue of efficiency because in silicon valley there is a culture of optimization right okay and so oftentimes efficiency is optimized that's what we're optimizing for and i think that's good and necessary um but there should be other parts where we're not trying to optimize efficiency because i actually think inefficiency is part of the origin of creativity and human experience no doubt right now what we're doing is not very efficient right we're chatting we're digressing we got tangents you know we've got pauses um um you know we're totally inefficient by the way right but that's the beauty of it that's that's what we love and science is terribly inefficient think of all those experiments that don't work you know if you were kind of like optimizing it you would say well don't don't do the experiments that don't work don't have failures just try stuff that you know we're going to work innovation entrepreneurs making prototypes those are all all inefficient having dead end pivoting terribly inefficient why don't you just aim what you want for and just go right there no no no art is inefficient nobody ranked picasso and how many paintings per hour he's churning out right so so the discovery adventure every single of the things that we really value as humans is terribly inefficient so what i say is efficiency is for robots efficiency is for ai humans are about inefficiency and what we want to value and what we want to emphasize and what we want to cultivate are all the things that are inefficient none so it doesn't say that all inefficient things or things are desirable but a lot of the desirable things are inefficient and so we have to be careful in our culture of optimization that we're not optimizing efficiency for all things because that is robotic that's productivity is for robots all right we want to be going in another direction of things we want to optimize something else we want to optimize opportunities choices possibilities innovation novelty all those kinds of things yeah you know love optimize love those none of those are very efficient yeah i this this leads me into i want to talk a little bit about writing with you because you've written so many books that have been hits and that i think more importantly have been ways that you've taken the hazy ideas in your brain and turned them into concrete words on a page so much so that you go to china and people recognize you on the streets i mean who cares about the sort of external stuff but the fact that you have documented so many of these ideas on paper so that we can share them and pass them along for generations you know is is is beautiful and i think that this is one of the things within writing that i struggle with so much you know most of the words that i put on the page i end up deleting i end up pressing that backspace button and it goes and they leave the page and how do you think about efficiency in your own writing process you know one of the things i found is we're talking about conversation i think the reason why we love conversation is like you said not because it's efficient but because on the inverse side of efficient is randomness and at some level that randomness leads to serendipity and serendipity leads to generativity and generativity leads to that innovation and i always find that my best ideas at least the ones that help me cross the adaptive valley that help me see sites anew come through conversations but conversations are extremely inefficient my question for you here is how do you think about efficiency in your own writing process i you spent at some point six months researching virtual reality in a feature piece for wired that's inefficient right yeah well first of all i i my own conception of myself is much more as an editor than a writer i love to edit and i hate to write i don't like writing i procrastinate writing i write out of desperation and i write primarily to discover what i think i don't have access to what i think until i try to write it i think i know what i think but i realize i don't know what i think until i try to write it and that's when i realize i don't know what i think and so i have to go back and do more research and think about it some more so i'm a very slow writer i'm a slow writer i'm a slow typer and um i'm not at all efficient in terms of how i do things i you know it may seem productive that's only because i'm old um it's not because i'm really very productive so um uh the my process of writing is um iterative i've come to like to write in public you know to publish early drafts because i get such good feedback about what people understand and what i don't know or mistakes or new sources i think the one the one primary thing that i try to optimize when i'm writing is clarity it's the clarity on the small scale and then yeah even clarity at the large scale so so that's really the only thing that i'm asking myself is am i being understood is how can i make this clearer um and you know a good turn or phrase of course people like that i'll kind of save those babies but in the end i will kill them if they aren't communicating if they aren't clear and um i don't see myself as a writer who's like really good with words and stuff i see myself as someone and and that clarity that i'm trying to get is actually for my own sake it's like i need to really understand this or see this in order to make it clear to someone else and so i have to most of my time writing is pacing and that pacing is me trying to see it to to to to see it to be able to convey it and so um so for me it really is a kind of thinking on paper have you tried the mcluhan churchill style of just talking it out and seeing what happens you know i i have a couple times and my problem is there's not enough resistance it's it's it's um [Music] i tend to say what i know um i find i find it easier to say something new when i'm writing i don't know why that is maybe i could change that maybe i could learn to force myself harder when i'm speaking like a dictating i don't know um i haven't i've tried a couple times and haven't really been very successful um but um it is very it is very appealing because i am such a slow writer yeah um have you tried it yeah i do it all the time man i do it all the time you dictate most of your stuff i don't dictate most of my stuff but here's what i do you say all the time what do you mean by all the time there was a while where what i would do is i would on my way home whenever i got off the subway when i was live in new york on the way home i would dictate one idea and i would get an auto transcription and then i would keep a fair amount of them and then the other thing that i do all the time so i'm working on a big essay right now about how to save the liberal arts and i just finished the first draft it's about 10 000 words but it's super disjointed so what i'll do is i'll read the entire thing and then i will speak out a summary and i'll give myself like three minutes to do so and when i have to summarize what ends up happening is a something that is sort of amorphous almost like an amoeba all of a sudden gets structured into an idea where there becomes this logical flow and for that i find speaking forces me to structure whereas my words on a page are sort of much more cubist like they're all over the place and they sort of slither and slather in ways that don't make sense that's an interesting idea of of trying to speak a summary because here's here's what i have observed is that the best time to write a book is after you've done the book tour for the because after you've had to summarize it for a year you finally realize what the book is about right it's like i wish i knew that when i was writing the book so um uh so the idea of speaking up the summary might actually be something i should try go for it hey i got a question for you about the long now so i find that the long now is sort of stands in contrast to the biases of screens and the biases of neil postman saw this as the biases of the television which was that it's all about the now we live in this never-ending now where we're sort of completely aware of the news cycle we're completely aware with our moment in history right here right now but we don't get introduced to that many historical ideas at least as a percentage basis if you go to your college library the average book that you find will be written 50 years ago or now the average post on social media was like 24 to 72 hours and so what you're doing is i don't think that people really realize that this is one of sort of the implicit or explicit messages of the long now is that in our perception of time we can actually stretch it like an accordion and then have like a long now clock that operates over what a thousand ten thousand years where we're then thinking from generations past to generations future rather than from the beginning of the week to the end of it absolutely you're absolutely right and another way to maybe convey what the long now perspective is about is that we want to learn to become good ancestors just as we have benefited from the work of our ancestors making building roads building buildings that have lasted for generations we want to be good's ancestors ourselves so that people in the future might look back and say thank you right for doing that so how do we become good ancestors when things are moving so fast and how do we um make something where most of the benefits may not come out but down the road two generations from now right so that's that's the benefit of like science investing into pure science and research is that those are not going to pay off next year maybe even five years but they will pay off in 10 or 15 years and maybe we should be investing in things that don't pay off for 100 years how can we become good ancestors and invest into things that will not pay off during our lifetime but in the future and so some people talked about colonizing the future that we kind of like were kind of like imperial we were kind of robbing we're kind of like robbing the future generations of their value by using it up now right and so so this is a kind of a form you know colonialism and imperialism and that we actually want to kind of decolonize and allow more of today's value to go and increase and the other the other metaphor is a lot of silicon valley folks entrepreneurs are really good at scaling up things in time right um now figure out how to do something and scale it up in volume scale up in size but we're much more interested in scaling up things over time so that they start small now they become bigger and bigger and bigger as they go along and that most again the most of the benefits happen in the future so that scaling up in time is a skill that we don't really have and we want to kind of promote and maintenance and then there's maintenance right so how do you maintain things so that again this is so you're maintaining as a good ancestor into the future so um uh that the long now of course is contrary to the short now which was the last five minutes the next five minutes we want to think about the last 10 000 years in the next 10 000 years most of the futurists that i know they're any good are very good historians you want to take the long view and we are trying to think not again we're not trying to make a plan we're not trying to predict the future we're not like osmos foundation which has some kind of thousand-year plan no we're saying we want to um liberate the long-term imagination to go to your point you want to have people imagine over large time scales imagine what you could do now that might take a long time to succeed or come to fruition to imagine what we would be like if we kept future generations in mind when we made things yeah that's a beautiful way to close kevin kelly thank you very much thank you it's a real delight i loved having our conversation um i really appreciate um you're taking the time to talk to me sure thing
