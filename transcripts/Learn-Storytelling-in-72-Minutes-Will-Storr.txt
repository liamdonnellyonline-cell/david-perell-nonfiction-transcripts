Will store is on the show today and he's written seven books and he is like a scientist for storytelling. And now you might think, "Oh my goodness, do we need another storytelling person?" But Will's different. And he's different because he talks about character instead of plot. Most people talk about the hero's journey, but Will says, you know, let's talk about great characters. What makes for a good character? And what's fun about this episode is by the time you're done, you're going to be able to go out, hang out with your friends, and instantly test what he's talking about. All right, let's rock. So, what I want to start off by talking about is stories and why we have stories to make sense of reality. Well, one of the main reasons we process reality as a story is just simplicity to kind of, you know, reality is enormously complex. It's chaotic. And what's one of the things that story does is is give us this kind of simple kind of fairly linear kind of experience of the world. So kind of that simplification is really really important. It's also really important for um kind of human behavior and human progress like we're a unique animal in the sense that we imagine the future. We have these great dreams and ambitions and goals. Um we have regrets you know that exist in stories from our past. And so that kind of storytelling capacity um you know is really our superpower in the sense of it it really you know separates us from the rest of the animals. I mean, you know, cows and, you know, fleas and fish aren't imagining the future like what if we could, you know, escape the ocean and get on land, but humans do that. So, so that's the other thing our storytelling capacities are doing. They're kind of um, you know, really helping us um, survive and progress. And what is it that most people miss about storytelling? Because what I want to do with this with this interview is take what most people miss and show people what they can do to write better stories, to tell better stories. I mean there's a few things really. I mean one of the things that I've written about a lot in the past is about um character. I I think um in the past well ever since Aristotle really you know 2000 plus years ago people have been trying to figure out the secrets of story and the only way you really up until recently you could do that is by getting all the stories that work and comparing them and seeing what works and then say well all these stories that work you know this happens and then this happens and then this happens and then so what you end up with is this kind of recipe this kind of plot recipe and so people have these various ideas about this is the, you know, there's the there's the hero's journey, the Jersey camera recipe, there's the um save the cat recipe, there's John York's into the woods recipe, you know, this is recipes a and so that that that makes people think about plot a lot. You know, I'm going to if I if I have these kind of events in this in this order, I'm going to get a bestseller. I'm going to get a um you know, blockbusting movie. Um but what that misses is character. And and I and I argue that character is actually much more you can't really they're both really essential but character is much more important than plot and I think it's character that makes amazing stories you know really amazing. Our most memorable stories stories that mean the most to us are the ones with the most memorable characters. Well let's dive in. So what makes for a good character? So the way I um think about character and the way I teach designing character in my workshops um is to begin with a very very simple idea um of what your kind of character stands for. So you can think about the brain as this machine for controlling the world. That's what we're all trying to do. I mean that's what every living thing is trying to do trying to control the world in order to get what they want. um um and and so every human has this kind of set of ideas um that kind of dictates their behavior such that they kind of get what they want. So, if you would take say take say take say take say take say take say take say take say take say take say take say take Donald Trump and um I don't know Gandalf the wizard and and put them in a room and they've both got to get what they want out of the world you know Donald Donald Trump is going to he's going to approach a problem in a very different way to Gandalf the wizard or you know Peppa Pig or you know whatever so that's how I think about character a character is this kind of theory of control but how do I control the world and the way to start off is is with a really really simple idea about about how do I control the world like a one ideally a one-s sentence idea. This is my theory of how the world works. And what would examples of that be? Would it be like I need the power? I need to be the coolest. Help me think about how to how to do that. Well, it's usually a a kind of, you know, I talk about these kind of various sentences you can complete and one of them is I am only safe if I So, if you think about um Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, I'm only safe if I have keep all the money and love to myself. That's that's his theory of control. you know, he's this vulnerable, flawed character at the beginning, uh, that for whatever reason has come to believe that that that he he needs the only way he can protect himself and keep himself safe is by making sure he's got all the money. And and so that's Scrooge. That's who he is. A a and from that very simple idea of character comes actually a character of huge complexity, um, uh, of huge kind of profoundity. Um, and it's a really elegant story. Of course, the three ghosts come along. They show him these are the ramifications of your theory of control. This is the this is the damage it's causing your life and he learns and he changes. And then by the end of the story, he's he's the opposite. He's very generous. And so he gets the the the rewards of the hero gets love. He gets status. So that would be a kind of a classic example of of a theory of control. Um Willie Lman in the death of a salesman is something about um success is all that matters. You know, success in the world. that's all that matters. So, so he's he's he's obsessed with the idea of success both for for him and his sons. And that obsession with success, success, success. Um I think Arthur Miller himself says something about um you know, Willow's idea was that was that when you die, God weighs you on the scale and weighs your success and you either pass and you either fail. It's kind of that idea. And again, death of a salesman is this very interesting examination of the damage that that idea has caused um you know him and his life. So so that's that's another example. I don't know whether he had um we had a big big big hit um seriously called Flea Bag, a sitcom written by Phoebe Wbridge um was massive over here and and and that was a young sort of millennial woman who basically the only value she saw in herself was was sexual. So she was sex I'm a sexual being and that's my only value. And you know again Flea Bag was this very funny. It was a sitcom but it was also quite profound and quite interesting and quite deep and it and it was profound and interesting and deep because she had a really interesting character with a really specific theory of control about the world that she controls the world with her sexuality and again you know the story shows the drama and the craziness and the damage that that idea had caused for her life and the life of the people around her. So that question is I only feel safe when yeah that's one of them you know there there are all kinds I mean you know another famous one would be um when Harry Met Sally um Harry's theory of theory that was tested in that in that in that um screenplay was very famously men and women can't really be friends because sex always gets in the way. That's his idea and and and that entire movie um and those brilliant characters were were a test of that idea. You know he stood for that idea. That's who he was. So I think that's where you begin with a character, a very simple idea about the world which the character stands for and the character tests and that's how you get um profoundity in a story. That's how your story becomes not a series of plot points of everinccreasing drama. It becomes um a real profound examination of how the human world works. Because is it true that men and women can't really be friends? Sex always gets in the way. That's a really interesting question and and it's fascinating and and there are loads of you know you know there are loads of different for us and against that idea and the screenplay examines those things. So it's interesting, it's got depth, it's fascinating, you know. So, so, so, so I think that's the stuff that people miss when they they just look at the surface drama, ever escalating action, you know, it's not enough. So when novelists or when you're designing a character or somebody's writing a TV show, is this something that they're usually doing in advance or is this something that is sort of an emergent thing that later on they begin to codify? I think it needs to be in advance. I I really do. I mean, because that's where you begin. I think you should begin with character. Um, and you know, you need to have a sense of where the plot's going, but the plot the plot can't exist without you understanding the character. I mean, that's what I find when I'm doing the workshops. I sometimes ask people, tell me about your story, and they come up with all these plot points and then ask, "Tell me a character." And they and they don't really have much of an idea. Oh, they're just this nice person who's struggling a bit. And it's like, if you don't understand your character, how do you know what's going to happen? Because in story, just as in life, what we do, how we respond to the world is a product of our character, is a product of our theory of control. It's a product of who we are. And so, you can't really build a plot in in any way that's going to be realistic and feel authentic and feel interesting and original without first understanding your character. I mean it's if you're writing if you're Phoebe Wage writing Flea Bag all that whole six part two series of it um show comes out of that central idea of you know my I the only value I have to offer other people is my my my my body in a sexual way. There is no story without that. Everything emerges out of that. And that's why it's really interesting piece of work. Or if you have this great what if, you know, like a what if idea like like I want to write a a show about, I don't know, you know, set in a dystopian world of overpopulation, for example. Okay, that's fine. Um, so but then you need to think about, okay, so so who is this story going to be about? What is the perfect person to center a a story about overpopulation on? Or maybe it's somebody who hates human company, like the the ultimate missanthrop, you know, that that would be really interesting. So okay so so okay so you want the ultimate anthther what's their theory of control I'm only safe if I don't know but is around me and then so that's how you you go back what I think is important here that I want to emphasize is that whatever their theory of control is the flaw in the theory has to be revealed over time that there is some fundamental flaw that they think that the world looks looks like this they have some model of reality and then they go D. They're going about their life, everything seems good, and then all of a sudden there becomes a disconnect between the story in their head of how they can be successful and what's actually true about the world and now all of a sudden those two things clash and then that's when the conflict begins. That's when your story begins. Yeah. Exactly. So when we talk about the theory of control, it's a yeah, as you say, it's a flawed theory of control. You know, of course in Flea Bag her only value isn't her sexuality. That's that's not true. You know, that's not true of anybody. You know, all stories change. It's a series of causy link changes, but but one of the most important things that's changing throughout your story is your character, right? And so, so, so, so the story really begins when they realize, you know, like in the Godfather classic example, the theory of control of of the Apuccino character, whatever his name was, was I'm not a gangster. I am um going to be a senator. I'm a good man. And of course, the story begins when when there's an attempt on on his father's life, and he gets sucked into that gangster gangster world. So his theory of control, I'm going to survive by not being a gangster. That's that's the that's that's his flawed idea. And it's not flawed in a moral sense. It's flawed in the sense that it's wrong. You know, that's the important thing says about the word flaw. Um and and and and the the story shows why he's wrong because when he's when there's an attempt on the life of his father, he gets sucked in and he wants revenge and all those feelings come up. So So that's what we're doing. Um as the story is going through, we are kind of breaking apart that theory of control. And then if the if the if if the story has a happy ending, it's in the final scene, literally in the final beat of the movie or the story or very often you see the characters change. The floor is fixed. They're not that broken person anymore. They've they've they they fixed that mistake that they're making about themselves or the world. Yeah. And how much of this is about us asking, well, how should I live? How should I be? What's the flaw going on in my head? How much of this is our ability to basically get into the life of a character versus be like, "Oh my goodness, well, I'm trying to examine my own life and look in the mirror and and what's going on for me?" Like, how much of this is just we're just narcissists and we're thinking about what's happening in our brains. Well, actually I I I don't I mean I I I I have no doubt that when people, you know, artists I mean to to a great extent are very often trying to figure out their own problems like this is how I see the world and why is it wrong and trying to like you know that that that's what artists are doing often in any medium. They're they're exploring their own damage in in that way. But but but I've also I've got no no doubt that that once you understand these principles, you could write a story about somebody that has a flaw that's nothing like yours. Like if you're a Hollywood screenwriter, you you just got to write the write the damn movie. Or if you're if you're writing, you know, for HBO, you've just got to sit in a writer's room and and write um the next Mad Men or Sopranos or whatever whatever it's going to be. That's what I think is interesting about these principles. You don't have to it doesn't actually have to come from personal experience. You just have to be able to imagine what what is life like for somebody who only cares about success and that's the only thing that they ever think about, you know? Well, that's that's Willie Lman, you know. So, and and I think if if you're a good writer, I think most people can can can imagine their way into kind of thinking through that th those sort of somehow alien lenses. And what makes what you're saying, people might think, oh my goodness, well, I'm just going to have a caricature and this person is not actually going to have the depth that an actually good character has. But you just seem to completely reject that. So, what is the thing that people miss? This comes up all the time because people think, well, if I I you know, you're reducing my character to one sentence. How unbelievably like what um and um and it's just it's bit it is paradoxical, but I promise you that that's how you get the most complex and interesting um characters. And so in the science of storytelling, the book I've written about all this, I I I I go in detail at the book The Remains of the Day by Kazu Ishiguru, you know, hugely respected literary author. No one's going to accuse Ishiguru of being simplistic, but but um you know his central character does this exactly and that's Stevens the butler um who um just completely believes in in the the supremacy the natural supremacy of the English who are in the right environment for this you know so he so he really believes that the English are you know um make the best butlers and the English aris they shouldn't really be democracy English aristocrats should make all the decisions like he completely um uh you know and his theory of control is English reserve I is how a person should operate and and that that's how you should be and so so so that's who he is um and you know we were talking just a minute ago about how the story begins when something happens that challenges that that that that theory of control and so he's very deliberately set his story not in 1890 the height of the of British power and the British Empire but in 1950 um when British power was beginning to decline and the the big stately home that he's worked in has been sold by his English aristocrat and bought by an American, God forbid. So those guys Yeah. Yeah. So so this is a bit this is a bit of a shock. Um so English power is declining. His new boss is an American, a guy from, you know, symbolically a person from the new world. Um and that his new American boss is he's got to cut down the the staff running the house. And so what happens is um the only person that he knows that he could who could successfully run the house on this reduced staff is this woman um that that you basically learn that he's kind of in love with who doesn't work there anymore. And so the American boss sends him out, borrow my car and go out and drive down to Cornwall and just ask her to come back and work for her. So he goes on this road trip out into the real world and meets real people. Um, and the whole novel really is is him go is is him reassessing this this notion he's got of the superiority of the English upper classes. That's that's what it is. And and it's a novel of incredible depth and power. You know, it's just fascinating about all the flaws of that sense of English British superiority that there certainly was, you know, back in the day. A lot less of that now. Um, and that begins with this extremely simple idea for these guys. And so it's it's just not true that you end up with a simplistic character because what you're doing is you're if you're writing your story properly is you're taking this idea about the world and you're testing it in a million different ways and seeing how that person reacts and and and so so as I say, you end up with this very deep rich experience and also you know just think about some of the characters that we you know that we that we know and love from literature. I mean so you know another one again is is Scrooge. I mean, nobody calls Scrooge a simplistic character, right? But but but he is there as a kind of test of this very interesting idea about greed and selfishness. You know, greed and selfishness are not simplistic themes. They're complex, deep, profound themes. And so that that that's kind of what you're doing. So so so yeah, people do resist because they think it's reductive. But but but but it's like an atomic bomb. It's it begins as this tiny thing and it kind of explodes in meaning. Yeah. Yeah, the one parallel that comes to mind is in public speaking that a lot of people think, oh, if I just reduce it down to three points or one point, oh, it's going to be too simplistic. But the fact of the matter is that really ties together your entire piece and it also actually allows people to remember. Yeah. And allows people to get a sense for what's going on. But what I want to do now is I want to shift into the turning point inside of a story. Yeah. And when there's thing A that becomes thing B because you have this line from uh the screenwriter John York who said the image every TV character in fact or fiction always looks for is the closeup of the human face as it registers change. Yeah. Yeah. So all story is is an account of change and and I think that the well-written story is is just this symphony of change is things changing constantly on every level. So you've got the change on the surface level of the drama. Stuff's happening. Stevens is going out into the world and this road trip and he's meeting these people. He's meeting his car's breaking down and this is happening and that's happening. You've got change on the subconscious level of the character as as the drama is changing. Their theory of control is changing. Their idea about how the world work is changing. So that's very dramatic and tense and and and and I think that's the secret kind of kind of energy that really powers through stories. when you see the character changing, you kind of, you know, you become gripped. Um, and of course there's, you know, loads of other things change. The character's goal can change, the characters understanding of who the, you know, the cast of characters around them can change. Their um, you know, really great storytelling is just is just full of full of change. And that that that's what's um, keeping people gripped and and and that change has to be, you know, causal, you know, ideally. So one change is triggering the next, triggering the next, triggering the next. It isn't that this thing happens and then this thing happens and then this thing happens. It's, you know, you've got to have this kind of like um domino effect. Um where where one change is triggering the next, triggering the next. And that's that's how a good story is structured in that kind of engineering sense. Who do you think does this well? I think all successful storytellers have got have got that kind of um instinct. I mean, I've been watching I've been watching the Sopranos again recently. The series series three, four, and five of Sopranos. I had CO a couple weeks ago, so I was in bed watching this. Oh, man. Um, and and and they and David Chase and his team did that really well. I mean, everything's causal. So, so one thing triggers the next, which triggers the next, which triggers the next, which triggers the next. So, you're just gripped. You can't you can't stop watching. And and that causal understanding of the world, that that's very human. That's how the storytelling brain understands the world as well. So humans um we see causes and effects where there are no um causes and effects. So if you put a human in front of a screen with a bunch of randomly moving dots, the human will start telling a story about what's happening with those dots. So this this dot is chasing this one and he's hiding and all that kind of stuff. And it's completely random, but but we are, you know, we see causes and effects everywhere. And that's actually how a healthy human brain works. And when humans go mad, when they go crazy, that that storytelling capacity tightens up and and it becomes overactive. So people with psychosis and who people who are paranoid see causes and effects where there are no causes and effects. They start going, you know, going back chemtrails and 5G masks and COVID and they'll start connecting things which shouldn't be connected, right? Um but but to them it feels completely real, you know? So, so, so, so, so yeah, that that causality is um um is a fundamental part of the way that humans think and and and and that's why great storytelling should be causal because causality is the language of the human brain. And when when when storytellers don't do causal like when they're David Lynch being David Lynch and this all these sort of weird disconnected events, people call it hard work. It's quite hard work. It's quite difficult. Yeah. And they call it hard work and difficult because it's not causal. So we're having to like consciously think about how does that thing connect with that thing? And it's like a puzzle that you're trying to solve that is is is actually impossible to solve, you know, often. Yeah. Yeah. So as you're writing a story, how do you think about doing your outline? Like what are the different components of an outline? Well, I've got like a five my own five act plan, you know, which is in based, you know, inspired by Frightex Pyramid. Um uh but but but it but it it works with that theory of control idea. So I I think the problem for me with existing plot plans structures is that they don't really take into account character change. And I think it's character change that should um power a story. So just those five those five acts of a of a commercial story, you know, um not a literary one, but like a Hollywood blockbuster or a bestselling um novel would be act one. This is me and it's not working. So this is me. So you see the theory of control, you meet the person sometimes quite slow at the beginning of the story because because you you you're being introduced to the person and their and their theory of child and why it's flawed, right? So you see you see the person, you see them behave and you see how their behavior isn't working anymore. So if you're Stevens, you see, oh, he believes in English supremacy, but this is the 50s and everything's going to [ __ ] in England, right? So so, so this is me and it's not working. Act two is is there another way? So that so so something happens which makes them makes them realize this is this me that I've been for all my life is not working anymore and then you've got the ignition point or the exciting incident sometimes it's called um which sets them on their way and it forces them to begin changing and they begin experimenting with a kind of a new form of self and then you've got act three which contains the midpoint the big turning point which is there is I have transformed so often um in in in the very middle of the story um the character embraces this new theory of control. So if you watch Jaws, exactly in the middle of Jaws, Jaws is about a man who's, you know, people think Jaws is about a shark. It's not about a shark. It's about a man who's scared of the ocean. It's about a man who's scared of the water. Um so the central character of that his responsibility is for the safety of the residents of I think it's called Amit Island on the east coast of um the US and the shark comes along and he can't protect his people anymore. Um and and it's made much worse because he's terrified of the ocean. you know, he's he's got reputation of being scared of water and people laugh at him about this. In fact, his wife says he's so scared when he gets the ferry over um the car ferry over that he stays in the car, won't get out of the car, and the car is so scared of the water. And so so so the shark comes and and um to help him with his fear of the water, you get this new character which is quite, you know, an archetypal character like a Yoda character, Dumbledore, a teacher helper character who teaches him about the ways of the ocean, the sharks. And then at the very middle of Jaws, um he goes in the ocean. He goes, "Fuck it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to go out there and I'm going to fight the shark." So that's what you get. Um you know, this transformation of character. I'm only safe if I stay away from the water. I'm going to go in the water, right? And then the next act, act four, is but can I face the pain of change? So the thing about a theory of control is it's protective, you know. So so that those ideas around which we orient our lives somehow protect us. They they they give us um some kind of safety, some kind of sense of um identity. And when we when we when we reject those ideas, there's a there's a cost to that thing. So you know, an obvious example be the godfather. At the very beginning of middle of Godfather, um Apple's character kills kills a police chief and a rival gangster. His theory of control is I'm only safe if I never be a gangster. Now he's transformed. He kills people. So now he is a gangster. Going back from that and act four is but can I take the pain that the pain of change. So I've transformed and now the ramifications come in. So it's like a test, right? So it's like the god's testing the character. Can you okay you've made this decision now to become different. Can you [ __ ] handle it? That's what the story's doing. And so in The Godfather, um you know, the police attack, rival gangsters attack, it's just a massive increase in drama in Jaws, um the shark attacks obviously. And then finally, you've got act five um where there's often a final showdown and the character has to decide, is this forever? Is this really me? This change, this new theory of control. And if it's a happy ending, um they have. And so so so what you'll often find when you when you when you look at stories um is the very final scene of a story often isn't the end of the drama, the very final scene is shows the character change. So in Jaws um you you watch Jaws and then and and then there's the final shadow with the shark and he kills the shark. He puts a compressed air tank in the shark's mouth and shoots it. So it blows the shark up. Wonderful. But that's not the people think that's the final scene, but it's not. final scene, he's swimming back to the shore um uh with his oceanographer friend and he says, "I used to be scared of the ocean." And his mate goes, "I can't imagine why." And then the credits roll. And it's the same in The Godfather. People think people remember the Godfather the end of it being that that you know the the thing where he's killing he's getting all of his enemies killed and it's this massive blood bath but the final scene is actually him uh in a room a bit like this surrounded by other gangsters who are all kissing his ring and calling him Godfather and then the credits roll. So so so the final scene is the is the character transformation. It's not the kind of the the the drama. Let's go back through them. So the first one is here's the character. This is me and it's not working. This is me and it's not working. Number two is, hey, there actually might be another option. We can go see this. Yeah. Okay. So, then we keep going. And then there's the character change. Yeah. They embrace the change. I'm going to do it. I'm going to change. Yeah. Okay. Number four is they've are they going to embrace the change. Yeah. So, it's a test. Can you can you take the pain of change? So, okay, you've changed, but now the ramifications of that change come in or the you know, so so there's a huge escalation in drama. And then say the final act is um is I have transformed or or I haven't transformed. You haven't. So in a tragedy it works a bit differently because in a tragedy you've got somebody who's flawed and rather than changing they just double down on the floor. Yeah. Yeah. So so and then what you have is end of a tragedy is they they usually end up dead but at the very least ostracized in the community or in prison or something like this. So in tragedy they don't embrace the character change. Right. That's why we call it a tragedy. Yeah. Exactly. That's why we call it a tragedy. Yeah. Um, what do you make of the hero's journey and what it reveals about the structure of consciousness? Well, I mean, you know, I I I want to give full respect to Joseph Campbell and the hero's journey, but I do feel like it's it's, you know, it's he came up with that in the 1940s. It's getting on. It's like 80 years old now, and I feel like it's time we move kind of beyond that. Like in I think in it full its full length, the hero's journey is this 22b kind of plot thing. And of course it's, you know, it's probably the most influential story theory of all time. Massively successful and and it's been responsible for some incredible, you know, examples of storytelling, but also a lot of junk, you know. So, you know, my feeling is it it it's time for us to salute it but retire it really because I think, you know, we know so much more about storytelling now because of the advances we've made in psychology, especially evolutionary psychology, in neuroscience. The one word that hasn't come up is a sense of suspense. Like when I think of the great stories of when I've been, you know, just sitting on my chair just watching a movie or something, you're like, "Oh my goodness, what is going to happen?" Like, I need to keep reading and what is going on with how context is set up, where the mystery comes from, where that sense of, oh my goodness, I need to figure out what is going to happen. Where does that come from? Yeah. Well, I think well, I mean, I I think um that's part of the craft of the storyteller to come up with, you know, stuff that's going to happen in the plot that's going to really, you know, test the character, surprising events. Um, you know, I I I think this theory of control that we all have in our heads to direct our behavior, it's kind of who we are. It's our identity. It's our it's our very sense of self. I mean, you know, it's very hard to change that. And so in story and in real life, if somebody's going to change the real the real kind of core of who they are, that takes something really dramatic to happen. You know, so so so that's where I think the suspense comes in really good really well stories. Uh is is um you know, what's the perfect thing that could happen to to this particular person? So, you know, we were sort of talking before about maybe you could write a story like well, who's the perfect person um to tell a story about which will be about overpopulation, about some dystopian future where there's too many people. Well, it's the the ultimate loner like like so so creating the perfect person for the perfect character for your kind of what if that automat should automatically be creating suspense because you've got these two elements which are um um kind of in conflict like with Stevens in Remains of the Day. He believes in he believes in the superior the natural superiority of the English. Um so you drop him in 1950 with an American boss, right? That automatically creates suspense, creates drama. What I'm sensing is both of those have the sense of conflict where you have what this person wants, what they're going for, their sort of idyllic state. Yeah. And then we now have a conflict between those two things. And what I'm seeing though is one sense of conflict is they want this thing. They're now in a place where they don't get that thing. So that's like the British aristocrat butler guy. Yeah. In America or sort of with American boss. Okay. Now we have conflict there. I think another one is exactly the opposite of that which is you want this thing. Fine. I'll give you that thing. I'm going to give you that thing in its extreme. You're now going to be taken to the limit of that thing and you're going to scratch your head and you're and you're going to say, "Uh, okay. Hold on. Actually, I don't really like this that much." like Brewster's Millions, right? Do you ever see that film Bruce Millions? Maybe Bruce Millions. I'm think it was Richard Prior and I think I think he you know he was somebody that was like he was like a working-class African-American guy and he there was something about some relative had given him he he could inherit his millions but he had to spend a ridiculous amount of money in a 24-hour period and he wasn't and he wasn't allowed to give it away. So, so, so it's brilliant because because he's got everything he wanted, but but he but by by being given everything he wanted, he learns, you know, he learns that it's not that important at the end of the day. So, it's a very Yeah, it's a really smart way of Exactly. kind of achieving the same thing and testing the character. You're still testing that theory of control. You're testing the idea around which that character orients their lives, right? Because the thing that you've always wanted turns out to be uh more hollow than you thought. Yeah. Yeah. And I was talking to somebody about Madmen the other day. you know, Mad Men apparently came out. I I I don't I was told by by this person I was talking to, Matthew Weiner, who used to work on the Sopranos um writing team, had this kind of insight suddenly that he had everything he'd ever wanted. He's working on this amazing hit show, was a TV writer, but he still wasn't happy. So, so he wanted to to tell a story about people who had everything they wanted, but they still weren't happy. And that was Don Draper with his perfect wife, his amazing job, his perfect looks. And, you know, I think about White Lotus as well. I mean, White Lotus is brilliant because it's it's very it's character-driven. Um um um and you've got all these people who have everything they could possibly want, but they're still not happy. So, so, so again, that for me that gives these stories this rich profoundity because it's about character um rather than being about plot plot. Hitchcock has a line where he says there's no terror in the bang only in the anticipation of it. Yeah. And uh what's going on with that? Well, yeah. I think that he's talking there about um well, I mean, what what I talk about uh in the styles of storytelling is is the idea that there's um you know, storytellers play with change, moments of change, but also they play with the threat of change. Yes. You know, so so again going back to Jaws, if you read the book of you know, the novel of Jaws, which is another Yeah. Like it begins with just by describing this this this this big fish swimming through the through the water. So, so it's so so, so it's already sort of playing with with this kind of threat of change. And that's another way of saying suspense, the threat, the threat of change. It's like very often with these ideas, story is like life and it's, you know, it's the same stuff. It's made out of the same stuff. So, so absolutely. Um, the threat of change is this is this amazing weapon that storytellers can use to get people grips to their narrative. Yeah. It's funny because if you just watched a horror movie Yeah. and all you saw was the scary moment. It wouldn't really be much of a scary movie. What you need to see is all the leadup and the music and the dark the dark little shack in the middle of the night and then you get in and it's like what's going to happen? Uh-oh. Uh-oh. And I like that turn of phrase, the threat of change. Yeah. Uh-oh. Something could happen. And that's actually where a lot of the mystery and a lot of the suspense comes from. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the Blair Witch Project, which is like one of the most terrifying fil movies I've ever seen. I mean, the the ending scene is just you're in a dark room and there's a kind of a kind of a ghostly girl standing in the corner like that, which if you if you did if you'd have just were shown that, you'd be like, "What's that?" But because everything leads up to it, it's absolutely horrendously terrifying, you know? So, they they do a brilliant job in the Blair Witch Project of playing with the threat of change in order to freak everybody out. Tell me about this survival, connection, and status. Yeah. and how they relate to stories. Well, the these are kind of really fundamental concepts um um in human life. So, like all animals and indeed plants, humans want to survive. So, we want and and that means we want food, shelter, safety, but also procreation, survival for our kin, our friends, our tribe. So, that's one thing that we want. Um but h humans are kind of social animals. We're tribal. So, so humans are apes that are a bit like ants and we solve the problems of our existence by um coming into groups that are highly cooperative and that's how we've taken over the world. So, if you think about human life, we think about big heroes like Steve Jobs and you know, whoever, but but it's not really individuals that do stuff. It's groups. It's Apple computers and the amazing teams that he led that invented that iPhone and the Mac, you know. So, so, so, so, so we solve all of our problems by connecting into groups. And, and in order to make that work, evolution has to program us with with very powerful drives and instincts. And those drives and instincts are firstly, we seek to connect. So, all humans fundamentally want to connect with other humans. We want to connect with romantic partners in order to enter a cooperative relationship to raise children. We want to um enter into friendship groups to help us you know emotionally to help us when we're sick and in need and it wants to form us into groups um which are you know back in the day were our tribes but today are our political organizations or our the companies that we work for or the soccer teams that we play in. So so so all humans are desperate to connect and the corer of that is that we dread disconnection. So ostracization social rejection is a universal human fear. Yeah. Once we're in those groups, it's not just enough for us to be in a group and accepted in a group. We've got to be valuable to that group. So evolution has programmed us to want status. So that is status is the idea that we are valuable to other people. Um so so that that motivates us to you know back in the days of the huntergatherer tribe to be the best hunter to be the best storyteller to be the best sorcerer or the finder of honey or builder of camp or whatever it might be. So survival, connection and status are the three things that all humans want. There are three fundamental drives and survival, connection and status are also the subject of all human stories. So if you think about um movies like The Revenant or Alien, they're about survival. If you think about movies like Stand by Me or Broke That Mountain, they're about connection. If you think about movies like Whiplash or Barbie, they're movies about status. If you think about the best stories, the stories that we feel that we can watch again and again and again and again and that stand the test of time, they're about all three of those things. So Romeo and Juliet, the Godfather, Star Wars, they're about survival and connection and status in about equal proportion. So those three concepts are fundamental to human life and they're fundamental to human storytelling because humans use stories to teach them how to live. So, of course, that's that's going to be the subject. Human stories. Human stories teach us how to get survival. They teach us how to get connection. Then, it teaches us how to get status and avoid losing those things. So, how do you think about these things as you're just going about your life and you're at the pub with your friends and you know, you're having a pint or something. You're telling a story like how do these ideas show up in terms of your very practical reality? Practical reality. I I think they're really important for mental well-being, psychological well-being. I mean, they've changed the way that I see myself um and my life and deal with my problems because when I when when I'm anxious or depressed, I think, okay, so what's the problem? Is it survival? Is it connection? Or is it status? I love that. And it's always one of those things. Wow. Always one of those things. You know, with status, you got to understand it in the broadest sense. It's like, is it something in my career? Have I had some rejections? Have I had a [ __ ] comment on Amazon or whatever? You know, what it might be. But status is also, is my political team doing badly? Have I read something on on social media that attacks my my team and makes me, you know, so so that's a status thing, too. And so what I find in my personal life is that if I'm having a normal bad day, I've got I've got a problem in one of those things. Maybe I'm feeling sick. That's a survival thing. Maybe I've had an argument with my wife. That's a connection thing. But if I'm starting to get really depressed, there's a problem in two of those buckets. Wow. Or or more. So, it's really changed the way that I I understand my own mental health because it's it's it's 100% correct all of the time that when you're feeling [ __ ] you've got a problem in in in one of those buckets probably. And if you're feeling really bad, probably more than one of those buckets, like the really bad times, maybe you're physically sick, maybe you've you're feeling lonely and disconnected, and maybe your career is going badly. I mean, that's, you know, that that's a recipe for for really significant psychological problems because it's hitting all three of those sort of measures of well-being the brain has. I want to talk about the pacing of stories cuz one of the things that I've picked up from you is that basically if you talk to people, like if you ever meet someone who was in an accident, what do they always say? Well, the car started flipping and it was like time slowed down. Yeah. and I saw this and I saw this and I saw this and I saw this and they'll tell the story and there'll be a little bit of information for the entire day leading up. Then there'll be a lot of information like the four or five seconds and they'll often just remember it so vividly and then there'll be a little bit of information after. All this is to say that our the way that we process reality is during these peak suspenseful moments, the information density of what we remember goes way up. Yeah. And I think the same thing happens when people are telling stories that that's one of the ways that you communicate that this is an important moment is you put in a higher density of information and time seems to slow down. Yeah, I like that information density. That's a lovely way of putting it. That's exactly right. So, you know, so when we're in a car accident, we we we we, you know, the brain speeds up. We we process a lot of information and time seems to slow down to give us more of a chance to react and kind of get ourselves out of that situation. And that's how it should be in storytelling, too, you know. Um the slow bits of life should be told fast and the fast bits of life should be told slow. That's that's the general rule in in in how to make great stories. And I you know, I find this too when I'm because I I'm a ghost writer, too. So, I write I write books for other people. And what I'm always doing when I'm working with clients writing their story, their life stories is saying, "Let's make it a moment. Let's make it a moment." So I'm I'm looking for scenes in their life when they have had some kind of change or when they have learned something and you need to and and I'm always saying, well, we need to make that a moment. And what that what what I mean by that is by by making it a scene. So, I want to know all the information in extreme detail, specific what you were wearing, what was the weather like, what did you have for breakfast, you know? So, so, so, so, so, so it's the same thing. You're kind of slowing that. You're figuring out what are these moments of change that are really important in the story. You're always looking for moments of change. And when you've got an important moment of change, you kind of slow it down um and and you know, make it this sort of dramatic, very detailed moment in the story. And it signals to the to the to the reader obviously this is this is important. And if it, you know, if it is a moment of change where they've learned something important or something has happened that's changed their life in some way, then you have to, that is a moment that should be in the story. And now when you're writing your books, how much of it is you're thinking at the beginning of, hey, we're going to make a map of where things are going to go. This what the book is all about. And how much of it is sort of I'm going to write and kind of see what emerges and then I'm going to maybe do a reverse outline after I have a first draft. I'm going to look at that, outline it. So how much of it is sort of this orderly planning versus sort of spontaneity? I'm a very very much ordinary like a planning person. I come from a my family's engineers. So yeah, I'm very much a planning person. like I like I I want to know how it all works in my head quite in quite some detail before I get going because I want to know how the character changes and I want to know where the big the big moments are and I want to know what the midpoint is and yeah like like I I don't understand like I know that a lot of writers like to just start with a blank page and see where their imag imagination takes them but that's just for me an invitation to to sort of chaos because you you you are almost certainly going to have to be rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and throwing away loads of stuff that doesn't fit like so so I get that some people more naturally work like that but it the idea just gives me the gives me the shivers the he [ __ ] hell yeah I mean I actually did a I did I went on a on a on a writing course last year arvon is a very prestigious got a literary writing course because I was just interested to to hear what very literary storytellers had to say about writing and one of them whose name I won't mention was writing their second novel had a very celebrated first novel, lots of awards, and she was just just kept talking about how agonizing that she was finding the process of writing her second novel, and you could see it was tearing her to bits and and and these were the kinds of people that would look at what we're talking about, plot structures and plans, and thinking, "Oh, oh, no, I just I'm an artist. I'm a creator, right?" And I was just think I didn't say it because it's just, but I just thinking, man, just just read one of these books. It will change your life, you know? Figure out plot. Um, figure out how plots work. um you know so so yeah I I think I I my feeling is a lot of writers because they they're wed to this very silly idea that thinking about plot and craft is low status and artificial uh and that that a true artist only ever starts with a blank page. I think it causes a lot of um heartache for these writers. That's my that's my feeling. Yeah. I think a lot of people think that if they master the basics and really understand technique and what's going on, then it's going to end up diluting their work. And one of the ways that this a very simplistic model of history, you see this a lot in painting that it used to be that people just studied the masters and tried to copy the masters and what you had was a kind of lack of originality. And right now we're in a section of art, an era of art where people reject the masters and they go for high originality. But really what you want is the synthesis of the two. Yeah. Where what you've done is you've studied the masters. You've really looked at them and you've said, "Okay, what are they doing? What is their technique?" And then over time you end up developing your own style. Yeah. And it's just one of the things that has surprised me the most. We look at people like Picasso, people like Monae, and we see, wow, their their their styles are so distinct and different. But if you actually go back and look at their early styles, Picasso and Monae were both painting like hyper realism and it's very strange. And I think that this gets at exactly what you're saying when it comes to stories and actually learning from the masters is people look at the latestage work that people end up making. They say, "Oh my goodness, it's so distinct." While not seeing all the work that came into that, which was just really a form of apprenticeship. Exactly. and and and and I think in every other art form there's an acceptance that you that craft is important. So if you want to be a dancer, if you want to paint, you need to first learn your craft. But in storytelling for some reason in especially for for literary storytellers, they they tend to reject that yeah that that idea for some reason. And and actually the the irony is they're still doing that thing because they they tend to be reading large volumes of other people's work and of course subconsciously they're absorbing those rules anyway. So I think when they write and it does work often you see there there is structure in there um that that is often very similar to structures that that people write about in books like mine or you know the hero's journey or into the woods or say the cat um but they've just absorbed it almost like subconsciously because they've read so much storytelling. Um so so so yeah I think it's I I just think it's a state I think it's I think it's snobbery. I think it's I think I think it's silly and and I and I think a lot of as I say a lot of these writers who are struggling um could would really benefit from from from just having the humility to just learn some craft because you know the the model that I talk about the the five model beginning you know this is me and it's not working it's so broad you know it's such a basic kind of broad structure that you can build almost anything off it I mean and the other thing to say about that five structure is that it's um it's different for literary works so if you want complete character transformation like Jaws or Godfather is the examples that I've used talking about these five acts then use the five acts because um really commercial storytelling you see a full character transformation at the beginning of Jaws um he is terrified of the water at the end of the Jaws he's swimming quite happily through this shark infested ocean giggling about how he used to be scared of the water right um but in literary story that's not what happens it tends to be just act one and two of that of that thing so in literary storytelling you just don't often see that huge character transformation information. So in the in the remains of the day you've got this is me and it's not working you've got is there another way and then um literally in the last I think paragraph or maybe like few few sentences of that novel there's a hint that he might he might change you know I think he even said something like maybe there is another way of seeing the world you know and that's literally storytelling and it's and it's literary because it's more realistic in real life it's very unusual for somebody to go from being phobic of the water to destroying sharks you know it's just not what happens. It's what we want to see, but it's not what happens. So even literary storytellers could could use these structures in in a way that is literary because because you know act one, act two, and a bit of act three, that's that's real life. And so so that's when we're reading in inverted almost high quality literature, that's what it's trying to reflect. It's not giving us this Hollywood um transformational perfect, you know, perfect transformation story. It's just saying this is this is a reflection of what real life is like. How much does what you're saying line up with more ancient kinds of stories, things like the Aztecs or the Incas, like whatever it is, how much how consistent is this throughout history, or is this more like a western thing of the last 2,000 years? That's much more of a kind of a recent um kind of thing really. Um I think a lot of Western storytelling goes back to kind of ancient Greek, you know, myths, as I said before, like the idea of this like powerful hero going out there and yeah, you know, fighting monsters and coming back with boons and all that stuff. is very is a kind of is is a is a very western thing. Um so so so yeah I mean it certainly goes back to the roots of um western European storytelling for sure. I mean you know I think I think the earliest the earliest story we know is Beaolf which is 11. So true. Yeah. And that's basically Jaws as has been documented by Christopher Booker in the seven basic plots. He begins his book by by saying bear wolf is Jaws but a thousand years ago. So so so yeah these these kinds of stories have been around for a very long time and and and and it's say it's because um we you know part of the the evolutionary purpose of story singing is telling us how to survive as a human being and what human beings want is survival connection and status. So stories that tell us how to get survival connection status are naturally interesting to us because we we relate to the person that the story is about um that they are their survival or their connection or their status is imperiled in some way. So we we begin to worry about them and we begin to be be interested in how they're going to fix this problem. It's fundamental to human life and human behavior to be interested in these kinds of these stories because they teach us how to be a human being. And how much of what's happening in stories is a battle between the conscious and the unconscious? Because if you meet someone, so often they'll say, "I want this thing." Yeah. And then you'll ask them, "What's going on?" And then you'll take a step back and they'll actually realize there's all these unconscious desires that have been driving them. Yeah. So I think I think that's a really interesting thing that happens in in lots of storytelling. like um I I think our job as the storyteller is to understand those unconscious unconscious things. Um and what what often happens in storytelling is that that the the character themselves is kind of oblivious to that stuff. Like I mean very often it's very unlikely for a character to to understand explicitly that they want status for example or they want connection. There are lots of sort of times in story where the kind of subconscious reality is revealed to the character and and that can be a very kind of profound and moving Yeah. um moment where they suddenly understand something really important about themselves. um in the Sons of Story Setting. One of my favorite TV series of recent history is um Transparent, which was the show on Amazon Prime that won loads of Emmys and Laughters about um um uh what happened to a family whose father transitioned to a female and um there there's a really brilliant scene um in there where the where the son who's, you know, he's not woke, but he's progressive, you know, he's he's um he's totally up for his father's transition and he's cool and he works in the music industry, but he just starts losing his [ __ ] about nothing in particular and and you can tell he's just breaking down and and he just, you know, breaks down points, you know, nothing's making sense. Nothing's adding up. And you can see, you know, it's really powerful because you can see his conscious story that he's telling himself is, "I'm fine. Everything's fine. I'm happy with my dad." Um, and then and and then there's a very moving scene where where where someone says to him, "Have you mourned the death of your father?" And he says, "Oh, you're not supposed to say stuff like that. He's not dead." and he said, "Yeah, but have you mourned the death of your father?" And he breaks down in tears. I mean, it's really it's really I'm getting choked up talking about it because it's really moving. Um, and it's, you know, really brave of the writers, you know, it was written in a kind of a slightly pre-woke era, so you could actually be a bit more honest about these subjects. And it was really showing that this guy was really consciously trying was convinced his theory of control is I'm just going to be everything's great, everything's fine. But unconsciously, he was broken. And he was broken because in transitioning effectively his father was dead. He didn't have a father anymore. And that was you know and that was causing all this kind of corruption and disruption in his life. So you know that's to me that's amazing storytelling. It's deep. It's rich. It's profound. It's brave. Um uh yes you know it's fantastic. I I think that's something you see a lot in the modern world just in terms of how people go about their lives. Yeah. You know, if you talk to people who have some sort of manic obsessive behavior where what they're doing is they're compensating for something that they didn't have or some sort of loss that they never grieved. And you know, you hear all the time of somebody goes to therapy or whatever it is and they say, "Oh my goodness, for the last 30 years I've been compensating for this thing and I didn't even realize I was doing that." And um I think that that would be another layer that I would if I was designing a character that I would think through is where is there a disconnect between almost like the simplicity of what they say they're going for? Like a lot of times we'll really simplify our motivations. Oh, I just want money, but like actually this thing happened when you were a kid. You were abused by your dad or you grew up really poor and you had a conversation with your dad and you said, "Hey, are we really poor?" And dad says, "No, no, no, son." But then you have this like conflict or whatever and your whole life becomes a compensation for that. But a lot of times that just happens at this very primal intuitive subconscious level. Absolutely. And so I when I'm teaching I call this origin damage. It's like good to figure out when you've got your character in their broken view of the world. Say you're Harry and you believe that men and women can't really be friends because sex always gets in the way. It's good to have an idea of where did he get that idea from. And but the interesting thing is you don't actually have to put that in your story. I look it's enough that you can know and um when I was researching the sons of storytelling I actually read interestingly that Shakespeare was what was was the pioneer of doing this. So it's quite well known that Shakespeare's plays were just based on it was just cut and pasting stuff that was out there already. Yeah. He was just really good at putting it together. Yet another guy who knew the literature well, you know. Yeah. But but but but but but very often in in in the in the stories that that he based his plays on, it would tell you why why Kingley had you know was behaving in this kind of crazy way and why you know what had happened in his background. But but um you know why Hamlet was this you know was behaving in this particular way. But Shakespeare took all that stuff out. Oh wow. And by taking all that stuff out, he he he create like you have this effect of creating characters that are just much more interesting because you start thinking well why are they this way? Um so so so I I I thought that was sort of fascinating this idea that you that you don't have to put that stuff in the story. Um you know another example from from recent be the film Shame about a sex addict but like we never actually find out. Um uh there's a really weird relationship between the Michael FBender character who's the sex addict and his sister and it's almost kind of playing with it slightly in ancestral stuff like a bit like it's a bit weird you never quite work out kind of what it is and it's not actually in the in the play like what happened like why is he a sex addict what's his weirdness with his sister and I've heard that um in the original screenplay that it was in there and and and and the story was that Fastpender's character when he was a kid, he he he heard his sister being sexually abused and he um didn't step in and stop it. And that's what's [ __ ] him up and that's why he's just that's what that's made him deranged. And that the um that was taken out of the that explanation for his character was taken out of the the screenplay which is actually you know brilliant because you you know because you don't need it you know you know when you meet people in real life you don't find out what's this kind of thing that's what's what's their origin damage what's the thing that's created this broken view of the world. So, so, so, so it's interesting and and and it allows the space for the viewer or the reader to step in and come up with your own ideas and your own theories and your own thoughts about Well, a lot of times just the way life works is you see that somebody's got this flaw and then you see that, whoa, that flaw is actually steering their lives quite a bit. And actually, it's only later on that actually becomes part of the suspense of talking to somebody about what's going on, they end up figuring that out later. So that could even be in a story something that gets revealed later on. Yeah. Yeah. Let's move into the world of business and the world of leadership and politics and all that sort of stuff. I mean stories are hugely impactful, right? A politician, they get up, they they they need to have a story of where things were, why things have gone wrong, how they're going to improve things. A business, so much of a business is a story. Amazon, we're going to be the world's most customer- ccentric company. It's always day one is a story. It's always day one. Um, how does it show up there? Well, again, it's fundamental. I mean, you got to go right back to the beginning of human evolution to figure out, you know, why do we become this storytelling animal? And the answer is it's again because we are this highly cooperative ape. You know, we're part ape, part. And so, in order to to get all these individual human brains and wire them up together so they're all thinking in the same way so they can cooperate together, you need a story. And and so you know a story about what is good, what is bad, what do we want, how do we get there, you know what kind of what is a good person, what is a bad person, that kind of story. And so when lots of people are kind of absorb that story into their brains, they all start thinking the same way. And that's how human groups all work. So you know, as as you say, Amazon has a story about the world. Um the Democrats and the Republicans both have competing stories of the world. China has a story about what's going on with tariffs and so does Trump and you know like so so all all groups are bound together by story and you know that that that's kind of that's kind of what story was originally for was for um enabling us to come together in the form of this kind of collaborative super organism that we we all think it think as one you know you see the effect when we go to the cinema go to the movies and and everybody goes in there as individuals and the film comes on and and you know said they're watching trading cases and then suddenly they're not thinking about their own lives. They're they're they're experienced in the life of Vetty Murphy and Dan Akroyd, you know, in Philadelphia in 1983. That's that's what it is for 90 minutes. And the amazing thing is that the whole audience is is having that experience. So, so all those 01:0:0,549 --> 01:0:2,799 01:0:0,559 --> 01:0:4,160 brains are experiencing the same 01:0:2,789 --> 01:0:4,160 01:0:2,799 --> 01:0:5,680 consciousness and you and you know we 01:0:4,150 --> 01:0:5,680 01:0:4,160 --> 01:0:8,079 have that weird experience sometimes 01:0:5,670 --> 01:0:8,079 01:0:5,680 --> 01:0:9,520 when you leave the movie theater and you 01:0:8,069 --> 01:0:9,520 01:0:8,079 --> 01:0:11,359 kind of got this weird sort of almost 01:0:9,510 --> 01:0:11,359 01:0:9,520 --> 01:0:12,480 like drunkenness where you still you 01:0:11,349 --> 01:0:12,480 01:0:11,359 --> 01:0:14,240 kind of think you're the hero of the 01:0:12,470 --> 01:0:14,240 01:0:12,480 --> 01:0:16,079 movie for a few seconds.

And he said, "You know, it's 01:0:50,230 --> 01:0:52,880 01:0:50,240 --> 01:0:55,440 really weird. Sometimes it's better to 01:0:52,870 --> 01:0:55,440 01:0:52,880 --> 01:0:57,440 actually have worse returns, but to have 01:0:55,430 --> 01:0:57,440 01:0:55,440 --> 01:0:59,040 a really clear story for why your 01:0:57,430 --> 01:0:59,040 01:0:57,440 --> 01:1:0,960 returns will stay consistent. So, he's 01:0:59,030 --> 01:1:0,960 01:0:59,040 --> 01:1:2,640 like, if you can make 15% 01:1:0,950 --> 01:1:2,640 01:1:0,960 --> 01:1:4,480 year-over-year, but you have a really 01:1:2,630 --> 01:1:4,480 01:1:2,640 --> 01:1:7,599 clear story as for why that's going to 01:1:4,470 --> 01:1:7,599 01:1:4,480 --> 01:1:9,760 be versus you make 20% year-over-year, 01:1:7,589 --> 01:1:9,760 01:1:7,599 --> 01:1:12,319 but you're sort of just like, I don't 01:1:9,750 --> 01:1:12,319 01:1:9,760 --> 01:1:14,440 really know how we did it and all that, 01:1:12,309 --> 01:1:14,440 01:1:12,319 --> 01:1:17,359 even if you made more 01:1:14,430 --> 01:1:17,359 01:1:14,440 --> 01:1:19,280 money with the 20, the 20 guy makes more 01:1:17,349 --> 01:1:19,280 01:1:17,359 --> 01:1:21,280 money. the more institutional companies, 01:1:19,270 --> 01:1:21,280 01:1:19,280 --> 01:1:23,280 they want to give their money to the 15 01:1:21,270 --> 01:1:23,280 01:1:21,280 --> 01:1:25,359 because they actually have a clearer 01:1:23,270 --> 01:1:25,359 01:1:23,280 --> 01:1:27,760 story about why things are going to 01:1:25,349 --> 01:1:27,760 01:1:25,359 --> 01:1:31,280 continue and so you wouldn't expect 01:1:27,750 --> 01:1:31,280 01:1:27,760 --> 01:1:33,040 that. That's like irrational. But story 01:1:31,270 --> 01:1:33,040 01:1:31,280 --> 01:1:34,720 is can be a kind of predictability for 01:1:33,030 --> 01:1:34,720 01:1:33,040 --> 01:1:36,400 people. Yeah, absolutely. Stories is how 01:1:34,710 --> 01:1:36,400 01:1:34,720 --> 01:1:37,599 we you say, you know, it's how we think. 01:1:36,390 --> 01:1:37,599 01:1:36,400 --> 01:1:39,359 It's how we make sense of the world. 01:1:37,589 --> 01:1:39,359 01:1:37,599 --> 01:1:41,359 It's, you know, we are stories. We think 01:1:39,349 --> 01:1:41,359 01:1:39,359 --> 01:1:42,880 in stories. So, if you want to persuade 01:1:41,349 --> 01:1:42,880 01:1:41,359 --> 01:1:44,960 people and convince people, you need to 01:1:42,870 --> 01:1:44,960 01:1:42,880 --> 01:1:46,880 do it with story. You know, facts don't 01:1:44,950 --> 01:1:46,880 01:1:44,960 --> 01:1:49,920 really work logic. you know we we don't 01:1:46,870 --> 01:1:49,920 01:1:46,880 --> 01:1:51,599 really we haven't evolved to to to solve 01:1:49,910 --> 01:1:51,599 01:1:49,920 --> 01:1:54,799 you know to understand the world with 01:1:51,589 --> 01:1:54,799 01:1:51,599 --> 01:1:56,240 algorithm and facts and statistics. We 01:1:54,789 --> 01:1:56,240 01:1:54,799 --> 01:1:58,799 you know we think in stories but we 01:1:56,230 --> 01:1:58,799 01:1:56,240 --> 01:2:1,920 believe in stories. So so it's so 01:1:58,789 --> 01:2:1,920 01:1:58,799 --> 01:2:3,720 important to leaders to groups to have a 01:2:1,910 --> 01:2:3,720 01:2:1,920 --> 01:2:5,920 compelling story to tell 01:2:3,710 --> 01:2:5,920 01:2:3,720 --> 01:2:7,520 about what they're doing as a group and 01:2:5,910 --> 01:2:7,520 01:2:5,920 --> 01:2:10,559 and how that interacts with the world in 01:2:7,510 --> 01:2:10,559 01:2:7,520 --> 01:2:12,559 general. Yeah. Um, as we begin to close, 01:2:10,549 --> 01:2:12,559 01:2:10,559 --> 01:2:14,319 I want to basically ask, are there 01:2:12,549 --> 01:2:14,319 01:2:12,559 --> 01:2:16,400 things from A Story Is a Deal that you 01:2:14,309 --> 01:2:16,400 01:2:14,319 --> 01:2:19,040 want me to ask you about?
