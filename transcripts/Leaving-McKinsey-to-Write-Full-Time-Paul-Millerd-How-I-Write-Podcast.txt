I'm not writing for you writing is an act of ego you might as well admit it everyone just agrees to pretend everything is figured out in the book I called a silent conspiracy to like not bring up your insecurity that's so good I started just paying attention to writing how do I write do I write better when I wander more how do I set up my life who am I with what kind of work destroys the Creative Energy and how do you know when you're writing from the heart eventually you cry if you haven't cried yet like you haven't written enough you might be feeling like you're bogged down in your job you're doing work that doesn't inspire you with people who you don't really drive with you want to write you want to be more creative but you just don't know what to do well Paul Millard is our guest today and he wrote a book called The pathless Path because he was feeling that same thing and this was a guy who had done all the big credential things he went to MIT he worked at McKenzie he worked at GE but he said no this traditional path it's not working for me I want something else for my life I want to write fulltime I want the space to think to talk about ideas to read and I'm going to cultivate A Life That's all about that where I'm writing consistently and he's gone on to publish a book that's been a Grassroots success it supports his family it's self-published and he sold almost 50,000 copies now without a lot of marketing so what do we actually talk about well we spoke about tactics and we spoke about some deeper stuff how do you think about writing a first draft after you've had an epiphany how do you edit so that you're writing reads like you're talking to a friend but it was the deeper stuff that really resonated like how do you write in a way that stirs your soul how do you put words onto the page that don't necessarily just come from your mind but come from your heart you know that you're doing it right Paul says when you're moved to tears so here's my conversation with Paul Millard few months in I'm writing the book it is around when I talked to you actually I feel really excited about the book but I feel like something's missing so I actually reach out to Sasha chapen who's a writing Coach and he's just incredible he read through everything and he didn't really give me much feedback he's like it's really good Paul uh you should definitely write this and publish it and I want to read it he's super supportive in that way he's like the opportunity here is for you to go into your personal story and as soon as he said that it was so obvious but then it turned into this like I'm going to write a three-month ebook I don't really know how to do this and pushing my edges in writing personally was very challenging but that was also what made the book writing process so fun and the way I would do that was like I'm writing and I'm just sitting there sort of like remembering and like trying to go back to that moment and like what was it like what was it really like what was it really like I'm just interrogating myself over and over again and then like trying to put the words to it right and so like right at the beginning there's a part I think like page four like growing up I thought making $100,000 a year made someone Rich that was like something I felt so deep for all of growing up when I made that amount for the first time I felt like I had more than I could ever need yet I opted into an identity that didn't accept such complacency that took a really long time to understand myself enough to write that and then everyone around me was always moving forward to the next achievement right and like so connecting that personal I opted into that identity that didn't accept the complacency and you can sort of like feel there's a tension there with me already but at the same time everyone around me is like going going going and that's sort of like the tone for the book but like understanding what I was actually feeling in those moments and then bringing it alive in a way I think thought people would connect with like that was what I was trying to do and how did you go about doing that was that a process of editing was it a process of of walking and wandering yeah so it was all of that I think a book is an incredible portal it opens up a very unique perspective to a specific topic while you're writing it right you open the draft and as soon as I started the draft I'm seeing things everywhere everything's sort of being filtered through that so the conversations the books the like people I'm talking to I'm seeing ideas everywhere and every time I'm talking to them I'm basically like taking notes and dropping them into specific chapters like the book is just chaos at tell me about that taking notes dropping into specific chapters so I might talk to you and bring up something around like writing online and I would just drop a note and a lot of times these are in unintelligible to me later but I sort of always trust that like the good ideas will Bubble Up and emerge and I'm not super detailed around like making sure I capture the essence of everything so I'll drop a note put it in like a chapter create a chapter heading and then revisit it later and a lot of my writing is just rewriting I rewrote some chapters 50 60 times 50 60 well the way I would put that is I'm not the kind of writer that just goes and writes a draft and then lets it sit and goes back and then readed does the edits I write a chapter and then I'll pop in randomly to that chapter and just start reworking sentences reworking sentences reworking senses and so I come back and forth to that now now I'm actually working on another small book but the way I did that I was actually doing that this morning I put my book in ebook format brought it in iPad and then I'm highlighting stuff I want to revisit then I'm going back to the document rewrite rewrite rewrite writing is very verbal too so at the same time I write I read it out loud and so I'm feeling how does this feel in my body does this one feel true does it feel like it's flowing does this something that sounds true to me right and if it sounds I don't believe it or it doesn't even feel good to say like I know it's not there yet so my entire book was just a process of just paying attention to that feeling and then just chipping away like slowly all throughout the book over and over and over again and also I think a model for my book was Tuesdays with Mor have you read that book I haven't it's a story about Mitch album and it's a story about Mory Schwarz at the end of his life and it's incredibly powerful book that has stuck around because it's actually two transformations in one one is Mitch album he was he opens the book with he's working all the time he got the the better car the better house and he was obsessed with the work I think he was newly married and not really present at home he was getting book deals and getting his name all across Sports Publications and then he sees his professor this person that had powerful impact on him in college and it was his opening he sort of documents his own personal transformation while sort of unloading the wisdom of this guy at the end of his life which to me is really inspiring like he was living on his terms he has this idea like don't buy the culture and we live in a world where people complain about the culture all the time well like don't buy it don't open your phone and scroll but the thing is you have to create your own culture right you have to flip it and take responsibility and that's hard and it might be lonely it might suck other people might not join you on the journey it might be financially costly and that book stuck around because follow Mitch album's life now he's adopted people from orphanages in Haiti he volunteers he started writing about like religion and spirituality and Awakening and all these things he slowed down his career he pivoted away from Sports and so the book is true right in the deepest sense right and I wanted to write a true book right not a research back book yes I want to follow this because that's exactly what I was hoping you were going to say because that is what you and I always gripe about is this nonfiction approach to books that's become ey rolling common where you have an anecdote then you have a research study to back it and then you have a clear takeaway and that same cycle happens over and over and over again and you're talking about truth and sure what they're saying could be like oh you know if you do this for 17 minutes in the morning you perform 8% more productively that's true but whatever what really matters is exactly what you're saying the kind of Truth where you're saying something from your core that you believe strongly and you're finding the words to express that clearly and what you're saying lines up with your life and lines up with a deep observation about the nature of reality and there's space for both things but this second kind of Truth this capital T truth feels like it's missing from a lot of book publishing well it's a spectrum right you're going from like personal raw Memoir to like there's a commercially viable book I didn't write my book to reach the biggest audience maybe it will but maybe it won't right but there is a Playbook to do that there is a Playbook to write a book around work that will reach more people that is easier to Market and might also work but I couldn't write that book like it wouldn't have been true to like what I felt one of the things that you've been orbiting around in this conversation so far is not writing for the masses writing for your people and there's a moment fairly early on in your career where you publish something and you get roasted and then you become discouraged and you have this moment of epiphany where you say hold on I'm not writing for those people I'm writing for a specific kind of person and you lean into that and by doing that you become liberated and I want to hear about that emotional Arc yeah so someone I respected emailed me it was like you're naive you're missing the point this is not good and it hurt it made me very defensive and it made me want to run away but at the same time like I thought it mattered right and so I wrote a big email replying and trying to argue right but I realized it was a blog post and it was really a letter to myself and so I cre this blog post I'm not writing for you right I am not writing for the people that are thriving on the default path who have more than enough money to meet their needs and desires right I am writing for the unconventional weirdos that need a different way and need friends along the way around the same time I read Williams Z's book right and he has this line writing is an act of ego you might as well admit it right and that was the second thing it's like okay yeah I mean if you're going to write and share your ideas in the world you want to be heard and you can pretend like you don't which I did early on and I think part of that was just my own fear as well and that was a big release too and so around the same time both of those things I'm just like Let It Rip baby and the next two years I really sort of found my groove I found my people I started leaning into them I got more and more clues I went from like one curiosity conversation every month to maybe a couple every week right and this sort of like curiosity conversation flywheel just started taking off as you were writing the book I guess you were restructuring it all the time huh my idea was I'll write an ebook H I was calling an ebook just to lower the stakes of my S I think so I took all the things I'd written started structuring them in a work Doc and started creating chapter headings and structuring it and moving it around and if you want to write a book this is a great exercise just to see if you actually want to keep going so as soon as I put it in there I was like really excited about the document so you looked at the structure and then you were jazzed this is such a cool puzzle I want to try to figure this out this will be fun and so I put it in there and the biggest problem with going from internet writing to a book book is links links right cuz you're linking to different pieces it's sort of lazy right you're saying oh this this YouTube video you reference and you just link or this person right and so when you writing a book you need to actually say what you think and just tell the reader right and the other thing is you sort of have moves and riffs and so you can only tell the the same story around like your Rel ship to work you can't use the same story 10 times and so you start to see like your patterns and overlaps and for me it was an interesting puzzle because it actually felt like a Consulting project you can think of it as like two modes right bottom up and top down Brandon Sanderson talks talks about this as Discovery writing you just go in and figure it out as you go or outline writing right you figure out the top- down architecture of the book I'm a bottomup person I like to just go into the weeds I don't get overwhelmed by information you can throw infinite amounts of stuff at me in Consulting it's the same thing right you're going into the data and then popping up and trying to figure out the story and then going down and getting more data and popping up and going back down and it's the same thing I was doing with the book so I felt somewhat comfortable with the process early on and confident that I could do it it's like I can work my way through this and I think that's a hard thing for people who haven't had that experience like in a three-month Consulting project you actually don't know where you're going to end up you start with hypothesis and a problem statement and you're letting the data and the story guide you right and eventually you need to learn to trust the process one of the things that I always think about when I'm writing and if I look back at a successful writing session and I say how productive was that it's really easy to think about how many words did I write or did I figure something out but it's I think a more interesting way to evaluate is how much was I able to surprise myself you know Ray Bradbury has this nice line where he says don't think at the typewriter you should be surprising yourself you should be out of your head and I think that writing at its best that's what it's doing you're in something you're restricting yourself to some narrow object of focus you're diving deep into it and all of a sudden you discover how contoured that idea is and all these little nooks and crannies and caves that we hiding inside of that idea and that the point of writing is the surprise I think flow is the word for me when I'm sort of stumbling into maybe yeah a sentence that surprises me that I'm capable of it's like whoa that feels good right it's like a feeling and I often am saying it out loud as I'm writing it and it's like oh this works and that it's like you've sort of solved like that puzzle and then you move on to the next piece and writing it took me 16 months after quitting my job to become aware that writing was such an important thing in my life and I've been calling this like finding your good work what is good work right good work has this deeper um feeling this connectedness to it right this relationship to an activity you know you can do sort of over a long period of time there's no goals with the activity and the goal really becomes like protecting that and that's good work I stumbled upon that like my awareness quit my job wandering around the US sort of doing all these experiments and writing along the way but I moved to Taiwan about 15 months after quitting my job and I had no work I had no plan and I'm sort of sitting there one morning just absolutely delighted that I am writing sitting there with my coffee and no plan and I'm like Oh my this is a thing I can live my life like this and that was it it was like IID found something right and then from that point on IID never exper I had experienced flashes of that in my former work when I was talking about the Consulting projects I flashes but the context was wrong from that point on it was like I need to protect this like this is so much better than what I experienced in my previous path in life that like this is everything like I need to protect this I need to build a life around it and so I was revisiting something I wrote in 2018 and that it's interesting to see how confident I was I think that year I made like 30 grand just like hacking random stuff just to pay very basic bills you're talking about good work and one sign that you're doing that good work is that you're getting downloads because you could think of it supernaturally that a download is a revelation from God and God is basically telling you do more of this and that there's a connectedness there or you could think of this very rationally and logically which is to say you're in a place that your subconscious wants your mind to stir on and it is only when you're aligned with those shower thoughts that you're really doing the right kind of writing for you when I wander more do I write better when I'm talking to people right what how do I set up my life who am I with right who who inspires me what books inspire me what kind of work destroys the Creative Energy how do I avoid that how do I get that out of my life right and so when I'm writing my book I would often just go for long walks or sometimes actually just take weeks off from writing my book just peace out I just feel stuck and it's just a total Vibe there's no strategy or approach it's just like I don't know feel stuck I need to like move just not work on it for like a week and then it always comes it always comes back and so it's sort of trusting that it's there the intro was like this puzzle I couldn't figure out what is it all about how how am I connecting this whole idea what does it mean why does it matter and so I'm just I'm sitting at the desk I'm like oh my I don't know if I can get the intro we're sitting in the southern tip of Taiwan by the beach we were I was living there with my wife Angie and Angie goes go go you need to go wander like go for a scooter ride and she's usually knows like she knows me so well two minutes I go out with the scooter I go on this main road and it just like came to me and I pull over I open my Notepad and I just start writing and like it's it's basically the section why this matters in my in my book book in the intro and it's about my parents but it's also me actually just saying this matters right so the the passage is basically me proclaiming that and so if you go to end of page 11 helping people live courageously so that they can Thrive as one of the most important things in the world I want to see people live the lives they are capable of not just the ones they think they're allowed to live and so that part and the whole part before basically just flowed to me in the side of the road and it was like I basically resolved all my insecurity and shame around sharing ideas in public in that moment like it just went went away and like I was like I care this needs to be said it doesn't even matter if people hear it like I I didn't care if people read the book because like I admitted it to myself I had come to sort of this resolution of a lot of these things I was dealing with and I think on my previous path a lot of my achievement was driven by trying to avoid emotions right and the being on what I call the pathless path like I had to sit with my emotions but how do you actually really sit with them and experience them ful holy and I think writing has been that portal for me to help me sort of transcend those and show up in the world as like who I'm meant to be in the world the two words that are coming to mind are wandering and space of creating a life for for yourself and your process where you can Meander and find things just by following some internal compass that you can't really always understand where it's leading you and then the other thing is just space having the buffer so that angre can say hey get out of here go go on your vesa ride and then you can be there you can pull over to the side of the road you can have that moment then you can write down the thoughts and then the thoughts can pour out you can get into a flow and it all comes out there and in order to do that you need space and I've been thinking a lot about why aren't business books better and one of the reasons that business books aren't better is very simply that the people who write them don't have space they work fulltime they work full-time they don't have space so you end up with the good business books tend to be when people retire and they look back this was sort of an aha for me early on which was I follow all these work writers but something just seem off like there's all these thought leaders that write and talk about things and if you notice what they do they get paid speaking to corporations right so they're in that world and so what is the Assumption of the corporate world and the successful path it's that you work continuously for all of adulthood so you're on the clock for all of adulthood and so I sort of asked what if that's not true right what if you create space for wandering reflection thinking like the natural seasons of life and creativity and all these things and to the world I was in before that is radical right to creative people they're like oh yeah obviously of course and so I realized I could just take that all the way just go all the way with that and I did that by actually just living that as if it were true what if you're not on the clock so take two months off and don't do any work how does that feel turns out at first it feels absolutely terrible right you feel the pressure of the world telling you to get back to work you're a loser you're not worth anything and so a lot of my path over the past seven years has been just like asking those questions and seeing what it feels like and then writing about it one of the things that shows up in your writing process is what you do is you look for Clues from other people the pathless path comes from the three marriages and you find these different phrases words ideas and the way that your brain works is you find these things and they're these little nuggets of potential and you take them and then you mine them deep and deep and deeper deeper deeper and the way that that shows up is you're very good at building upon other people's phrases and coming up with phrases yourself I think when you're exploring ideas you naturally coin stuff all the time so I've coined hundreds of terms most of them don't resonate right and I am finding out through conversation the pathless path when I read it I was like this is this is incredible I texted uh my friend Johnny Miller who gave me the book it's sort of like a magical gift in the first place and I was like this phrase he's like I know it's incredible he had resonated with it too and so I I had this friend from the beginning and we would talk about the phrase the pathless path when I met my wife a month after moving to Taiwan she loved the phrase and it resonated deeply with her when we got married a year later her gift to me was a journal with the phrase the pathless path on it and the the quote that's in the beginning of the book right and it's like we're treating our life as a p pathless path and so it is actually real because it's sort of like the living vision for our family too and yeah every time I put it in writing people would be like I love this phrase or I'd use it in person and people's eyes light up well it's such a good phrase I've spent a lot of time trying to deconstruct why one of the things that I think you have going for you is that it clearly means something so it Spark s an Insight in somebody's mind but it also keeps me curious about what the phrase is so for example if I hear something like Thomas fredman's the World is Flat the problem with that phrase is it gives me too much but the pathless path has the right combination of I get what it means but I also don't get what it means so it Sparks curiosity and it's funny because of that I've probably recommended your book more than any other book at parties and a lot of it is I know how easy it is to pitch the book because the title is so good and every time it just has somebody say oh that's interesting tell me more about it I wasn't super intentional about it it was just obvious that this was the title for years I mean Osho has a book called the pathless path or exploring the pathless path or something right it's a word from spirituality right gateless gate is the phrase in Zen right and I I think it does capture I think it's perfect for the world we're in because my sort of angle on it is everyone's on a pathless path right the problem with the default path isn't the default path it's that people think they're on a safe secure steady and linear path doesn't exist have you talked to anyone that actually has that talk to 60-year-olds and the crazy thing is you talk to old people I would sit around in these conversations I remember this one conversation I was a part of someone's talking about their friend getting laid off a month before their pension hits and losing it entirely another one's talking about like friend that had to go back to work cuz Social Security wasn't enough another one was talking about having to move their family the middle of their career for a job change and restructuring and then they turn and sort of like mocked like how was approaching my path not directly I think a lot of it is their own insecurity and they're sort of buying into this idea that they're on stable smart secure path and I think like my angle on that is that it's not actually broken it's that everyone just agrees to pretend that everything is figured out right I in the book I call it a silent conspiracy to like not bring up your in insecurity that's so good so actually you just did something very interesting there where you took something the way that you were explaining it I was like sure sure sure I've heard that but that is what the work of editing does is when you just said a silent conspiracy I'm like and the ju deposition between what you were saying and the way that you phrased it it just ignites that idea with life yeah and so I I had this feeling in the on my previous path that like everyone was crazy like no one's actually talking about what's really happening in one of my first internships I remember going home and be like nobody's doing anything and like people be like what do you think you don't have to work Buddy and it's like I feel like everyone must be thinking these things right and then when I'm in my like full-time path like thinking the same thing and then discovering after I take my LEAP and when people are talking to me about work and I sort of have the position of random internet stranger that talks about work everyone is finally telling me oh yeah of course we question it all and so it it is a silent conspiracy and so yeah I remember writing that in the book and sort of trying to capture like what is that like what is it like knowing all this information and nobody acknowledges it you wrote a piece with 18 Reflections from from listening to this show how I write and you wrote something so interesting you said what I love about the show is that I disagree with what so many people say because it helps me clarify my own writing process so I'm curious what sorts of things have you heard where you've said I don't do it that way at all and how has this show helped you think about your own creative process yeah everyone just has a different relationship to writing other people like writing everything in one draft I don't do that I write randomly if I don't write every day it's fine I write what I say most days that's sort of my Mantra I don't need the Mantra anymore because I write most days anyway but if I don't write I don't the thing that makes all that work is I think you really enjoy writing it's so fun and so what what about it is so fun for you it's sort of like the joy of finding out right Richard fan says it's figuring out more about my life figuring out more about the world and there's this cycle where it actually just makes my life better I share about what I'm founding the questions I'm asking I put it out there and I find people asking the same questions those people have become some of my best friends and I love these these people and it makes my life more fun and that I have more stuff to write about and I can just sort of like keep doing this right and so it's it's helped me sort of like steer cruise ship into a new way of life and it's just so much better than making PowerPoint slides for a client I don't care about the work of that in the first couple of years of my former career in strategy Consulting was super fun I loved it the first couple of years years it's like a puzzle you're figuring out how to you fit pieces of data and tell a story it's all the stuff I like in writing but eventually you're you're incentivized the care about what a senior partner care cares about for a client paying them a lot of money and they're freaking out they're anxious and they're emailing you on a Saturday and you're out with your friends and it's like I can't care anymore but like my writing it's it's part of my life it's so Inseparable at this point I just love ideas yeah it's funny cuz I love ideas I agree that writing makes my life so much better I love that phrase the joy of finding out because that is writing at its peak I have an idea I know that there's something there and by sitting with that thing I begin to discover new terms new ways of phrasing things that I would have never thought that to me is a joy but also there's a stuckness around writing that really really really frustrates me and I bet if we did some personality assessment you're all the way on the right side of the x-axis on patience and I'm probably all the way to the left side and I just struggle with the patience of I'm going to sit through this as I get stuck and I find the stuckness of like I know I can say this so much better but I can't find it out right now I find that to be so frustrating I mean we have different stories too right you you got frustrated and quit pretty early in your path seven months seven months so I lasted 10 years and so I was so fed up with that path that like I'm just so grateful for writing it's so much better and so even the stuckness I love the stuckness is fun for me so what if I get stuck it's better than a job right we all go on our own Journey right I didn't find or become aware that writing was my thing until 33 years old walk me through a typical day if you're going to be focused on writing how much of that time is spent talking to people ideally walking reading typing I don't have a typical day like today I woke up and I'm working on this book sort of around the idea of like Losing My Edge right everyone so afraid of losing their Edge the truth is you can you might lose your Edge you might accomplish less but it might also be awesome right and so I woke up I worked on that for about an hour before my daughter woke up and I didn't write anything after that after that I actually I wrote a little more so maybe about an hour and a half of writing today then I went to the gym and then because I knew we were talking I left face open so I could sort of like slowly ease into a conversation that matters to me and yeah I sort of approach every day like that like what is what's coming on the day and how do I design my day I think more recently because I had a daughter in the last year I am trying to get more structure in my life before I had Bountiful time and me and my wife sort of always took care of our own things we're good at being independent and like finding the things we want to work on it's harder with a kid with goes without saying so I'm needing to structure that time a little more so I'm actually moving towards like how do I have three blocks of writing a week got to wake up at 4:00 a.m. man no I'm going to do like so I work three days a week we split Child Care me and my wife uh I work three days a week she works too she's also working on a book which is beautiful so those three days right now I'm not doing it but I want to get to okay three hours three days a week that's enough one of the things that you and I connect deeply on Is This Love for ideas and a desperate yearning to find to bring people into our Lives who share that and it's easy to romanticize oh you read on the internet you publish your ideas share things it's like no we need these people in order to feel like we have life because if I can't have these conversations if I can't explore ideas with my friends if I'm not around people who are intellectually stimulating I just die I just die I wither like a plant that hasn't been given water in six years that is why we write and it shows up in the way that you write and how you write which is you're writing for friends you're writing as a bat signal for the kinds of people that you want to attract and it shows up that you're not saying I want to get the biggest readership in the world you're basically saying I'm going to share my story I'm going to do it with honesty and vulnerability and by doing that I want you to email me I want you to reach out to me and I want to spend time with you because if you like my writing the chances that you and I are going to get along well is very high I mean the crazy thing is I thought the reach for this book might be like 500 to a th000 people and now so many people are reaching out and I have a daughter now and I just don't have as much time to connect with these people so I am thinking about like what does that look like like how can I serve this audience and I don't have an answer to that but it's a very alive question we're talking earlier about emails and the quantity of quality emails is the best metric for how I write writing is resonating and I like quantity because obviously you want to like you said you just want to admit that you have an ego and listen to me world I want to be heard that's why we sit down and write so you get that with quantity but the quality thing matters too as writers we have a visceral sense of how well- written thoughtful the emails are and when you get a lot of those well-written thoughtful emails your stuff is resonating it's it's hitting somebody at their core it's making them respond and it's doing it in a way that is counter to the way that so much of the internet is going which is soliciting a hot temperamental short-lived response rather than a slow thoughtful response that has somebody say consider me a fan for for maybe even life sometimes yeah and I I think this is the part people don't understand right CU people get get caught up in not a world of ideas but a world of the media's ideas right or the scripts in their head about how life should work and they'll reach out to me and say don't you think people can't do this if they have like a home and a mortgage and family and it's like I can't explain to that person how badly people need to take an unconventional path of the people that are emailing me and also myself like I felt really alone at the beginning of my path and I had a few people that really rooted for me they went out of their way to email me each week keep going this is so exciting I love what you're up to my writing was objectively not great it was interesting maybe some people saw that I was headed in a direction and I had a handful of these people and they're so important and I actively reach out to people even if they have a big audience or small audience or no audience and I really try to proactively do this with a lot of my time I read a lot of people's early writing and stuff and try to just send them a message hey this is really powerful I hope you keep going let me know how I can help people need that the more people that have belief that they can keep going it's just good for the world you've made me reconsider editing in the sense that I never considered that too much editing could be so destructive and you have a line that I really like where you say as a writer you need to trust your own taste there's two phases for writers phase one you haven't put stuff out in public you're both super insecure about it and also as soon as you put it out there and realize no one's paying attention you want people to pay attention right so you care a lot about what people think is it good bad like you're really unsure about it and so a lot of people really crave feedback but then phase two you're going to find a rhythm and you're going to find an ability to continue writing if somebody's posted 100 of something they could probably do a thousand at a certain point you just need to trust your own writing and the thing is like some people ask for writing and I see other people's feedback a lot of feedback is not good because the best feedback is really about like pointing the writer in a different Direction it's either like oh this paragraph is gold and then I know okay how do I strengthen the ones above and below it because they're probably not as strong or there's a big chunk where nobody comments at all it's like maybe this is a little boring maybe I need to rethink this or somebody says this is confusing that makes me think and I might rewrite the whole thing or reframe everything based on that one comment I mean I still have not found like great editors I found a good editor on my newsletter who edited my stuff for my book uh but I don't ask for feedback for 99% of the things I write I only had five people read my book before I published it and all I had them do was say what do you love and I told the editor don't delete any of those how did you know that your book was ready it's so hard it's just sort of like a feeling it probably wasn't 100% % ready this is the the benefit of self-publishing U but minor errors the book was ready in story I thought I'd be ready I thought I was at 98% done when I was at like 90% done right and that final stretch can take a long time and that's where having people help you can be useful but I was doing everything myself so what I was doing was printing out the book and reading it straight through and making edits then I would put it on Kindle and I would highlight things I wanted to revisit and just like go through the book and then I would read the book out loud to me to myself and noticing things that don't flow and make sense and then when you're reading an entire book you repeat stuff right oh this doesn't match this this this is sort of planting the seed to this point how does that connect how do you tighten that up and so it's very much just like feeling I probably read my book know 25 times in in the last month and the crazy thing is when you do that like you're sort of looking at hieroglyphics at the end this doesn't make any sense this is nonsense but then you just have to trust it and I just posted it I find that it's time to ship when I feel one of two emotions oh my goodness this is the best thing I've ever written in my entire life everyone needs to see this or I absolutely hate this I'm looking at hieroglyphic now I can't even read and just get out of my life and it's time to publish I just have no more patience for it and to switch gears I think that one of the things that you've hit on is how many contemporary bloggers are publishing books that are really resonating Thiago Forte Mark Manson RIT sethy obviously James Clear they're getting cycles of feedback they're talking to people they're spending years in conversation with their readers before they ever publish and it seems to be quite an advantage I mean it's just an obvious Advantage right more iterations of really fast rapid feedback are going to be better than publishing a book every three years and then getting Mass Market feedback right the big publishing houses require you to give them a pitch on non-fiction books right and they want to make sure that it maps to something that will already resonate right so that can work but like I mean their heris they're using instead is like let's just scoop people up that have already validated ideas with an audience right but if you are just cold pitching an idea the odds are you're probably not going to write the most powerful thing right because they're going to pick the things that are safe and already resonate that they can validate right the best ideas and this is why like I think there's a promise of self-publishing is a lot of the best ideas might be people with smaller audiences like me who are on to something powerful that doesn't map to how the media or the popular narratives see it right I had 5,000 newsletter subscribers I wouldn't have gotten a book deal but like I I felt this urgent need to like I have to put it out there and I was keeping a Blog after college I had a Blog in grad school I had a blog when I had Lyme disease the theme is I was always writing but I wasn't paying attention to the feeling of writing I was so embodied in the worker Identity or not embodied that I wasn't noticing that writing could be a thing and I think maybe it couldn't have been a thing then like the way the internet exists and the way you can put ideas out now but yeah I've written about tons of stuff yeah you and I are so different in this way I I never had that passion for writing I think I do have a real passion for communication for framing ideas writing for me is such a slog it's really hard and I actually think that's part of the reason that I can teach writing well is when I talk to a writer passage student they're like I don't really like writing very much or writing is incredibly difficult for me I go ah I know that feeling and I know that writing is supremely useful and having written something that you're proud of such a good feeling but the process of doing that for me is always hard so you talk about not needing discipline I totally need discipline because if I don't put time into my calendar do some sort of streak of trying to write I just won't do it because it's the hardest it's the hardest thing and when I look at my day moving forward or what I'm in the mood to do right now it's never writing but if I were to look back at a year and I were to say what is the best thing I can do with my time it's writing so I need to build systems and structures into my life to make sure that I do it do you think this is your writing this show yeah I love doing this I think this is your writing love doing this yeah when I see you doing this you come alive with the same energy I have for writing the conversation I just have the conversation with words like you're so good at the conversation with like talking and bringing it out of people I find it so interesting how every guest is a radically different way of approaching the craft it's astonishing that how I right can yield so many different answers you know like you always think of how a like a card deck you throw it on the ground all the different combinations that's how I feel about the writing process yeah like Mark Andre he talks about like reading all the current stuff and then all the old stuff it's same with me too I read a lot of current stuff it doesn't really bother me to take away my energy I find it kind of fun early on in the book you pull from the Canon of people who've written about work and you talk about Mox vber and different people who had written about what you had written about I don't think you get enough credit for how well read you are in the Canon of this topic oh I just snuck the nerdy internet book into my personal Memoir what the Protestant ethic no like the book is this combo like chapter 3 I didn't really know where to position chapter 3 chapter 3 is a the it's called work work work it's basically a deep dive into the history of work and so when I started the book that was the book I was going to write this like non-fiction deep dive about the history and philosophy of work right and then I realized it's about the personal story right and so chapter 3 really could have gone anywhere but I was like I need to hit the reader with this deep dive in the history of work and it's going to get super nerdy and we're going to go all the way back and it's my telling of like how things happen and piecing together all these things through like Thomas aquinus and the work ethic and all these things and like the quotes from Eric CH and escape to freedom and like how Freedom sort of changed in the 1950s and then I'm sprinkling in like organization man and how they're talking about how people thought about work right after World War II and how that's led to today and Leisure and peer and all these things and so yeah it's it's a super nerdy book I mean there's over 200 references so I sort of tried to pack like many books in one I think my challenge with a lot of traditionally published books is there's sort of light on depth and I wrote this for nerdy internet people exactly like you where I'm tossing in super nerdy quote knowing that you're going to write it down and go on your own rabbit hole and then I just move I just keep moving it's like nerdy quote personal reflection another nerdy quote historical fact like boom boom like I I really thought about like just going super dense and so you could easily have expanded the book to like three different books right there's the default path in the history of work there's like the Creator economy and exploring all that and then there's also like falling in love with writing and all that and yeah that's sort of what I wanted to do mainly because I just don't like most of the books that are coming out now will you coach me on my book sure you need to go into your personal story because your personal story is where the power is like when you talk about how frustrating school was like that is so powerful that is the truth that gives the credibility to the journey the writing the sharing ideas all that how did you learn how to tell your personal story with so much Fidelity because that's just not something I've experienced with telling the story of a life a Health crisis feeling lost and alone yeah really just being broken over open and also after quitting my job feeling alone and feeling this jolt of reality like wow I'm really lost now I don't have a story for my life and I had to get to know myself but I had started that process years earlier through a Health crisis when I sort of had to sit myself and sit with myself and figure out who I was and then through writing about that over the years like you just reflect so much and a lot of what I'm doing is just reflecting right and you write hundreds of posts about yourself eventually you figure out some how do you think about the pacing in your stories I do have research in my book this study from David D and gilovich talk about the ideal self and the ought to self right the ideal self is who we want to Aspire to be the a to self is like I ought to take care of people right and so I could have went three four pages these guys did this study and it was these conclusions and they found this but really I'm just telling it through my own personal lens right and it's like oh I leaned heavily on the a to self oh I ought to stay employed I ought to do these things and then as soon as I took the leap I realized oh like your a to self is always there it always takes care of what it needs to take care of and if it does make mistakes oh you didn't make enough money the last few months it will correct you can take actions right and so not pursuing your ideal self as I'm telling it in my personal story it's like super powerful right so I'm moving through that quickly I'm not trying to linger on the study I'm trying to just like keep the action moving right you a lot of it's my own impatience like I want to just keep moving I want things to be easy to read when I read it I want it to flow I want it to feel conversational your writing doesn't have a lot of friction I learned this from Nick muli I asked him one time how do you edit and he said I read and I read and what I read for is every time that I get caught on something yeah same and whenever I get caught I say something's up there so I'm just going to polish it's like ironing a shirt okay I'm going to iron that part of the shirt I'm going to get the wrinkle out okay I'm going to keep going I'm going to get caught on something else and that editing at least the final rounds of it are making sure that you don't get caught on things so that then you have that flow and that ease yeah this morning I was editing something it started out most days uh I was waking up not feeling great and I would decide to do something each day so I don't remember the specific sentence but like day day like I'm like ah that like my brain like gets stuck and so I highlight days that I'm going back and I'm like okay most days most days most days I'm like saying it out loud I'm trying different stuff like typing as I'm going and until I get to that flow like I'm not going to ship stuff now my newsletters and like Twitter and stuff I'm just shipping stuff I'm not really editing that but for a book I'm going back in a again until I remove all that friction and it was cool to see when I read my audiobook there were probably three times I felt friction which felt it was like okay I I didn't think about that beforehand like I didn't actually think about recording an audio book until I published it but um yeah I was like oh that is my approach to sort of just sound things out as I'm going yeah and then the other kind of editing this is the one that I find much harder is mapping the intensity of an experience so I feel something deeply something happened that I want to put words to and the lazy thing to do is to go to a the Taurus and go from interested to curious to fascinated okay that's that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about finding some analogy or knowing what moment to zoom into to really make that experience come alive and I've learned from Robert Caro when he would do interview with people who were in the lives of his subjects Robert Moses and then LBJ he would keep asking what would I see if I was there what would I see if I was there what would I see if I was there and he' say over and over and over again and what I got was make the reader see the scene and the way that you get people to see is not by being comprehensive but by being descriptive when it matters and using words and references that everybody knows that are super specific and that's what injects life into the writing I don't think I do that well so it's something I struggle with too I think what I do is give different context I'll sort of switch tense to like abstract idea to then personal reflection to then broader application I was reading that phrase earlier in the interview I had opted into an identity that didn't accept complacency personal feeling and then next reflection everyone around me was going to keep going right so people can sort of I think what I'm looking for is like people can feel that connection and a lot of it is like I'm just trying to talk to somebody like I'm talking to a friend you really do that and for you you're pretty plain and Direct in your speech yeah get to the point and your writing feels like that what' you take from Seth Goden I don't have like Role Models what I think I have is many sort of like possibility archetypes it's knowing that certain ways of doing things are possible right so Seth Coden later in life still actively engaged energized by creative work okay file that in my head possible Right someone like Derek cers writes books on his own terms sell sells them directly to his 01:0:1,230 --> 01:0:4,319 01:0:1,240 --> 01:0:7,559 audience okay that's possible right it's 01:0:4,309 --> 01:0:7,559 01:0:4,319 --> 01:0:10,960 sort of this like possibility through 01:0:7,549 --> 01:0:10,960 01:0:7,559 --> 01:0:13,160 implicit permission right Tim Ferris is 01:0:10,950 --> 01:0:13,160 01:0:10,960 --> 01:0:16,200 somebody I Look to he's reinvented 01:0:13,150 --> 01:0:16,200 01:0:13,160 --> 01:0:18,559 himself many times he's walked away 01:0:16,190 --> 01:0:18,559 01:0:16,200 --> 01:0:21,680 from like Angel 01:0:18,549 --> 01:0:21,680 01:0:18,559 --> 01:0:24,280 Investing that's very hard to do walking 01:0:21,670 --> 01:0:24,280 01:0:21,680 --> 01:0:26,559 away from more money is and an identity 01:0:24,270 --> 01:0:26,559 01:0:24,280 --> 01:0:27,720 of success is often much harder than not 01:0:26,549 --> 01:0:27,720 01:0:26,559 --> 01:0:30,599 having an 01:0:27,710 --> 01:0:30,599 01:0:27,720 --> 01:0:33,799 identity right so people like that like 01:0:30,589 --> 01:0:33,799 01:0:30,599 --> 01:0:37,559 David White like leaning into to being a 01:0:33,789 --> 01:0:37,559 01:0:33,799 --> 01:0:39,920 poet and like literally just being bold 01:0:37,549 --> 01:0:39,920 01:0:37,559 --> 01:0:42,880 enough to do that in his 30s and call 01:0:39,910 --> 01:0:42,880 01:0:39,920 --> 01:0:44,960 himself a poet and write so 01:0:42,870 --> 01:0:44,960 01:0:42,880 --> 01:0:46,799 beautifully right and knowing these 01:0:44,950 --> 01:0:46,799 01:0:44,960 --> 01:0:48,799 things exist and having these Role 01:0:46,789 --> 01:0:48,799 01:0:46,799 --> 01:0:51,200 Models like we talked about Rait s 01:0:48,789 --> 01:0:51,200 01:0:48,799 --> 01:0:53,799 before he's still talking about I will 01:0:51,190 --> 01:0:53,799 01:0:51,200 --> 01:0:58,280 teach you to be rich he wrote that book 01:0:53,789 --> 01:0:58,280 01:0:53,799 --> 01:1:1,359 in 2009 I think years ago what I get 01:0:58,270 --> 01:1:1,359 01:0:58,280 --> 01:1:4,079 from that book I don't want to be REM 01:1:1,349 --> 01:1:4,079 01:1:1,359 --> 01:1:6,000 but just the fact that that's possible 01:1:4,069 --> 01:1:6,000 01:1:4,079 --> 01:1:8,640 oh you can remain engaged and excited 01:1:5,990 --> 01:1:8,640 01:1:6,000 --> 01:1:12,599 about a book and a set of ideas that's 01:1:8,630 --> 01:1:12,599 01:1:8,640 --> 01:1:14,359 cool because most people move on a lot 01:1:12,589 --> 01:1:14,359 01:1:12,599 --> 01:1:17,200 of entrepreneurs and creators and there 01:1:14,349 --> 01:1:17,200 01:1:14,359 --> 01:1:22,480 aren't many that are like 15 years plus 01:1:17,190 --> 01:1:22,480 01:1:17,200 --> 01:1:24,400 on these paths it's that they he gives 01:1:22,470 --> 01:1:24,400 01:1:22,480 --> 01:1:26,640 permission that oh of course you can 01:1:24,390 --> 01:1:26,640 01:1:24,400 --> 01:1:29,400 remain engaged in an idea I don't need 01:1:26,630 --> 01:1:29,400 01:1:26,640 --> 01:1:30,880 to search for the next thing right I 01:1:29,390 --> 01:1:30,880 01:1:29,400 --> 01:1:33,079 might still be talking about the 01:1:30,870 --> 01:1:33,079 01:1:30,880 --> 01:1:35,240 pathless path in8 years that's kind of 01:1:33,069 --> 01:1:35,240 01:1:33,079 --> 01:1:37,079 cool to think about and it sort of re 01:1:35,230 --> 01:1:37,079 01:1:35,240 --> 01:1:39,160 releases the pressure to like oh you 01:1:37,069 --> 01:1:39,160 01:1:37,079 --> 01:1:41,599 have to have a next book or do all these 01:1:39,150 --> 01:1:41,599 01:1:39,160 --> 01:1:43,359 things it's like no you can actually 01:1:41,589 --> 01:1:43,359 01:1:41,599 --> 01:1:45,440 just let that evolve naturally and see 01:1:43,349 --> 01:1:45,440 01:1:43,359 --> 01:1:48,599 where it takes you it's this concept of 01:1:45,430 --> 01:1:48,599 01:1:45,440 --> 01:1:51,279 a core idea which is such a focus of 01:1:48,589 --> 01:1:51,279 01:1:48,599 --> 01:1:53,559 what we're doing at right of passage 01:1:51,269 --> 01:1:53,559 01:1:51,279 --> 01:1:56,240 because it's not that you need to say 01:1:53,549 --> 01:1:56,240 01:1:53,559 --> 01:2:1,559 the same things over and over again but 01:1:56,230 --> 01:2:1,559 01:1:56,240 --> 01:2:4,240 it is really nice to have a central 01:2:1,549 --> 01:2:4,240 01:2:1,559 --> 01:2:6,760 idea that is true to who you are what 01:2:4,230 --> 01:2:6,760 01:2:4,240 --> 01:2:6,760 you stand 01:2:6,990 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:2:7,000 --> 01:2:13,160 for and you orbit around it and it's 01:2:11,269 --> 01:2:13,160 01:2:11,279 --> 01:2:14,960 just a theme that emerges a question 01:2:13,150 --> 01:2:14,960 01:2:13,160 --> 01:2:17,520 that I like to ask people for them to 01:2:14,950 --> 01:2:17,520 01:2:14,960 --> 01:2:19,400 find it is what does your head want you 01:2:17,510 --> 01:2:19,400 01:2:17,520 --> 01:2:21,520 to write about what does your heart want 01:2:19,390 --> 01:2:21,520 01:2:19,400 --> 01:2:24,520 you to write about what does your wallet 01:2:21,510 --> 01:2:24,520 01:2:21,520 --> 01:2:27,760 want you to write about and when people 01:2:24,510 --> 01:2:27,760 01:2:24,520 --> 01:2:31,240 have aign between head heart wallet they 01:2:27,750 --> 01:2:31,240 01:2:27,760 --> 01:2:34,240 end up finding this core idea that they 01:2:31,230 --> 01:2:34,240 01:2:31,240 --> 01:2:35,960 don't get tired of and it's easy to look 01:2:34,230 --> 01:2:35,960 01:2:34,240 --> 01:2:38,200 at somebody else's and they say well i' 01:2:35,950 --> 01:2:38,200 01:2:35,960 --> 01:2:40,160 get tired of writing about how to teach 01:2:38,190 --> 01:2:40,160 01:2:38,200 --> 01:2:41,799 people to be rich or I would get tired 01:2:40,150 --> 01:2:41,799 01:2:40,160 --> 01:2:43,760 of writing about the pathless path but 01:2:41,789 --> 01:2:43,760 01:2:41,799 --> 01:2:46,960 that's because that's not your core idea 01:2:43,750 --> 01:2:46,960 01:2:43,760 --> 01:2:48,559 right and when you find it your internal 01:2:46,950 --> 01:2:48,559 01:2:46,960 --> 01:2:50,760 experience of that idea feels very 01:2:48,549 --> 01:2:50,760 01:2:48,559 --> 01:2:53,039 expansive but then to the rest of the 01:2:50,750 --> 01:2:53,039 01:2:50,760 --> 01:2:55,880 world it's super specific and legible 01:2:53,029 --> 01:2:55,880 01:2:53,039 --> 01:2:57,880 and that's a good place to be I think I 01:2:55,870 --> 01:2:57,880 01:2:55,880 --> 01:3:0,240 think the Trap people get into with this 01:2:57,870 --> 01:3:0,240 01:2:57,880 --> 01:3:3,119 is they think there's a niche they can 01:3:0,230 --> 01:3:3,119 01:3:0,240 --> 01:3:5,880 aim at like they think they can aim at a 01:3:3,109 --> 01:3:5,880 01:3:3,119 --> 01:3:7,200 niche like it's a job right I'll just 01:3:5,870 --> 01:3:7,200 01:3:5,880 --> 01:3:8,440 get the application right and I'll get 01:3:7,190 --> 01:3:8,440 01:3:7,200 --> 01:3:10,760 everything right and then I'll get there 01:3:8,430 --> 01:3:10,760 01:3:8,440 --> 01:3:14,599 and then it'll be set really the best 01:3:10,750 --> 01:3:14,599 01:3:10,760 --> 01:3:17,839 Niche is like the niche of you right 01:3:14,589 --> 01:3:17,839 01:3:14,599 --> 01:3:20,039 because and you can land in a niche but 01:3:17,829 --> 01:3:20,039 01:3:17,839 --> 01:3:21,960 often they can be very constraining 01:3:20,029 --> 01:3:21,960 01:3:20,039 --> 01:3:23,839 right you can feel like you can't 01:3:21,950 --> 01:3:23,839 01:3:21,960 --> 01:3:25,480 publish stuff and this is why sometimes 01:3:23,829 --> 01:3:25,480 01:3:23,839 --> 01:3:28,079 people blow up stuff they've been 01:3:25,470 --> 01:3:28,079 01:3:25,480 --> 01:3:31,279 working on for years to try and create 01:3:28,069 --> 01:3:31,279 01:3:28,079 --> 01:3:33,000 that space of exploration right I don't 01:3:31,269 --> 01:3:33,000 01:3:31,279 --> 01:3:34,440 really feel like I have to write about 01:3:32,990 --> 01:3:34,440 01:3:33,000 --> 01:3:37,680 the pathless 01:3:34,430 --> 01:3:37,680 01:3:34,440 --> 01:3:40,119 path like the niche is really me it's 01:3:37,670 --> 01:3:40,119 01:3:37,680 --> 01:3:42,760 the niche of what I'm actually curious 01:3:40,109 --> 01:3:42,760 01:3:40,119 --> 01:3:44,839 about and so people ask do you worry 01:3:42,750 --> 01:3:44,839 01:3:42,760 --> 01:3:47,000 about like what your audience wants you 01:3:44,829 --> 01:3:47,000 01:3:44,839 --> 01:3:49,640 to write about or what's going to it's 01:3:46,990 --> 01:3:49,640 01:3:47,000 --> 01:3:51,920 like no I don't I'm just writing about 01:3:49,630 --> 01:3:51,920 01:3:49,640 --> 01:3:53,599 what I'm curious about this week some 01:3:51,910 --> 01:3:53,599 01:3:51,920 --> 01:3:56,799 stuff resonates some doesn't but I'm 01:3:53,589 --> 01:3:56,799 01:3:53,599 --> 01:3:59,400 just going to keep going if you were to 01:3:56,789 --> 01:3:59,400 01:3:56,799 --> 01:4:3,160 teach a class on 01:3:59,390 --> 01:4:3,160 01:3:59,400 --> 01:4:3,160 writing what would be in the 01:4:3,390 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:4:3,400 --> 01:4:8,920 syllabus non work everyone would have to 01:4:6,750 --> 01:4:8,920 01:4:6,760 --> 01:4:12,839 stop writing and go for a three-hour 01:4:8,910 --> 01:4:12,839 01:4:8,920 --> 01:4:15,799 walk oh that's great no 01:4:12,829 --> 01:4:15,799 01:4:12,839 --> 01:4:18,079 destination and just wander and see 01:4:15,789 --> 01:4:18,079 01:4:15,799 --> 01:4:20,400 where it takes you the mission there is 01:4:18,069 --> 01:4:20,400 01:4:18,079 --> 01:4:22,839 really just to sit with the discomfort 01:4:20,390 --> 01:4:22,839 01:4:20,400 --> 01:4:25,880 and see what comes up because if you 01:4:22,829 --> 01:4:25,880 01:4:22,839 --> 01:4:31,279 want to write that is a creative act in 01:4:25,870 --> 01:4:31,279 01:4:25,880 --> 01:4:32,319 a creative act is very hard to do in 01:4:31,269 --> 01:4:32,319 01:4:31,279 --> 01:4:35,279 rational 01:4:32,309 --> 01:4:35,279 01:4:32,319 --> 01:4:36,880 mode of like playing tactics and going 01:4:35,269 --> 01:4:36,880 01:4:35,279 --> 01:4:40,839 after it right you really need to 01:4:36,870 --> 01:4:40,839 01:4:36,880 --> 01:4:43,520 connect with like you said the heart you 01:4:40,829 --> 01:4:43,520 01:4:40,839 --> 01:4:44,920 need to awaken the heart a phrase you 01:4:43,510 --> 01:4:44,920 01:4:43,520 --> 01:4:47,960 say Heart's On 01:4:44,910 --> 01:4:47,960 01:4:44,920 --> 01:4:51,400 Fire know it you need to know that that 01:4:47,950 --> 01:4:51,400 01:4:47,960 --> 01:4:53,520 state exists and play with your state 01:4:51,390 --> 01:4:53,520 01:4:51,400 --> 01:4:56,319 and try different experiments and see 01:4:53,510 --> 01:4:56,319 01:4:53,520 --> 01:4:58,480 how you can get closer to that state 01:4:56,309 --> 01:4:58,480 01:4:56,319 --> 01:5:0,520 and the thing I tell people is if you 01:4:58,470 --> 01:5:0,520 01:4:58,480 --> 01:5:2,920 knew there was a relationship with work 01:5:0,510 --> 01:5:2,920 01:5:0,520 --> 01:5:4,200 that would feel so good that you knew 01:5:2,910 --> 01:5:4,200 01:5:2,920 --> 01:5:5,880 without a doubt you could do it for the 01:5:4,190 --> 01:5:5,880 01:5:4,200 --> 01:5:7,559 rest of your life wouldn't you try to go 01:5:5,870 --> 01:5:7,559 01:5:5,880 --> 01:5:11,119 find 01:5:7,549 --> 01:5:11,119 01:5:7,559 --> 01:5:14,359 that so a lot of the exercises would be 01:5:11,109 --> 01:5:14,359 01:5:11,119 --> 01:5:16,720 around trying to find that and how do 01:5:14,349 --> 01:5:16,720 01:5:14,359 --> 01:5:20,359 01:5:16,710 --> 01:5:20,359 01:5:16,720 --> 01:5:22,960 heart I think eventually you 01:5:20,349 --> 01:5:22,960 01:5:20,359 --> 01:5:25,319 cry I think eventually it breaks you 01:5:22,950 --> 01:5:25,319 01:5:22,960 --> 01:5:27,160 because you get so deep and this is sort 01:5:25,309 --> 01:5:27,160 01:5:25,319 --> 01:5:28,680 of one thing I might tell people I 01:5:27,150 --> 01:5:28,680 01:5:27,160 --> 01:5:31,160 actually did this 01:5:28,670 --> 01:5:31,160 01:5:28,680 --> 01:5:33,960 exercise a couple years 01:5:31,150 --> 01:5:33,960 01:5:31,160 --> 01:5:37,880 before I wrote my book where it's you 01:5:33,950 --> 01:5:37,880 01:5:33,960 --> 01:5:40,039 write your life purpose until you cry 01:5:37,870 --> 01:5:40,039 01:5:37,880 --> 01:5:43,079 you write you write it you write it you 01:5:40,029 --> 01:5:43,079 01:5:40,039 --> 01:5:44,799 write it and it took me about 21 times 01:5:43,069 --> 01:5:44,799 01:5:43,079 --> 01:5:47,799 to write it and then I 01:5:44,789 --> 01:5:47,799 01:5:44,799 --> 01:5:52,960 cried and the mission I came up with I 01:5:47,789 --> 01:5:52,960 01:5:47,799 --> 01:5:55,960 won't get it correct exactly but it was 01:5:52,950 --> 01:5:55,960 01:5:52,960 --> 01:5:57,880 like explore ideas and creativity that 01:5:55,950 --> 01:5:57,880 01:5:55,960 --> 01:6:0,279 matters to me and share them with 01:5:57,870 --> 01:6:0,279 01:5:57,880 --> 01:6:1,960 friends right and it was all about like 01:6:0,269 --> 01:6:1,960 01:6:0,279 --> 01:6:4,200 something around connecting with friends 01:6:1,950 --> 01:6:4,200 01:6:1,960 --> 01:6:6,039 and helping people realize that things 01:6:4,190 --> 01:6:6,039 01:6:4,200 --> 01:6:8,119 matter to them it's exactly the phrase 01:6:6,029 --> 01:6:8,119 01:6:6,039 --> 01:6:9,079 that appeared in my book that I sort of 01:6:8,109 --> 01:6:9,079 01:6:8,119 --> 01:6:12,200 had to 01:6:9,069 --> 01:6:12,200 01:6:9,079 --> 01:6:16,039 re learn 01:6:12,190 --> 01:6:16,039 01:6:12,200 --> 01:6:18,440 and yeah I
