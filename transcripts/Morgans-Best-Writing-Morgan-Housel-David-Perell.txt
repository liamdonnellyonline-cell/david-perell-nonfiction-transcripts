out of all the articles that you've written which one are you most proud of and why i would name two um one is one i wrote a couple months ago called the three sides of risk which was about a story of two friends really good friends who i grew up with skiing were killed in an avalanche and i was going to whip them the day that they died i kind of told that whole story and the other was a couple years ago i wrote an article about uh i grew up with and still have a fairly chronic stutter when i talk i was able to overcome it i write about how i was able to overcome it not a hundred percent i still stutter um but those two were important to me because they were very personal and they were very challenging times and still are and i think people i think a lot so much of what happens online whether it's instagram or blogs is people putting forth innocently this curated highlights of their life on blogs that's look how smart i am on instagram it's look how beautiful i am look how much fun i'm having and so much of it is just bs because everyone's struggling in life everyone's got problems everyone's got issues everyone's got insecurities everyone's been through rough patches that never get talked about and when you write about challenging times in your life growing up with a speech disability one you know being next to your two best friends when they die when you write about these times i think people appreciate the honesty because they're yearning for it because everything else they see on life is this curated highlights reel so i think if you i think the articles did well because of that and they just meant a lot to me to me because they were painful periods that i kind of had compartmentalized in my life don't want to think about it that much don't want to talk about it whereas if you just open yourself up and throw it all in the paper it actually felt really good yeah the two things that stick out from both of them was you in the one about your stutter you watching barry speak at a conference wondering how you could ever do that and then the way that you sort of end that essay talk about how you did that and then that sort of has this beautiful sick circular cyclical narrative that i really appreciated and then with the three sides of risk there's one line where it's so beautiful i think it's like the phone rings and and you sort of say that your friends had died but nobody actually said it overtly and i forget exactly what you said but it was so beautiful man so uh you know during this period where my friends were missing we didn't know what happened to them yet one of their mothers called me and said morgan brian didn't show up for work today do you know where he is and i told his mom the truth yes we skied out of bounds this morning uh i was gonna they he and brandon were did it again i was gonna pick them up on the road but they never showed up and i have not seen them since and uh she said oh my god and hung up the phone and i think that was the moment where both of us i think i don't want to speak for her but i assume it was definitely true for me we both pieced together what happened you know we both pieced together that they skied out of bounds which is a very dangerous thing to do under those conditions where the avalanche risk was so high and no one had seen them since it was like let's connect the dots here no one wanted to see that of course you don't know you don't want to jump conclusions but i remember at the end of that phone call just kind of sitting quietly and being like like i didn't even want to say it in my head but i think i just felt it it was like you you could figure out what happened
