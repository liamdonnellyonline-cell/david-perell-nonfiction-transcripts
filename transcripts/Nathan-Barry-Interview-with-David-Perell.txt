awesome well I will I'll get into this so hi I'm David for Elle thank you to all of you who are here joining us so I run an online writing course called the rite of passage that you probably know about the next cohort starts next Wednesday so six days from now and so this is a part of writing week where every single day for like eight days I'm hosting a workshop so there is like a lot a session of me writing my newsletter this weekend a live Q&A this weekend and we hosted the pop writing workshop yesterday interview with Alex Danko on Tuesday and today with Nathan Berry so basically the back the the background of Nathan is so I so he's the CEO and founder of a company called convertkit and I use convertkit to send all my emails so whenever you get an email for me it comes from convertkit and it's built for basically creators like myself it's built for people who have online audiences and want to build a business around those audiences but I found Nathan from this interview that he did with a guy named Patrick McKenzie in like 2013 and 2014 he's laughing right now and basically this area was so good and it made me realize I was doing some consulting at the time you know yadda yadda and I was just trying to figure out what am I gonna do with my life and basically they had this term called productized consulting that they were talking about and so I used some of the ideas from that interview started following Nathan on Twitter and a lot of the ideas that Nathan had been putting out for years were things that I was arriving at on my own and so my relationship with Nathan has always felt very telepathic and we talked on the phone for the first time a couple weeks ago and I said hey come on let's do an interview so Nathan welcome to the welcome to zoom it's great to finally see your face for the first time and why don't you say hello and then I have a load of questions for you brother yeah sounds good well I appreciate the welcome it's been kind of interesting is you've been publishing you know over the last couple years I feel like it's the last year in particular that you know you've started to dominate my Twitter feed and you and with so many of these thoughts attention you say like telepathic in that way because like there's so many things that you write about an audience being a superpower and these different things you know just focus on writing all these other things and I'm like yes that's it that's exactly it and so I appreciate the prolific nature with which you i detach everything online because you put out far more content than I do it so many things that I want to be saying and so it's always fun when I think there was an article or a Twitter where you were talking about something with audience building and then someone says oh I bet Nathan berry has similar thoughts and then I chime in it was like here's another five years ago that you know yeah and just stuff that I haven't had a chance to write about mourn so I'm really excited to be diving into all of this and talking about it with you well it's funny because I was reading your book Authority just in preparation for this and talk about how you wrote basically what you would do is you would write a thousand words a day and you developed an app to help yourself commit to that habit so why don't you talk about building that writing habit a lot of people say oh it's really hard I don't know if the top I am how have you is especially in the early days when things were difficult for you how did you develop the writing habit what were some of the rules that you set for yourself yeah so the writing habit came about from following a guy named Chris Caleb oh so he's written a bunch of books his first book was called the ironic conformity and then he wrote the hundred dollar startup and he's written a bunch since then and I came across his stuff he was kind of the first person to show me that you can make money online by writing content by self-publishing all of us you know he outlined the path for me and he has this quote where he talks about you know writing a book a year is not that difficult and and I'm like John a book a year that I mean that sounds hard to me he goes yeah you know I read a book a year um a hundred blog posts for my site maybe 50 or so guest posts a couple long-form magazine pieces and maybe a couple of self-published books and I'm like what the hell how do you do this in a year and he just keeps going is like yeah it's not that hard if you just write a thousand words a day and that was like okay that the bar that he's trying to hit as far as content creation is so far beyond what I'm doing like just night and day different that you know it's thinking about that like okay that's insane if I can achieve even a tiny portion of that that would be incredible because I don't want to write a book a year I just want to write a book in any amount of time but even accomplishing that would be a huge change so I guess I I set out to you know write that thousand words a day I was remember Tim Ferriss talking one point about how like a thousand words is like to copy pages you just it doesn't have to be good you know can you write a couple pages a day and and so I set out to do that and I really like the Jerry Seinfeld don't break the chain idea that went around on Reddit forever ago and I think has since been debunked is not being from Jerry Seinfeld I don't I don't even know but it stuck with me and I was like okay I'm going to build this habit so I procrastinated by first building an app to track the habit but I feel like that's what developers do is you have to first I don't know go procrastinate by designing something or building building software but I just started you know got three days in a row and then missed a day and then next time I got like seven or eight days in a row and missed a day and then that kinda I was like I'm about 15 days in a row and I almost missed a day but then I was like no I'm gonna break that streak you know I popped up and reminded me and so then it went up from there by the time I wished my book the app design book I had 80 days in a row of writing it today and actually the way that I continued was I published the book it made more money in a day than I expected to make over the entire lifetime of the book my goal was ten thousand dollars off of the book it made twelve thousand the first day geez and so then the next day I'm like writing this high from you know all the success publishing the book and everything else I'm like oh this is amazing you know there's hacker news comments people are saying the books really good there's how can use comments saying is terrible because honestly attacker news and they just hung a lot of things but you know then my app popped up and said are you gonna write a thousand words today and I went no like I'm done like I checked off that like the book is written what else would I even write about I guess I could write actually I think the day after I wrote a summary blog post about the whole experience and then the day after that you know it was like day 81 are you gonna walk write a thousand words and I was like I don't even know what I write about but I don't want to break an 81 day writing streak and so I said I guess I could write another book and so I sat down and wrote that book and I was really had a good habit going with writing so I published that actually just over 90 days later turns out you can write pretty effectively if you write a thousand words a day at what point at what point did you start thinking to yourself okay I have this audience and now I'm gonna start building a product for that audience because you started off at web design and so what point did things begin to pivot into email and just curious more about the tactical ways of actually thinking through that if like I had this audience what kind of product do I build for that audience yeah I actually thought about the opposite and there's a guest post that I wrote for the blog for the guys over at fizzle on fizzled Vaako about because everyone was saying build an audience and then figure out a product for that audience and that was the the conventional the conventional wisdom and now that link is is a recent podcast episode there but I'll dig up later I'll dig up the blog but the guest post that I wrote where I basically make the case that you should do the opposite you should build a product and then use the product to attract the audience cuz then it's actually around the right thing instead of like say you build an audience of 5,000 people who are just interested in following you for a ton of different reasons and then you're like you know if you go that route it will encourage you to build a a generic product because you're you're they have 5,000 people they follow me for a bunch of different things I'm trying to find a product that will cover as many of those people as possible but if I go the other way and I build a really specific product like how to design iPhone applications and then build an audience with that in mind two things happen one the audience is really focused around exactly that product and so guess what that pre-launch email list it's gonna convert pretty well because they signed up with that product in mind let's see that's the first thing and then the second thing is it's easier to build the audience do you want to follow some random app designer or do you want to follow the guy who's writing the book on how to design iPhone apps mm-hmm and so you can borrow this is my beard what I said but you can borrow credibility from your future projects mmm so a second ago I was the design I was like a freelance app developer and then now the moment I put up this landing page I'm now they write the guy writing the book on iPhone app design and so I know one gave me that credibility I just reached out and took it myself because I said this is the project that I'm doing and so that's why I've always advocated for building an audience around the product and not like building the audience first and then trying to find a product for the audience yeah so with convertkit how was the vision behind it because the reason why I like the idea of audience first products is for people who want to be an entrepreneur but don't know the idea and so what the way that the audience helps is you get this kind of feedback loop where what happened for me was I just like was like I know I wanna start a company at some point but I don't know what I want to do and so what ended up happening was I built the audience and at a bunch of different points I was looking for signals that there was something that I could uniquely build and I put out a tweet one time this was in late 2018 it was like in 2019 I want to teach a thousand people to write and I got the tsunami of different people coming at me saying yes yes yes yes yes and then I ended up building rite of passage and for you it seems like it was the opposite how did you actually identify that there was an opportunity to build convertkit and that that was what you were gonna do yeah so the first thing I should say is I want everyone to build an audience I want everyone to things right and build an audience and whichever order you like or whatever the stimulus is or the instigator or anything for for those outcomes to happen is fantastic with me because having an audience is just like the sound I was gonna say it's a cheat code for business 100% is but it's also the cheat code for life like as and I'll give you a quick example then I'll dive into how can working hear about we have her team retreat every winter in Oceanside California bunch of people on my team saying hey we would like a foosball table for this team retreat that's a worthy request foosball tables 300 bucks on Amazon but somebody's got to assemble it somebody's like we're not gonna spend a much time building a foosball table so I threw on Twitter hey who would like who in San Diego would like a foosball table I will buy one have it shipped to your house you assemble it we use it at the team retreat and then you get to own a foosball table after that and I had like ten people saying I didn't want a foosball table but I'll do that for you you know and so there's like these random life things where you can show up in the city and connect with people or all this stuff just because you have an audience and then like that's I'm getting into all the business benefits which are many so the approach was convertkit is another like tried-and-true entrepreneurial approach of like I just built the product that I wanted and you can apply that to writing just as well of like what's the kind of content that you want to read actually that's what I did one defining factor of all of my writing if you go back and look at the blog from say 2012 through now is that you'll find actual numbers in most every post you know made $12,000 on this book launch converts currently had 20 million dollars a year in revenue you know like everywhere you'll find actual numbers because that's the kind of content that I wanted to read and so that that's the scratch your own itch content where I would read so many people's content and it would be you know we did this product launch and it went well I'm going what what is whelming is well a thousand dollars is it twenty thousand dollars like I don't even know and so I've always taken that what do I want to exist in the world and and written that or built it and so that's what convertkit was of me realizing as I built this email list on MailChimp that email marketing was driving more sales and conversions than all the social media channels and then you know I was really surprised by that but then I started getting to okay what are the best practices how do you get more people to opt-in to your list what should you give them and then I thought okay we can build an email tool that incorporates all of that and has the best practices in it by default one of the things that I've learned about building an email list and probably from you at this point just assume that everything I've learned you need like a permanent like hat tip thing at the bottom of my tweets of just like hat tip to Nathan Barry so none of these ideas remind people but one of the things anyhow general idea on the internet yeah so one of the ideas that I really like is that you don't just build an email list like there's not just 17,000 on an email list you actually have 17,000 trust in relationships with people and it is actually all the relationships that you've built year over year that really benefits from or that make building an email less so valuable Nathan what have you learned about building lists and the things that are particularly important we can sort of talk tactically about actually capturing leads but then also how do you actually build those relationships and what does it look like to do that yeah so let's I think let's tackle it from a writing perspective because writing is actually the thing that we're doing and it's the thing that matters and the email list is just the vehicle I say this is the CEO of an email company email is just the best tool and vehicle that we found to connect with those people and the moment we find a better one we'll toss that email and we'll move on to that that better one the thing that matters is the message and what we're trying to communicate so the stories were trying to tell and the concepts that we're trying to teach and so writing is the thing that matters and email just happens to be the best way to get that message in a in a personal way to thousands of people which my mom would be thrilled to hear me say that because she has a degree in English and literature and was always helping us be better writers I was home schooled I remember being 12 or 13 and telling her like mom why do I need to do these writing assignments I'm never going to be a writer like I'm gonna get into computers and design and and like I this is useless what am I ever gonna do with it and then after I wrote like three books she's like I think I think this writing thing that I made you do is worked out okay so I think the things that make you know email us growth work or make writing work are living in this world between teaching and storytelling and so if you think about let me use a video example and I put out a video about this just couple weeks ago with my friend co-worker Charlie Prangley she's a designer from New Zealand to London now she lives in Spain and she does a really good job balancing on her YouTube channel she teaches design and then she also does vlogs and and stories about her life and so what you end up getting is these great tutorials of how to design this thing in figma or whatever tool or she did another great one on like designer salaries and what to expect over the years and things that you would search for right this is kind of I don't care who's putting it out I'm just looking for this content and then she balances it with this is who I am this is my story this is my life Charlie Prangley is her name we'll dig up a link and drop it in charlie marietv on youtube so by having both of these worlds she ends up not only drawing people in but really connecting with them so let's contrast that with like a tutorial site let's say I'm making Photoshop tutorials and I'm putting out the best Photoshop tutorials one after another every week like clockwork because consistency really matters every Tuesday here's the Photoshop tutorial but there's no video there's nothing about me there's no story there's none of that so now it's purely a transaction I teach you about Photoshop and then you I don't know you click on some ads and I make some money or something like that and that's the way a lot of people build build websites and elbonian tsa's and it just doesn't work that well and then so if you have that over on one side then maybe on the other side you could have maybe remember remembers LiveJournal like what are the things you would write on LiveJournal it's just like pouring your soul out onto the page and it's just like this is who I am this is what I'm really you're just it's a hundred percent stories and everything else and it doesn't deliver a lot of value and so people tend to think of writing in either of these two worlds where I I teach or I tell stories in that way and what you want to do is you want to combine those and you want to live in this world where you say this is the content that no one else could have written because I put my new this is the Photoshop tutorial that no one else could have created because I have my information in there you know this is who I am this is my angle and so in those emails that I send out I I include things like this is what I'm up to this is my latest projects like I don't know how many software CEOs there are that are currently building a tiny house while they live on a farm and like that's something that makes me unique so of course I put it into all of my content because I want you to follow me and not just like where to get the best tips on how to build a bootstrap software company because that's generic yeah there's a little rambling but I hope that makes really like I think I want to sort of an anchor that I think that the important thing that you said there was to have it both be personal and where if it's too educational it's just a transaction it then becomes a how-to YouTube video somebody comes on they watch the video they bounce you don't remember the site if it's too personal well it doesn't actually have the value and that gets people from not knowing who you are to then sign up and actually follow your stuff so it's the combination of the education and the personalization that really matters here and I think that that's really important to always think through that sliding scale and also different kinds of articles move along that spectrum in different ways so if it's an email and you're sending an email to somebody who's highly qualified on your list well of course it can be more personal because they've spent some time building a relationship with you whereas if it is a page on your website where you're trying to get lead magnets yeah you want it to be more personal than a Wikipedia article but you probably want to disproportionately provide value to people so that they can say wow this is really helpful so I think that this this sliding scale is something to always think about when writing I've never really thought about that before how would you think about so one of my theses and please if it's wrong tell me or if we can take in a different direction I've sort of been working on this is you know a lot of my students they're like David what should I write about what should my personal brand be and they try to think okay like a corporate brand this is going to be a 10 year strategy and all this but I think that what you're saying here is know you're really interested in the ideas of building authority building an online audience you had this this itch to scratch of audience of content that you weren't seeing and you went out and wrote that but then you that was much more of an intuitive process but then also you're building in things like tiny homes living on a farm running convertkit and I think that rather than having the outside-in idea of what a traditional corporate brand is you have much more of an inside-out bottom-up approach of your writing about yourself and then you're attracting people who are attracted to you rather than zoning out to try to recruit this audience is that right yeah I think that's exactly right and the way you talk about different pieces of content having different roles and different stages the relationship I want hand that's an incredible thing about email is I can actually try to figure out what stage of the relationship we're at based on what I track about each subscriber how long they've been on the list that kind of thing but so if you think about I'm gonna have these pieces of content that are sitting out there on the web that are designed for people who have never interacted with me before like I wrote this article years ago for Smashing Magazine on its head of how to launch anything it's super long like 4,000 words really in-depth you know for a guest post and all that and that has written to people who have never heard anything about me before so it's 90% educational with a bit of my stories woven in but you're not gonna get that same level of personal side because if I had it in there people would be like what the hell why is this guy telling me about his time yet like I don't even care like you know it would be like coming across that post where somebody's just like telling their story I'm like look I'm trying to learn how to install WordPress on a self-hosted server like just tell me how to do that you know and then you have this other content as you draw people in more that brings in that personal side of it because honestly the try thing what a good piece of content would be I did it I do a little bit of vlogging and put some episodes up on my YouTube channel and like I did one that I had a ton of fun with of a family trip to Hawaii and we had a lot of fun with it we did off-roading a bunch of stuff and I'm really enjoyed making the video but that's not gonna attract anyone to my audience or community because people aren't going to go it's not SEO optimized they're not going to do that I'm not a travel blogger that is a piece of content that's all the way on the other end of this for someone who's already been drawn in by some educational hook and then they're a fan of what I'm doing and then they just want to know more about what I'm up to or that kind of thing so if you're thinking that that spectrum and then start thinking about what are these flagship pieces of content that I could put out there you know like I did another one recently on titled the ladders of wealth creation and that's like supposed to be this flagship piece of content that I want everyone to come to for a long time to come and it has some of my stories in it but that's one that I want to hook in a lot of people and then I use different content to like help them get to know me can you talk about the ladders to wealth creation and how it applies from writing your to writing that sounds really interesting yeah it's it's a massive post though I was working on this for a long time he was actually James clear so if you're talking about people that I should just like reference in all of my work there was like a few people like Chris Gill about James clear I don't know Ryan dollar books like that have that permanent asterisk but James and I had been talking about this for a long time and he finally was like dude you have to write this post and so I finally did but it's talking about well here kind of let me just screen share for a second so this is kind of the graphic that I that I put together in it basically having these four different ladders in there of first your trading time for money your other working hourly or salary job then is you can get into your own service business like income could be much higher but also like it's still just hourly work and then you know productize services did like you mentioned earlier like now we're starting to bridge the gap between like a service business and selling products and then as you get in here you know in the products ladder we've got like digital products you know physical products and e-commerce I think are harder than ebooks and courses and as you get into like some of these maybe brands like native or some of these other direction consumer brands like the possible level of success can be way higher the income potential and then you also get up here into like you know I have sass up there and then like marketplaces and social networks so this is as an example everyone comes to me and says like back well back when I did app design people would say like I have this idea it's like Facebook but for whatever and you're like having a hard time explaining to them that they have no experience in business they're currently like over here on the ladder and they're like you know I want to be an entrepreneur and let me pick off the most difficult thing ever so there's a couple of things in this I guess in this example they talk about the post but jumping between ladders is really can often result in a decrease in income that you were and so like as you jump from a salary to running your own company you might make less money at first before you condom water the next thing is that all the lessons that have to be learned in order to successfully run a SAS company or sell digital products like there's so many lessons along the way and if you jump straight from one step say to another you're trying to learn all these lessons on a single step so if you're like I'm just gonna jump right here and cut out five years of the process just know that like you still have to learn all those you're just gonna be grinding it out in one place and kind of the last lesson and going to what you reference davidann on audience is that jumping between ladders is really difficult and so imagine what it would be like is you're going on this journey yourself to have like a hundred people or a thousand or in your case you know 18,000 or 17,000 people who are like in your corner cheering you on helping you to jump between that ladder and that's why an audience is the cheat code for everything because as I'm lying okay say I'm working for a company and I start writing a blog about like starting my own agency and going freelance people are following you for that there's a hundred people my clients are like paying attention to the updates like hey man they're cheering me on hey glad here it's going well I send that another email a night oh yeah I forgot about Nathan we have been a project with them in six months like yeah let's hiring for this next project like I'm staying top of mind and then I come out with a consulting package where I'm going to prioritize services and now his email list for my agency is like five hundred people that I've worked with over time and so I said hey I'm now doing these design consulting packages buy one for a thousand dollars you know and these people are going oh I you know some of them might buy that or they're like you know I don't have a need for that but I know someone else who does and so they refer from there and then kind of the next step is like hey I came out with an e-book on how to design iPhone apps as a hypothetical example and then I had you know now there's 800 people who are saying like oh you know I might want to buy that and so as I'm jumping between ladders and making these really difficult steps there's this ever-growing list of people who are in my corner saying like oh I'll buy that I'll cheer you on I'll give you a testimonial you know I will be this cushion or this bridge and help bring you through it and then as you get into like some much more challenging things like starting a software company where you're gonna lose money for a long time you're gonna have to invest a lot you know for me I had you know at this point you know 5,000 10,000 20,000 people like buying my books and courses and and paying attention to convertkit because of that and so they like you know we're the bridge all the way up the ladder so that's the can you stay on that that that and literally if you're at pop rocks the candy I had just the pop rocks of epiphanies while looking at that so if you could just keep sharing your screen either let's let's dive into this this is amazing now there's a lot of things that I want to talk about here so the first thing is we got a comment about how people talk about career transitions but you don't want to jump to you generally want to jump through one of these from time for money to your own service business and not from time for money to selling products just right away I think that's really interesting I've never quite conceptualized that before the other thing is what an online audience does is rather than making each one it junked it's a bridge so there isn't a big area that you can fall under basically you just walk across the bridge and that's because your audience is actually pulling you so say that you're running a productized consulting business what is happening is your audience is saying you have all of these people like this what happened to me I had too many people who wanted to work with me and so I couldn't meet that demand so I said you know what to make all of you happy I'm gonna build a horse and then once I build a horse and all these people who said I'm out for it and so I knew that the risk for actually developing it read a passage cost me about twenty thousand dollars to create coz we hire a film crew we had to fly them down to Mexico film with them for ten days but the thing was because I was being pulled I knew that the risk on that was very low but now what's really interesting and this is why it was like the pop rocks of Epiphany is then you sort of move up the stack where I'll tell you different things that I'm thinking about ways that I'm being pulled and just like trying to think they're strategically is people always ask me is that are there writers and editors that you can connect me with so we've thought about creating some kind of marketplace moving up the stack is there I thought about making a writing software moving up the stack and so now I have the course which is the easiest part of selling products but now moving up here and I like that it's both a horizontal and vertical graph this ladders of well creation thing is awesome props to you man thanks yeah so the article dives into a lot of stuff because there as you pointed out there's a ton of nuance in it and just realizing you know what ladder you're on and where you want to go there's a lot of incremental steps to it towards it so you did a great job articulating like the kind of that services right I could coach you on how to build your audience and then in there I could prioritize it where I'm just I'm assigning a price to it I'm you know letting you buy maybe just for the checkout form so you don't have to talk to me before you purchase and at each step I'm learning new skills of like okay now my copywriting has to be better because if we were getting on a call my copywriting doesn't have to be good just has to be good enough to get us on a call and then I can sell it live but now if I want you to buy without being on a call like shoot I gotta write some copy that actually convinces you to to fork over whether it's ten dollars or five thousand dollars you know or anywhere in there like that's a whole thing and then as we're developing courses like as you mentioned you know professionally produced course is a tall order like that you know hiring a film crew that's level you want to do it at but maybe there's a bridge in there because say even if we're within digital products maybe you start going productized services and then you say okay let me write the ebook version of it cuz that's not gonna cost me anything so I can write the eBook version of it and you know what maybe I'm not super confident my pricing and it's the first version of the book so I'm gonna price it at $15 I don't know but like now I'm at least making sales and I've crossed that bridge and I'm now on this ladder and then like a little rung up from there it's like okay well let me flush it out let me see what this would look like if I turned it into a full course and I might shoot the first version of that you know just with my webcam and a decent mic and then from there is that's going well it's like okay let's do the third edition of this course and let's fly out the film crew and let's do another launch for it and keep leveling up from there and if you treat it as incremental things in this way then it's just it takes all the fear out of it and well that's not true that does a disservice to life as a creator all like the fear never disappears but it makes it manageable and puts it in those chunks yeah absolutely so at what point did you how have you thought about actually scaling convertkit like actually let's let's sort of just go a little bit this way so with convertkit it's like my interaction with convertkit has been remote you were talking about the designer who lives in Spain I work I have worked with Morgan and she on-boarded me I think she was in Boise like moved to San Diego or something Charlie and and so our most of my interactions with convertkit increasingly have been through writing and so one of my theses is that what remote work is doing is is it is making writing a more important skill how as you think through convertkit where is writing involved I know that you get together either every year a couple times a year for team retreats but I suspect that the flip side of that is you do a lot of writing internally talk about the written word in your company yeah so Jason free talks about how when they do hiring they do a lot of written back and forth a lot of assignments that kind of thing and they value that higher than you know like the interviews because for two reasons one a lot of their internal communication is through written and so it makes sense you're trying to find someone who's a great writer and the other thing that he always says is that someone who's a clear writer is usually a clear thinker and that's what you're looking for is you're looking for people to join your team who think clearly and you're like okay how would I practice being a clear thinker that that's a weird thing how do you I don't I don't know like what do I work out and what way to do that it's like well you write the more you write them like the more clarity you'll get in what you're writing so that's super important for us we communicate in three ways as a company we do slack for all of our like this is what's going on hey I just finished coding this feature we think that's design anything that like ultimately doesn't matter like if you can't find this three months from now that's totally fine but then we use Basecamp for everything that is needs to have a link to it we're trying to make a decision what direction should we go here here's an update on our progress or anything like that because Basecamp lends itself to long-form communication and discussions and so we can link back to that for a long time to come so writing ends up being super important and we have a couple ideas that like core values that come in with that wine is teach everything you know and this is like a philosophy that just applies everywhere because it's like I don't know what I would write about it's like well what did you just learn teach people about that and the other one that we have is work in public cuz it when we're spread all over the globe and we're in there's 47 of us or 48 of us and we're in I think 28 cities so you know we're not meeting in person more often than twice a year and so all that communication is written and it's easy if you don't know what someone's doing to assume that they're like not really doing anything useful you know I don't really know what David does all day like I mean sure he puts out a blog post but like how long did that really take like are we getting as much from him as we're paying for or like that kind of thing and so the easy way to overcome that is to just work in public and to post updates if this is what I'm working on this is what I'm thinking about this is whatever else and and just write that both in slack and Basecamp and so the ability to write clearly and write consistently is huge because that's that's how we work as a company that's the future of remote work Silicon Valley is now catching on the apparently remote work is cool that happened in the last like couple months which is kind of funny and yeah so it's just writing continually and we're also I was going with that but it to answer your question it's very important and its core to everything that we're doing in convertkit absolutely can you talk about you had one of my favorite quotes ever I'm just gonna read it and I'm gonna drop it in the chat and I'm gonna sort of read read from it but it's this quote from an article called good things come to those who write and it says writing is how you get an attention and in today's world attention is the most valuable resource and then you say writers can gather attention better than anybody else and in today's business world attention is the most valuable resource that's why my friends who are writers are the best-paid of anyone I know I think that's really interesting because it's like this very paradoxical thing about writing where if you are a writer and you make money from writing you get paid like a dollar a word it's a really hard life but at the same time using writing in service of something else is exactly what this sentence is leading to that's why my friends were writers are the best-paid of anyone I know can you provide it an example there and and talk about that because I think that it's one of the weird dualities of this craft yes so there's an experience that a lot of my friends have had and I've had a version of it and this is a hypothetical example but I think people could relate is they want to get into blogging or being a creator online is like imagine you know you've graduated from college maybe you went to a really good school like I don't like Stanford so you went to Stanford you graduated you're like a year or two out of school and you go to that family reunion and like that really successful uncle that you have is Darren he's like I kind of punches you in the shoulders like hey man where you have to like Stanford's done like always expecting good things you know oh um you know yeah it's great I'm I'm a writer he's like sorry what yeah I'm a writer like I said Billy it's not audience online and all that he's like ok ok we'll do you need a loan like you know how's the job at Starbucks going like that's kind of the whole perception that it's like you had all this potential like you're probably supposed to become an investment bankers I'm playing and now here you are as a writer and like I don't know I thought you're gonna pick a career that earns a living and that's the perception that's out there and I had this realization while I was sitting in a conference talking to a few friends who they wrote in all these different categories so it wasn't even like they were all in business or entrepreneurship or something um one of him was writing a blog about parenting you know I know there was reading a blog about men's fashion like done in four categories and I realized like I have an uncle who is a doctor in internal medicine probably makes 400 grand a year like he was who I always looked up to from that business side always really good with money all that and I realized my friends who are bloggers who are sitting around all make money more money than my uncle has a doctor whom into school for like 12 years and like suffered through residency and everything else in order to do this and so I'm like okay what is going on in this world where this is even possible and the thing is I realized is it's not that they write because writing is just you know it's hard to even know what writing is worth is it worth a couple of cents a word is it or is it completely priceless because it's the ad campaign that you know it sparks a movement and so realizing that they had this superpower they had this ability that they used writing to get attention and so in the same way that we use email just because not because there's a special about it but just because it's like the platform that has worked best you know for making connection the only reason that we write is because not because there's anything magical about writing it's just that we found that it's the best way to get attention and attention is the bet like just the superpower that once you have attention you can do everything because if you think about all these giant brands they're spending so much money you know the five million dollars for a 30-second superbowl ad all they're trying to do is just get a tiny bit of attention and you're like oh that's all you're trying to do I can get attention all I have to do is write a great story I just have to write a great post I have to teach people things I just have to connect with them yeah things how you get attention and that's the superpower and so sure they can spend a bunch of money to do it I'm just gonna sit down write a thousand words a day absolutely so I'm gonna show all of you this from yesterday so I had a breakfast yesterday and then I was meeting up with Fred at 10:30 and so I got to the coffee shop at 10 and I was like hey I'm 30 minutes to kill I'm gonna just write a thread and I just been talking to an academic who because he's built this online audience now he gets to pursue all of these fringe ideas and ended up getting a grant to write this book and it was because he had the audience so I was like you know what I'm gonna write a threat check this out so what I do is I sit down and I I just write a list of people who should start writing online and I go down and I just come up with nine archetypes of people right and basically write a passage starts next week so obviously I've just been trying to spread the word about rite of passage and this thread just for me sharing ideas I started at 10 17 I did this in 13 or no I did in 30 minutes and then I was being my friend at 10:30 and boom I reached 240 1,000 people because I was waiting at a coffee shop and I needed something to do and then I went down and at the end I just dropped a note here for rite of passage and I got 815 people on the right of path website and this was just an idea at the top of my head that would have been lost a time that then we'll probably once this is I mean it's been just more than 24 hours will probably be seen by more than 250,000 people and I think that basically what's happening right now and this is why Nathan talks about teach everything you know like if you have this system of I come up with an idea that's interesting I write about it online I would have even forgotten about that idea and now it's out there because when there is a moment when you have an epiphany you have to get the words out because an idea on a page will be preserved for so much longer than I did then an idea in your head and so like when Nathan and I say riding online is a superpower this is what we're talking about that idea could have gone from nothing to reaching 250,000 people and I've been doing this for less than three years and i think that what riding online does is you just begin to it's it's this window this portal into a world where you realize that just as a lonely individual you can actually have your ideas be shared it's wild yes I don't I want to build on that because as you can imagine I I believe in that a thousand percent and so like we if we think about okay we want to get 800 people on to the rite of passage website how much do we have to spend in ads and ad dollars to make that happen so this is a not a trap this is a path that I would often find myself thinking down okay so let's make up some numbers maybe we're spending 50 cents a click so I would have spent 400 bucks to get that many people on the website it took 30 minutes to write the the tweet series and all of that so okay I'm currently at a rate of eight hundred dollars an hour it's not bad it's definitely better than the last job that I had so we're in good territory um it's easy to do that math and that math is totally wrong because as we go back to the ladders of wealth creation article one thing that I talked about in there is trading time for money versus building assets so that math is thinking about it still in the trading time for money mindset okay I needed to achieve this outcome I did some work and I achieved the outcome and and that's done that's it but with writing as you pointed out we're not trading time for money we're building assets and so that tweet and those ideas in that tweet are going to continue driving traffic so you can't look at it as the snapshot in time because it's actually an asset that's gonna continue driving traffic to your site not forever cuz it's Twitter but for a meaningful amount of time so the value is going to continue to build up and as you have more of those tweets and pieces of content they're gonna stack on each other so even though the short term math looks amazing that's only just a tiny fraction of it because then that idea that you had like that's going to turn into a long-form blog post and then that's like some of those ideas are gonna turn into books like I always reference James clearer because I got to be a part of his you know around him and friends with him for his whole rise to fame and see so many of these ideas come come about where the one-off idea in a tweet then gets built into the blog post then gets built a new chapter in the book and then the book hasn't left the New York Times bestseller list for 16 weeks in a row you know and you're like okay so we saw a little over a million books I can do the math on how much money that makes because he's turned instead of trading time for money he's turned an idea into an asset it's continue to drive traffic and attention and he's turned that asset into something bigger and continually it's like if in the ladders of wealth creation idea there was the same thing for an idea and how the idea can move its way across ladders and level up from there it's that same idea so when you realize the compounding effects they're possible through writing and sharing and teaching and the way you're talking about it's just absolutely mind-blowing and it might feel like a stretch to get from like random ID on Twitter to several million dollars in book sales but like there's enough people doing that you can see and you win all the way along absolutely so there's this idea in right of passage that we call the content triangle and I'm gonna share my screen and show you what this looks like and so this is very systematized and a big part of my own workflow and how I think about things so basically where what Twitter is for me and what's amazing for all of you is you don't need a big audience for this to work like this actually works in conversation even better than it works on Twitter but it's the same general idea and I needed the scale of Twitter to actually understand that this works in normal conversation that's actually where I play this out and so basically what I do is I run by ideas through as many different filters as possible so I have a little nugget of insight and you could think of writing or even creating a product as something that's really expensive right think of James clear like writing a book it's very expensive in terms of the time that it takes in order to do that so what you want to do is you want to say have an idea come up in conversation you have the two other people they would say ha that's really interesting the idea is interesting stories shared on Twitter the tweet you get somewhat popular then you share it your email and then the email a couple people respond they say wow that's fascinating you write a blog post about it and then what you're doing is you're climbing the ladder that nathan was talking about and you end up with something in a book you will end up with that thing in your horse and it's funny cuz I just wrote this this the sixteen thousand word essay called news in the age of abundance and the there's this idea in there called the paradox of abundance and that whole idea in this video that I shared I literally walked through step by step how I went from a reply hidden on Twitter into actually creating that in in the essay and it then went into like 2,000 words worth of ideas and that's all it is it is like these little seeds just like a garden but then flower up and blossom in all of these unexpected ways that's called like yeah I mean your ability to produce content even outstrips what I was doing when I was writing pretty much full-time so I'm so impressed and yet exactly what you're showing of how to keep refining these ideas and building them up into something is is pretty incredible thank you I appreciate that well I mean this is this is sort of why I wanted to build rite of passage because I have like an information management like an idea management system that sort of enables it all and and and that's what makes it key that I don't or that's what makes it work the key is that I don't really have to remember things in order for this to work and so what rite of passage like I grew up as a terrible writer and I got horrible grades in writing I got laid off at my first job and the overwhelming feedback was like you're not a good writer and it was awful because I just felt horrible about myself and so I had to like develop this system for myself and so of course it sort of looks nothing else nothing like anything else that exists and it's sort of like teaching people who never really learned how to write writing because that's sort of what I had to do for myself so actually in that way I think you and I both relate to mom this isn't helpful to like whoa I'm a writer what I mean that just just shows that well there's an article that I want to write that is bouncing around in my head maybe because I'm thinking about parenting right now because I've got three boys who are eight five and six weeks old and so I'm thinking about like what I want to model for them and and one thing that I'm thinking a lot about is what are the things in life that people's today like oh I can't do that because mm-hmm still like take singing for example you might think that you could pick up a guitar and like if you put enough time you can learn that but like you might have this believe that okay but singing you have to be born with you know and so you're not going to practice I think drawing is another thing there where if you imagine you know what if as a kid you like continued drawing like had this friend in high school she was just an incredible artist and she just was always drawing and she just kept getting better and better and and now she works for Disney as an Imagineer and so I think about okay what are those things where I'm going yeah but I I'm not good at drawing so I don't do that and how could you unlock that and turn that into something where it's like okay that can that's just another thing to learn a language learning I think would be another one I'm not good at languages I can't do that and I think writing is that for a lot of people where they say that that David that's great that you can do that you're a writer I can't like that's not something I was good at as a kid you know I wasn't born with that ability you know or whatever else and so you just have to realize that those are just stories that we tell ourselves when we don't want to put in the work and we don't want to overcome it or maybe we grew up in a way where that mindset was super prevalent and so you'd have to realize that so many people that you think of now as great writers you're like oh man if I could just write on their level that would be incredible and then you like digging a little more like wait what what grades did you get nice : you're in English assignments you've been writing professionally for three years and this is Lola okay okay if I could get to half your level in you know a year's worth of time or three years for the time then I consider myself a great writer and so it's like okay now it's just about putting in a certain amount of work and and I can get there and you can unlock that belief that like I'm not a writer so I can't do it and change into this is just something that comes with practice and with learning and deliberate work absolutely absolutely amen amen to that so I'm going to drop the links to your site in the chat that's naked and very calm and then convertkit where I host my emails this is the convergent website they also just launched a free tier so what you can do if you're just beginning to write what I would recommend is sign up for convertkit so that when your audience grows you don't have to switch platforms I've recommended some other platforms in the past but now that convertkit has this free tier and you can join convertkit when you don't want to pay $50 a month I think that that is a really good place to start so it encouraged you to do that and then if you do want to learn to write write a passage begins on Wednesday and I can tell you there's there's no other community I know of where people come together who are so uniquely intellectually curious supportive and also who love to write there's nothing else like it it starts on Wednesday it's five weeks it's really intense but it's a rite of passage because it changes you and that name is absolutely what it is you will be a different person on the other side so I hope that you join us and Nathan thank you so much yeah thank you having me by everybody
