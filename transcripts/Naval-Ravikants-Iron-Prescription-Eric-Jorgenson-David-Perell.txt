yeah one of the ideas that naval has that i have been grappling with and probably disagree with at this point is that you should really focus on the foundations i think it's rationally true behaviorally false and what i mean by that is he says that you should just study the basics in every field learn those learn those learn those and then only later begin to work up to the other stuff but the fact of the matter is i just don't think that there's a lot of people who can actually follow through on that and i'm not even sure that naval is following through on that as much as he implies with that quote you know he brings up a good line that you mentioned in the book where he talks about all the people who have read biology books but they've never read darwin all the people who are familiar with the latest economics papers but they've never read adam smith that is a good point about the foundational texts but there's something about naval's insistence of focusing on these foundational books which i just don't think are practical ways to learn that somebody's actually going to implement and maybe even himself yeah interesting um i have no way of knowing what's on on naval's uh kindle you know or where he reads and spends his time uh i know that naval like munger is a fan of the iron prescription that like he will tell you the most rigorous thing that you can and should do and if you can do it good for you you'll be a cut above um you don't have to do it not everybody does not everybody will no problem but if you're up for it that's what you should be doing um or or that is the best thing that he can think of to recommend um i think you know you are very right in that like some people it's harder to read darwin than it is to read an article written about darwin like it just is um and sometimes you don't have the willpower or the motivation to get through that fun foundational text um it's hard to you know start at socrates and and work your way all the way back all the way up some translations are garbage you know um but if you look at some of the people who are the most successful you'll see that as a pattern that they have like a deep command of of the fundamentals um you know you see talib going back to like learning languages to read the originals because he doesn't trust the translations um or you know elon musk starting over with rocket science from first principles and formulas to see whether or not you know you can actually just use a missile to get into space um so but tactically i think it is important to understand like it'll take me a year to get through the intelligent investor i just don't want to read the foundational things but i want to learn about investing um and then your choices are you either choose something easier that you'll actually get through and risk not having that fundamental knowledge and being outplayed by somebody who does or you decide that this really is the most important thing for you to study and i'm gonna make it through this thing and it's going to be hard but once i do i'll be much more capable of kind of whatever comes next and you can't do it in every category for every topic and so it forces you to kind of focus and choose where to apply your willpower but and i don't think that's a bad thing
