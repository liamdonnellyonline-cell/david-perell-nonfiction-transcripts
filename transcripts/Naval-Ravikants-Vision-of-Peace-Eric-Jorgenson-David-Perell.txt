you have a line that says creating this book has changed me i feel more clarity confidence and peace through all aspects of life why don't you end the conversation with unpacking that sentence yeah you can't really spend this much time with these ideas and not kind of take them in for better or worse i think and so you kind of have to i'm glad i somewhat carefully chose who to study and which book to write and it's funny you can i can spend too much time thinking about the wealth building section and like stress myself out or i can spend too much time focused on kind of the aspects of happiness and get like really chill and stop accomplishing things um and actually like when i finished editing the happiness section you know um for i think the first or second time i just kind of like shelf the book for a month or two just because i like didn't feel any pressure to work on it or change anything about my situation anymore which was like kind of earned myself a mental vacation it was like deeply peaceful um and then i got a little like antsy again and like started working on it and picked it back up and so you finally kind of you internalize all these things that are like habits of peace and you develop this contentedness and it changes a little bit how how much you try to change the things that are going on around you um which is perfectly fine like you know one of nepal's tweets is like we see ourselves as fixed and the world is malleable but it's mostly that the world is fixed and we are malleable wow so if you learn to kind of adjust your expectations to meet reality nothing bothers you and that's and that's fine um and you're happy and you're at peace if you choose to try to change the world you are all of a sudden what you wish to be true isn't true until you accomplish this thing and that is a tumultuous place to be like that's an uncomfortable it's uncomfortable to hold that desire and to work on that all the time and to decide that you are not going to be happy until this you know what you see as this way that the world needs to be malleable is resolved um and i think the struggle and the core kind of tension of this book is like how do you do both at the same time how do you choose your desires very very carefully how do you choose as few as possible how do you assume responsibility for yourself how do you kind of accept yourself and grow yourself at the same time like that is a tremendous challenge that all of us face every day and to be to fall kind of on either side of that infinitely thin line is is psychologically difficult and emotionally difficult but you can't stay on it you know perfectly all the time and so just learning to understand that that's the vicissitudes of life and that's the scale that we exist on and that we all exist on everybody around us is is going through the same thing of trying to stay on this line um you know some people understanding it and seeing it for what it is more than others some people being far from the line in one way or another at any given time and just accepting all of those things about each other and understanding all those things about each other
