Philip congratulations on your new book writing for software developers I bought it right away and I've really enjoyed it I like how targeted I'd like how targeted it was and you did a really good job just making every single paragraph just provided value there's almost no fluff in the book so congratulations tell me a little bit about the book and what got you to write this thing yeah thanks David um I actually every time I sell a book on gum load I got a notification and what I saw a new email had put just the book I was like yes he's gonna read it so in terms of the process that went into this book I started out writing for clients over a year ago and what happened is actually my boss from my very first technical job reached out to me after a few months of that and he said hey I see you've been writing for some of these places can you teach me how to do that and so we worked out a quick consulting thing and I taught him how to do that and then I realized maybe if he's interested there might be a lot of demand for learning about this stuff started writing the book got the interviews did a bunch of islands of drafting and editing and we can get into all of that and then hit publish and so it's really cool to see that it's gotten the week's that it has and that people like you eating it awesome well why don't we go through the process of how you promoted the book first I think that that's really interesting because you don't have a huge audience you're you're pretty young and you did an incredible job of going on places like indie hackers and going on places like Twitter and then doing interviews as a promotion strategy - do you want to talk about some of those things yeah so the eleven interviews with experts from the field that appeal in the book I didn't illusional II think of that as a promotion strategy I was thinking okay I'm writing this book I have my outline but I know that I've only been doing this for a year and so there are a lot of people out there who have a lot of different perspectives on this really important and broad topic and if I'm going to make a book that's going to be able to live up to a title like writing for software developers which is at the same time niche audience but general in its scope because I've got a couple a lot of aspects of writing to really own title so I went out and I queried a whole bunch of people asking them to if I could interview that for the book and 11 of them said yes which was awesome we did the interviews and then I just kept in contact with these people throughout the writing process I sent them the interview transcripts to approve I said them to contributors copy ahead of launch and I asked them you know hey if if it's possible I would really appreciate some sort of shout out on launch day about this product and you involvement with it and every single person who I interviewed one way or another contributed to the publicity at launch so that was a big facet of it is you know it's kind of hard to not sell books when you have Patrick McKenzie and Daniel Vassallo and people like that writing original Twitter threads about your product the thing is though I had to own that I had to convince them that it was worth investing a small piece of the credibility in advertising this launch and saying that okay I've demonstrated to you throughout this process that I'm making a really high-quality product and you're going to get a positive return on that investment that was half of the launch strategy the other half of the launch strategy was a really effective highly targeted hacker news post and then like you've been talking about posts on these smaller forms as well as a ton of individual emails I don't have a huge mailing list like yours but I have professional contacts from over a year of waiting in writing in the technical industry and so I sent a whole bunch of individualized one-on-one emails to people letting them know about the book probably like 30 or 40 of those nice that's fantastic so why don't we start I really like the sentence that you said about people investing their credibility I think that that's something that a lot of people miss when they ask other people to do promotion for them I mean fundamentally I think that what I'm hearing that you did really well was you did a certain number of things and I want to get super specific about what those things were to prove to them that the product was gonna be really good so yes you did send them an advance copy yes you did do the transcript but there must have been more they would have needed more to really trust you as a first-time author that it was going to be credible and then at the same time I really like what you did with updates that you sent people different updates like hey the the book is complete you can look at a copy now so why don't you talk first about some of the credibility stuff that you did I think that's pretty smart so here's the thing about building up credibility with a busy person is you can't be checking in every day every week even if we month throughout this process because they're just going to be too busy to really engage and respond to the stuff so the main place that I built credibility was in the interview itself and that was by doing a lot of preparation before every interview so like let's take Patrick McKenzie for example he's written a ton he's been writing for almost as long as I've been alive and so I had to go back through this backlog and we'd literally hundreds of his posts in order to come up with questions that I was confident he had never been asked before and I did this for every single person who I interviewed one way out now though I read stuff that's well outside my area of expertise I watched YouTube videos but back issues of people's email newsletters and it helped that I've been familiar with the work of a lot of these people for a long time but I did a ton of research going into every interview and then I crafted interview questions that were very specifically targeted to get new information out of them that I can include in my book that's relevant to the various topics that I wanted to cover in the book itself and also demonstrated to them that I was really invested in bail oak and what they do as a professional and so by doing that I sort of was able to prove to them that if I'm going to put this much time and effort into just this one interview then I'm going to put orders of magnitude more into the product itself and so after a good interview experienced a good one-on-one conversation kind of like what having I think that a a lot of trust can be established in a very short amount of time which is important for demonstrating demonstrating credibility and the follow-up emails even though there might only be two or three of those absolutely talk about how you did your promotion you said that you did a long in-depth post on Hacker News what have you found works well for promotion on Hacker News yeah so I've been a member of the hacker news community for years now and I've just sort of gotten a sense of what sort of stuff is well accepted though what I did is at exactly 8:00 a.m. Central Time I live in a central time in the United States I posted show a chen weiting for software developers which is the title of the block show a chen is really important because this way it goes on a separate tab the show tab and it sticks around therefore in my case a couple days because though a lot fewer show a chen submissions the criteria for that is it has to be a something you made yourself so you can't show each n someone else's product and B it has to be like an actual product or something you know active not just a blog post so by doing that I was able to guarantee that I have a little bit of stickiness from there I also as soon as I post it I went in and I left a comment and the comment said hey hack o news I've been working on this book for a long time because some background here's a quote from the book a quote from the book itself in an interview quote and then I'd really appreciate it if you check it out that comment got people to click into the comment section and would fly to that and that spawned some larger conversations and that got the post all the way up to briefly hitting the top of the front page before going down to the front page throughout the rest of the day and then being on the show tab for a couple days got it so if I were to reverse engineer like why don't we just go out and sort of dive into hacker news for a little bit what you've spent a lot of time on Hacker News what do you think works well on Hacker News how is it different from other platforms you absolutely have to be genuine you can't be salesy at all and you also have to be making something pretty technical foot to be of interest to that audience so I think that it's also you know it's it's a total it's a it's a total toss-up every time just because I had this one success I post stuff on there all the time that goes nowhere it's more about you know it's more about doing everything that you can to get yourself a higher chance of success but you can never guarantee it thinks that increase the chance of success or you know the thing that you're showing off is something that's genuine that you've invested a lot of time and effort in and is legitimately good and useful to busy people another thing is that it's technical you know something lighting for literally any other profession except software developers would not have done newly as well and then the third thing is that you stay engaged with the community you know you in the comments section to answer questions as they come in you know hacker news comments sections can have kind of a negative reputation which is somewhat justified but a lot of people are just there to engage in good faith with your work and the quit assistance that they might offer tend to be legitimate and when they're not you just ignore them don't feed the trolls move on interesting so you talked about show HN what are some of the other tricks on hacker news that would be good to know well that's what makes hacker news so good and what that's what's made it so good for so long is that though won't vary many tricks they have a real moderation team of people at Y Combinator who do a really great job of keeping the community consistent from day to day they have a lot of sophisticated anti-spam ante up vote weighing technology they'll even do things like if you get all your funds to register when new accounts and make comments they'll take you post for that so in terms of tricks you know really if it's a product that you legit we created yourself you can do a show HN if you want to get a discussion started you can do an ask HN and there can be some timing to the posts I think ADM helped because this way you know all the people in in the morning on the East Coast in the afternoon in Europe were able to see it right away I got that little bit of initial engagement and then right when it peaked on half a news a couple hours later was when the West Coast was waking up and that's where a lot of my traffic and sales came from so the timing and these couple little levers that you can pull I think leaving a comment on your own post is also like a trick that helps out sometimes but what makes hacker news so great is that it's kind of a pure thing the best content just wins and did you promote on indie hackers - I did I made a post on indie hackers that took a little bit longer to get to take off it didn't contribute nearly as much traffic hacker news was with about 10,000 clicks that day indie hackers maybe a few hundred but I just posted everywhere you know there's that old expression right like half of your marketing budget is wasted you don't know which half right in my case my marketing budget was time not money I made a bunch of posts on a bunch of different platforms LinkedIn indie hackers producthunt all these all these places where my audience was smaller or the forum itself was smaller and some of them paid off big-time like hacker news and Twitter some of them didn't and what did you do in terms of sales at the first day because let's put some numbers to this it was it was very successful especially for the size of your audience absolutely and tomorrow I'm actually releasing a video on my youtube channel I shall go through the entire analytics with screencast but I can tell you the numbers exactly right here so first day I did 361 sales which is thirteen thousand five hundred and eight dollars of gross revenue in this case the numbers on the day of were just a little high our fastest maybe three or four we funds since then for the rest of the first week the sales dropped off 85 sales the next day thirty one thousand three thousand one hundred and sixty dollars all the way down to you know the after I was at seven sales 252 dollars so the entire first week was just over $20,000 close but still net of we funds and chargebacks which you know you always got a couple of when you're launching at the scale in terms of the conversion rate that got me mail for the first week it was about one in nine people who clicked on the website went in and clicked on the link to go buy it on gum load and then of the people who click to buy it on gum load one in four actually bought it so I was looking at about a three percent overall conversion rate from someone goes to the website to someone actually buys the blog so hundreds of people go to the website three buy the book and since then it's you know that rate has fluctuated massively just because of how little traffic I have like when you have two or three hundred page views on a single day your conversion rate can be you know five times high or five times lower than the day before and that's just you know these fluctuations in the nature of the traffic itself yeah thanks for sharing that so let's talk about the book itself so I read the chapters that didn't have to do with software specifically I read a lot of the chapters about building an audience about for example conversational writing so let's talk about some of those things that aren't necessarily focused on software developers but you know one of the ideas that I really liked in the book that I think about a lot is this is a direct quote when you're writing your first draft don't get stuck just keep writing don't lose momentum you can worry about flow transitions and word choice later and you talked about this right after you talked to Matt Levine and it was funny so Matt Levine is a writer Bloomberg and one of the biggest things that surprised me about spending an afternoon with Matt Levine when he came on my podcast was he writes everything that morning so he basically wakes up and says ah I need to figure this out I need to get writing ASAP and he just freaks out and then he just has to get it done and it's something I think a lot about in my own writing of don't lose the flow and a lot of writing for me is about flow that's why I'm a super notetaker it's why I generally listen to electronic music when I work and basically for me what writing is about is about trying to get as many words on a page in a short amount of time as possible and so I basically separate my writing in terms of new creation right in then in terms of editing and then in terms of what you could call arts at the end and so like my new creation editing is just getting stuff out like I was doing that today I'm working on an essay about the history of work and I'm just trying to just work through different ideas and so I wrote in 90 minutes I wrote I can tell you exactly what I did looking at my sheet now I wrote ok 1113 words I did that and then I also spent about 10 minutes of that 90 minutes just sitting down and doing a drawing to sort of draw things and visualize stuff so I would say a lot of my writing is like that and it's very messy very disorganized and so then what I usually do is I'll take it and I'll organize it to about 70% then I ship it off to my editor and what Kathleen does is she takes it and she sort of organizes it for me and we'll sort of do a ping-pong back and forth to say okay what is it that you want from this what is the main point that you're trying to say sometimes I'll even call her like four big essays and we'll work through it together then she takes it to about an 85 90 and then what I do is I spend time going through her edits which I would say is 5% at the end then what I do is sort of just the art time where generally I do this on like a phone or on my iPad and what I just do is I change different words towards the end it'll change different sentences just to make it sound beautiful and that is 5% but that's the really fun 5% that's sort of when you're putting the icing in the cherry on the top of the cake and I have found that writing yes it's one activity but it's happens in so many different stages yeah that's something that's really important to understand and I'm sure you teach course on writing so you must know this it's kind of difficult to just teach people that that early drafting part directly because it's so individual and everyone does it differently I think that one thing I acknowledge in the book is this book is called writing for software developers but 95% of the time I'm talking about things that aren't directly just writing because the only way you do that is you just sit down and you start drafting and so a lot of the stuff is like we would talk about early Oh getting people in the white mindset to sit down and write something super messy get 70% of the way there and that's pretty much my process as well it's a little different when I'm writing an article for a client because at that point my editor is someone who I want to send something that's complete and finished to I only send something to an editor when I think this is wood for wood how I would be comfortable with it appealing on Dale website and feel like I'm delivering the value that's so that's the slight difference with the technical article process well and and can be the same like if you a journalist for example you know writing a just like a quick peaceful publication I'm sure you know III have no it direct insight on this but I would speculate we're talking about Matt Levine's crazy writing and by the way I I actually did listen to that episode that you did with him I've been leading his work for a long time but after listening to that episode that's what I knew I had to interview him for this book but anyway so if he would ascends seventy percent to an editor with like an hour to go until you until the publication time I doubt that would go over well so there's a difference in format when you're writing something short form I'm thinking you know up to three or four thousand words with a with a publication deadline which is what he and I do all the time him of course much more often and much better and then writing the way that the two of us are talking about with your work and my book well it's a longer more investigative process in that case yeah you have a lot more room for just totally sucking the first time well even the first few times that you try and write about a topic and then innovating building on that I'm also very lucky to have a great editor my mother has an MFA and more years of writing and editing experience than I've been alive and so I was able to have her Willie help me with a strong developmental copy at it kind of like it sounds like Kathleen's doing with your work and then also proofread I think the only place where a process differs materially is that I did a paper proof lead at the end for that sort of out step I don't necessarily like to go in and and fiddle with the exact wording I tend to trust myself in those drafting stages that the things I'm saying are the things I mean in the end but definitely like you go on an iPad I go on paper and that change of medium helps you see the content differently and catch things you might not have caught otherwise and just think more imaginative yeah you said that you spent hours reading Patrick Mackenzie's work what did you learn from him both in reading his work and interviewing him oh so much I mean you know yes if I were to invest that way I would really talk about how much I admire his look then you know I don't think he'd ever talk to me again because he'd be like wow crazy fanboy but I I've learned I've learned a lot from it both in terms of you can you can establish your own style however you want um you know he he writes his sentences just sound different than other people's he has a lot of subordinated clauses if you look at it on a technical level so he's constantly stating something and then stating something in a way that you know weapons is back to the previous thing and so so the grammar can be a little wacky and hard to post but what you're getting from that is a complex idea fully realized in words and when I was interviewing him I was very surprised and impressed that he sounded in person just like he did in writing with a lot of you know I would ask a very specific question like you wrote this thing in 2014 I want you to comment on it and we've got instant recall of the whole situation and a comment that sounds like it was four paragraphs pre-written um so that was really cool in terms of specific things obviously charge more that was definitely running through my head as I decided how to price the book and then thinking about individual engineer's capacity for improving the effectiveness of their work by getting better at marketing it getting better at explaining it to non-technical people and just overall becoming better at communication it's kind of a you know it's kind of a understanding and the software community that know you don't have to be good at business that's what people who are software engineers but I think the best software engineers are good at both absolutely how do you think that so you mentioned the subordinated clause idea what else do you think makes Patric so exceptional I agree about the specific stuff I mean I just think he is the og of online writing for software developers yeah I mean I I think the number of a small number of people who have been doing it since the mid-2000s who have really grown massive reputations Jeff Atwood is another person who I interviewed for the book who's who was operating in the same capacity at the same time and honestly I think it is that length of time and that practice the only stuff does we differently and it gives me a lot of hope that you know I think that right now I do you know a good enough job that my clients are happy and a good enough job to have with a lot of effort and a lot of help created a book that I think is valuable for people to read reading his his early stuff and the early stuff of some of the other people I interviewed gives me a lot of hope that over time you know in 10 years 15 years I'm going to be way way better than I am now and so I think I think that's what makes him and some of these other people so great is just practice they've been doing it for years they've been listening to feedback from the audience and just and feedback from themselves and just getting closer and closer to whatever their idea of what they want to be doing yeah it's funny how much of the Internet is about the 80/20 in that hey what is the 20% of work I can do for 80% of the outcome and that's what so many people focus on and that's actually what a lot of online writing is and the thing is in a winner-take-all world like online blogs where you have a small percentage of online websites that get the vast majority of traffic and what you find is in a winner-take-all market the twenty eighty actually really matters where that last eighty percent of effort for 20 percent of the benefits is then what gets that that barbell to take off and it's something that's I think about a lot because writing is a lot like weightlifting in that if you do CrossFit for example you can go for five weeks and you can learn how to deadlift and you could learn how to benchpress and you can learn how to do a kettlebell swing but at the end of the day you just have to put in your reps you have to put in those rats rats rats rats and if you take somebody like Seth Godin and he's published more than 7,000 articles Tyler Cowen and Fred Wilson have both been writing every day since 2003 and I was texting Morgan Housel this morning who said he's probably published more than 3,000 posts and I said to him Morgan I have no shot at ever writing like you so that's how I feel sometimes and he said write four million more words and and you'll get there and I think that that is part of what it means to do online writing is a craft online writing is a craft of consistency online writing is a craft that rewards people who are prolific and because it rewards people who are prolific it also rewards people who write fast and something that I've learned from Patrick is the way that Patrick tends to write from what I understand is he will sit down on a Saturday morning and just crank something out for six hours and I know trend Griffin does something similar he published a couple million words by writing every single Saturday and then publishing a post for more than five six years I think and what you need to do in order to do that is write fast and that isn't something that most people know how to do and we're all so busy you mentioned that the people who you interviewed were busy the people who are listening to this or busy software developers are busy and once again that raises the returns to being a speedy writer it does and so we've covered a lot of ground to you I want to address a few points individually to expand on your metaphor of white writing is weightlifting I think that it's important to get in the webs but something in the gym is West time and both between sets and then between trips to the gym itself and so in order for me to be able to sit down and just crank out a bunch of words I have to have been thinking about it and been excited about it for a long time in that process of just like sitting there and thinking about it think about it while I'm walking around talking with my friends about it is a really important part of the process for example when I was writing this book I would say that there were about three weeks not three continuous weeks one block of one week and then a block of two weeks why I drafted the majority of the content but that doesn't mean I was you know sitting there like a college student trying to cram in a paper before the deadline I'd been thinking about this stuff and talking about it with people for weeks and weeks and it was just finally time for me to sit down and have those thoughts materialized and that's the only reason I was able to write so fast is because I've had that best time and then I was ready to you know max out on a few sets of chapters so so that's so that's one thing in terms of writing fast it's again like we were talking about earlier about moving those inhibitions toning off whatever you know critic you have and just writing what comes to you as it comes to you but they're also you know specific things you know things that you would think would be beneath the the notice of the conversation like this like typing speed so before I got to college I couldn't touch type and I actually if you're watching the video I only have nine fingers and not all of them are fully formed so my typing style is very different from other people's so one thing I noticed after deliberately loaning unlearning the type of home low typing that wasn't working for me that I was taught in schools we learning something else investing in a good Okinawa keyboard and all that and getting up to you know a more average 6070 words per minute typing speed is that removing the latency between my thoughts and my writing gave a made a huge difference in not only the writing experience itself but how willing I was to sit down and start writing it's also why I never handwrite anything because you know for the same reasons my writing is really really bad and really really slow so even if I'm taking notes or whatever so it's just going to be typed and so writing speed is really important and there can be a lot of factors that go into whether or not you're able to write fast some of them within your control some of them appealing without not within your control but you can actually fix and then some that might legitimately be outside your control and you're just going to have to figure out how to accommodate for hmm how did you pick the writing for software developers niche I mean it sounds like a lot of those limitations would make even coding hard so what made you focus on this yeah I mean I don't I don't feel any limitation in my day-to-day work like I said I just I just had to relearn typing and as soon as I got it figured out there's there's no issues anymore in terms of why I chose writing for software developers well I'm 21 I know enough about exactly one thing so far to write a book about it and that's writing for software developers because I've been doing it for clients for you know 15 months or so as soon as I know enough about a second thing to write a book about it you better believe I'm going to be publishing a book about that thing so so that's you know the topic was chosen out of necessity the other thing is that you know starting out I've read Nathan Bailey's authority and that got me into technical content in general but there was no actual guide that I could find and after doing the research process I found that there were you know a few other books in this field but no real definitive text on deep you know the exact set of topics that my book covers and I was really missing that starting out trying to figure out okay I'm writing for these massive clients my books gonna be seen by tens and thousands of people how do I do this well I had to figure that all out pretty much from scratch and so it seemed natural to me that I would write a book and let other people know how to do it you interviewed people like Jeff Atwood patrick daniel Vassallo what did you learn about the writing process what are some of the similarities that they have that allow them to be so successful one of the things that comes to mind for me is I think a lot about the East Coast versus West Coast I love writing so the East Coast I love writing you could call the New Yorker and it's very literary so you have longer sentences many more commas per sentence and it's flows and it's very artistic in style that's where it's trying to get to it's very influenced by famous novels and it bathes in its complexity actually it's a virtue on the west coast style that emerges out of San Francisco because of software developers they value clarity specificity and short sentences that are easy to categorize very highly and then also naming things because a lot of what software development is is trying to put names to things so that you can categorize things and it's very structured way of thinking and a lot of online writing emerges out of that West Coast style the interestingly enough Patrick is kind of a twist on that you mentioned all of the subordinated clauses he uses most people like a Paul Graham who I would say is like the forefather of Silicon Valley style writing the the patriarch of it I would say his his running is a lot simpler Patrick's is more complex but from the other people who you interviewed is that something that you notice as well yeah there was a broad distribution in writing styles and that's why I wanted to interview all of these different people is to get a bunch of different perspectives I'm from Iowa so I'm sitting right in between those two styles if we think about it geographically but I also got you know I got a great interview with Peter Cooper who lives in a small town in the UK and has you know a very different style from Idol of those that you described he's I mean he's more focused on curation at the moment but but his his style is I guess if we are going to use this dichotomy more westcoast on possibly due to his involvement in software engineering but anyway everyone did have a different style Cassidy Williams had something really interesting to say about this where she talked about over time learning from her experience in developer evangelism figuring out that you have to make your text really not salesy at all and focus just on delivering value which I guess you might consider more of a West Coast attribute but she also talked about figuring out okay I can give myself permission to make jokes be funny you have a personality in this which if you're trying to get a nice rigid structured way of thinking isn't that at all so I think that while we can define these styles and they are a useful thing to think about what makes writing so fun is that over time all of these people having put in these reps and gotten this experience writing over and over again have developed things that are uniquely theirs and are really difficult to replicate even if you go at you know the very detailed craft level and look at sentence diagrams of those sentences for example it's it's not going to necessarily be something that feels natural when you try and do it as well and so that's why stuff like pointing out on paper reading your work out loud that actually was a commonality among a bunch of people who I interviewed was they read their final drafts out loud to make sure it sounds like it's written in dáil voice Matt Levine said that he knew he had it figured out writing online when funds of his that he worked with at Goldman started saying okay I'm reading your stuff and it sounds like it's just an email from you that's when you really haven't figured it out is when your written voice and your spoken voice have sort of converged into one unanimous object that is immediately identifiable as your presence on a page or a podcast or whatever yeah that's well said it's funny I think a lot of what I've noticed is I'll have students in read a passage who time it again before the class starts they'll be emailing me and they will say hey David I don't know if this course is right for me here are three reasons why beautifully structured a nice intro sentence a really brief introduction and then he's very eloquent well-thought-out tomes of why they're on the fence and if they should take the course and I will say I'll often respond and say I would love for you to take the course in part because your writing is already so good and they'll be flattered though so thank you and so often they'll join the course and will start writing online and their writing is awful and what they'll do is they will start thinking about who is the audience they'll have this big amorphous group of people and they'll get stuck David I have writer's block David I don't know how to figure this out and then we'll do an email exchange back and forth goes perfectly and ultimately it's almost like this hero's journey I think that part of what's so interesting about the hero's journey like look at Lord of the Rings right it starts to the Shire it ends in the Shire is that you go through you start in one place you go through an entire journey you leave your home you conduct a challenge you have the resolution you have this whole world of experiences but you basically end up back where you began and a lot of what you're saying there about Matt Levine is precisely that that Matt Levine's challenge as an online writer wasn't to become somebody else it was to figure out how to write online in a way that was right next to where he began now it's not always the same to be fair if there were probably some changes there were probably some advancements there are probably some parts in that hero's journey where he did become a different writer where he became a better more sophisticated author but at the same time it isn't a surprise to me at all that he ended up in a place that was right next to where he started yeah an example of that is one of the things that I wrote early on probably one of the best pieces of writing I did associated with this project that didn't even actually appeal in the book were the cold emails that I sent to my eventual interview subjects asking them for an interview and the reason they were really good is because they were really similar like there were no tricks in these hi first name one sentence based on all of that research that done explaining something very very specific I admired about their work that made me think that they would be able to contribute something unique to this book hi I'm a college student I'm writing a book here's the title here's my availability hint 24/7 for you whenever it works you know I will be there if it's 3:00 a.m. I don't care I want to interview you thanks Philip that's it you know it's a these these emails with four or five sentences and it's really difficult to get there because at the start you know you might that basic email with just the essential information in it and then you think you know I'm about to send this interview sent this interview request to someone who is you know a thousand times cooler and busier and more important than I am how can you know how can it possibly be this base that can get their attention and so you go in and you add a bunch of stuff and you make it sound like someone who so you make it sound different from how you actually sound in real life you build up this whole thing and then you realize wait no way they're actually just gonna weed through all this garbage this is the iliad of an email request and you strip it all back down back to the basics that you started with just the information and you trust that the confidence and presentation and that little hook is going to be enough to get them interested in new project and then of course you compensate with volume for the commotion rates but but but in terms of the emails that woked I think they were some of that some really good early writing that did end up sounding exactly like my normal voice but only after the end of a big journey like that so what let me just read resize this so you're basically saying a good cold email has a one sentence introduction introducing yourself next sentence could be something very specific about what you admired about their writing to show that you're not just a normal person so that could be one or two sentences then exactly what you're asked is so I am willing to I would love to email you or interview you I'd love to go get coffee so that could be part three four parts part four is thank you very much and sign off is that how you would categorize this yeah and the only thing I would add to that very specific ask is you don't want to get caught in an email exchange with details so I would say you know basically this is my schedule over the next two weeks this is like unless I am in class doing these times I will figure out how to get on the phone with you here's my phone number here's the other ways that I can be reached so I wanted it to be you know I send them this email they send me back one email that says okay sounds good I will call you at you know 3:00 p.m. no time on Tuesday and then I send back great thank you looking forward to talking that's the whole conversation you don't want to be caught in the back-and-forth and so providing all that information up front is important yeah excellent I I love that what one thing that I found very early on in my career was that the world rewards young people in ways that you don't really realize often until you're too old to get the benefits of it and unfortunately I actually missed your direct message it ended up in my request tab but I think that had I seen it I definitely would have done this because if you get an email from a college student or somebody who's young who's showing that they're ambitious that they're motivated that they're curious they want to learn and that they're actually working on something the yes rate of that is so high and so the the very interesting paradox that I see here is that young people are the most likely to have impostor syndrome to say oh I don't I'm not deserving of time with that person oh I'm too young oh I'm not smart enough but that belief is more limiting than it would be later in life because of how willing people are to help you and I commend you for realizing that at 21 thank you and I've just fallen off one of those cliffs in that I just graduated from college so I can't email people and say hey I'm a college student the thing is though that can sometimes but it's it's not necessarily one thing on I think it's Patrick Mackenzie's page where he talks about you know a standing invitation to contact him is practice sending email to busy people and say okay the first time you send it say okay I'm a college student here's my ask and then send one to someone else and just don't mention that you a college student because it's not actually necessary so I'd been I had that in mind and I've been phasing it out of my cold out reach over the past few months to practice doing it without that you know extra assistance but just starting out if you are a student if you are young it definitely can increase people's willingness to work with you I mean I've been on the receiving end of a lot of cold email in the past few weeks due to the success of the book I have something on my page that says like hey if you're a student and you can't afford the book email me I'll send you a free copy so I've been getting a lot of email from students asking for free copies and a lot of people write a lot more than is strictly necessary you know they they feel like they have to explain themselves and justify themselves but if they just said hey I'm a student I'd like a free copy I just send it to them since one sentence you'd save yourself a lot of time that way so vocoding and then regarding you a point with people and and impostor syndrome that's definitely an issue and I think it's you know partially the computer science industry has a long way to go in terms of being inclusive to people from all different backgrounds and so sometimes these people can feel even more impostor syndrome which is terrible because you know we everyone wants to help out everyone else in the computer science industry for the most part and so I think that absolutely other college students should look at this example and you know no matter what your background is say hey if I email 100 people 10 of them will get back to me and that could very well change my life well Philip congratulations on the new book it's called writing for software developers I'll put a link in the YouTube description below and thank you so much for your time thanks for having me and this is a fine conversation
