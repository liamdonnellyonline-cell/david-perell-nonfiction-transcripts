preparing for this interview has sparked a lot of really interesting conversations but i think the most interesting one was i called my father and i said why did you name me david and he said that one of the three reasons was that it was jewish enough that it was jewish but it wasn't so jewish that it was obviously jewish and there's something very jewish about mavig your kid in that way in a way that is enough of the tradition that you're part of this sacred lineage of people going all the way back to the time of moses but also something that is subtle and that is discreet because of the oppression that jews have historically faced well there is among jews uh it's not unique to jews but it's certainly significant to jews there is um a self-hatred and self-shame of different degrees that has afflicted jews throughout the generations um and and some jews try very hard to hide it uh there's there's a great story about ben hecht who was a uh he was a screenwriter he was a famous personality in hollywood he wrote a lot of famous movies and when israel was founded he was a very proudly identified jew and he went around to collect money for israel and he went to david o selznick the producer and he said i want you to give money for israel and selznick said i'm sorry i i don't think of myself as jewish and heck said i'll tell you what i want you to pick up the phone and call 10 of your non-jewish friends and say to each of them am i jewish if any of them says no i won't bother you again sells nickelodeon jack because even when jews have tried to hide it the world thinks of them as jewish and so there is a sort of sadness and a quixotic effort to pretend we're not jewish when when everyone knows we are um and and this uh and this i'll be jewish but not too obviously jewish is one way of jews saying i want to be part of the society but without entirely giving up what i am and there that's a struggle that jews have had ever since they've been a minority in a majority culture you could call it jewish yes just so jewish is that something that you see as much in israel as you see in say america or in europe or is it something that happens when jews feel like they're a real minority well something else happens in israel which is not the same phenomenon it's a different phenomenon and that is that a lot of young especially young israelis think of themselves not as jewish but as israeli that israeli is its own characteristic so they're not religious and they think of jewish as the religious part but they are israeli so there is a different kind of identification that goes with being in israel that's not exactly analogous to the way jews have felt in europe or in the united states you wrote in i believe 1995 a nice little book called why be jewish and my favorite line in there was if you wish to know the character of a people look to its heroes how have the heroes of the jewish tradition changed since you started practicing being a rabbi um the biggest change i think i'd say there are two one is that that um i'm not sure that this is since i started practicing as a rabbi but i think in the last hundred years they've changed to a great extent from religious to political um so uh heroes became zionist heroes uh or for jews not so much today the more they know about him but fdr was a hero before that the heroes were generally religious figures not exclusively but generally that's one difference and then the second difference is that um jewish figures to the extent that they succeed in the secular world become jewish heroes so einstein is a jewish hero and and he's a jewish hero because he succeeded outside the jewish world i think that also has changed to some extent although again it was always true a little bit it's much truer now and and i think you would have be very hard-pressed to think since the death of ellie wiesel to maybe sharansky is the only one that i can think of who is a jewish hero a jewish hero who's identified for his judaism um that is accepted by all across the jewish world very very hard to find such a person there used to be a lot of them but now there aren't and i think as i said maybe sharansky is the only one is that something to be worried about to be concerned about because this is something that i struggle with with judaism so i went to hebrew school growing up and i so distinctly remember stories about how you have to knock on the rabbi's door three times and get rejected twice before you can be admitted to the faith and i contrast that with my christian friends who are so explicit about conversion some of them and so for them there's this metric basically like we are successful in so far as we're growing the religion and so when you take a story like that on one hand i'm like that's really concerning maybe jews were losing this faith and i remember a song that we used to sing in in day school it was the the words in english i forgot what the hebrew was it was keep the dream alive and it was sort of like trying to keep the religion alive but at the same time there aren't those conversion rituals so i'm i'm ambivalent here about how to interpret what you just said um well the i mean christianity and judaism are different and and and i think that it's important to to understand the difference in order to understand the the different approaches to conversion um christianity is a religion if you believe in jesus you're christian if the next day you don't believe in jesus you're not judaism is not a religion if tomorrow i tell you that i don't believe in any of that jewish stuff i'm just as jewish as i was today definitionally judaism is a religious tradition that is familial i would say tribal but the word tribal sometimes has negative connotations we're a religious family so you can be born into a family and the only way really to leave a family is to choose a different family but if you run away from home you're still part of the family so if you say i don't believe in the religious traditions you're still jewish um and therefore to join a family as everybody knows who's ever gotten married is a harder thing than to just say well i'm part of a religion because i believe now and for judaism especially because judaism was subject to so many strictures and so much persecution and so much difficulty he wanted to make sure that somebody really wanted to be a part of you before you said okay you should be a part of us because the one thing that you didn't want was people who came into judaism easily and then said oh you know what then forget this because according to jewish law once you're jewish you're jewish that's it you can't leave um even if you convert in theory in theory you're still according to jewish law jewish so jews made it hard and also they didn't always trust people who converted because some of the people who converted were spying on them and that's why they converted it now for the most part though the attitude towards conversion in the jewish tradition was very very positive and jews welcomed those who wanted to convert i don't practice the the discouraging people twice and most modern rabbis at least most modern non-orthodox rabbis don't and even orthodox rabbis don't the same way they used to because the world is very different from what it was for most of jewish history and when someone comes and wants to convert to judaism the assumption is not that they're going to find it you know a religion that is persecuted and driven and difficult and so on um having said that it does require a different kind of attitude towards conversion from christianity because of the different kinds of bonds that you jews feel for one another yeah there's something embedded in what you just said that i think is a fascinating not that i've been trying to entangle within the jewish tradition and it goes something like this the bible is a perfect text but it is up to the rabbis to interpret the bible and the interpretations can change over time give me a story of a way that our interpretation has changed and explained to me how you can have a static text a different interpretation of it and have both of them be the word of adonai god well let me start with the end of the question before i give you an example the way you can have a text mean most things is because god's word is infinitely meaningful that unlike human beings who can only say things with a limited meaning god can say things that is endlessly unpackable so to speak and so there's no reason on earth why we should think that god says something that only means one thing um and how have interpretations change there are so many i'll give you uh i'll give you an example um that is uh a painful one and a powerful one um so uh suicide is against jewish law but the rabbis decided that that means that if somebody meant it and did it compass mentis that is they were fully aware of what they were doing so generally when someone commits suicide we say obviously the fact they committed suicide means that they were not fully in possession of their fact they were depressed or life had dealt them all sorts of blows and they were so that is an an easy and understandable way of getting out of a tragic situation that wouldn't allow somebody for example to be buried in a jewish cemetery that now they can be um and and if you ask yourself did god mean that well the assumption of the tradition is god meant it there or it wouldn't be part of the tradition um that's a painful one uh a less a less explicable one in some ways but also is three times in the bible that says you shouldn't see the lamb in its mother's milk it never says that you can't eat a cheeseburger but the idea that the rabbis took was it wouldn't say it three times unless it was emphasizing that there really has to be a distinction between milk which represents life and meat which represents death so there are people who not only have different dishes and different silverware but different dishwashers for milk and meat and take great pains to make sure that milk and meat are separated did god intend you not to eat a cheeseburger well according to the very strict literalist of the tradition that's exactly what god meant but obviously to someone who is not a literalist this is the tradition creating a way of life out of the words in the torah so i'll let your listeners decide um i remember when i was going through my bar mitzvah training one of the most just like jarring realizations was that the role of a rabbi is to be with people in the times of their life that are the most meaningful birth marriage death and then a bar mitzvah uh transferring to adulthood is there one for you that has been a practice that has been particularly filled with wisdom and what have you learned from it um i think that the jewish traditions of mourning are extraordinarily powerful and i see again and again how much they mean to people um so uh i think that what i learned from it if i can put it in these words is that the only way to live is by a certain betrayal of the memory of those who died and i say betrayal not because it's really a betrayal but because that like shocks us to the awareness of what it really means when someone dies that you're really close to you think i never want to i never want to enjoy life again um i never want to sit down to a nice meal i never want to because i've lost this person who meant everything to me and yet you have to and judaism the first thing you're supposed to do when you come back from the from the cemetery is to have a meal and the process of shiva where people come even though you don't want to see them and it's like i can't believe that all these people are invading my house the process of shiva is a way of yanking you back into life precisely because you don't want to be yanked back into life and you feel like it's a betrayal to be yanked back into life and yet it is essential and it is the only thing that allows life to continue is that and and by the way according and there's a gradation of mourning there's seven days of shiva there's 30 days of something called sloshing and then there's uh 11 months for a parent which is the longest period of morning so basically a year and um and then you have to stop you're not allowed to keep saying the prayers of mourning after 11 months you're not allowed to and the reason you're not allowed to is that that is a betrayal of life and of the fact that god has still chosen to allow you to live and therefore you have to take advantage of that and i think that there is almost everyone that i have witnessed to go through this process is astonished at how powerful it is and what deep wisdom it holds so um i would say more than anything else again and again and again as a rabbi that has impressed me by its its depth and its meaning yeah unfortunately one of the things that i think living in cities does is it takes us away from the supernatural and i've only had a couple moments that i have wanted to be more engaged with with my own faith and one of them was when my dad's brother died he died quite young and his burial it was bizarre because he's usually has so much composure and same with a lot of people in the family and i was watching i think was the first time i ever saw my dad cry and what i really appreciated about that day was the structure and the tradition and the sturdiness of the jewish faith actually allowed us to soak into the pain of that moment but in a good way soak into the grief because we didn't have to be in control the faith was in control it sort of acted as guard rails so that we could just be there and watch the grave go into the ground i think that's beautifully said um it's that's why more than any other time people ask me at funerals what am i supposed to do because at a time of meaninglessness and chaos which is what death is um we all want the structure that allows us to say okay now i do this now i do this now i do this um and and that's a deeply human reaction to to gazing into the abyss is that you want to hold on and as you said you want to have guard rails yeah moving on to something a little lighter i think that one of the things that i got by just spending the last couple weeks absorbed in your work through podcasts or videos through books is this constant reminder of the wisdom of the immaterial world you know i think that after marx i think that marx and a lot of his contemporaries they were very materialist in nature and i think that a lot of science it has has a lot of those materialistic qualities and i feel like one of the implicit messages of judaism of tradition of your work too is to listen to the echoes of the abstract and that there's wisdom and things that we can't that aren't quite tangible but they are still real i think that first of all thank you i think that's exactly right and i do also do believe that there is a um one of the reasons i think why jews for example flocked flocked i don't know flock many went to buddhism was because they were so taken by modernity not so much by judaism but by modernity that they were overwhelmed with the idea of only the tangible is real um and and what you said about marx is true it's why it's called dialectical materialism right it's the stuff of the world that matters and increasingly i think especially as you get older you discover that's not true even i've said many times you know i know a lot more than i knew 30 years ago in information but also just in what i would say is wisdom but if you say to me what do you know about life that you didn't know 30 years ago i don't think that i can articulate it i don't think i can say i know this but i know it and it's inexpressible ineffable as you say intangible but it's real it is real and that's true of so much of what we live on every single day that it's in some ways a marvel to me that people can really believe that the only thing that matters is stuff um when that's clearly not the case in our own lives it's not the case in our relationships with each other and uh and i don't think that it's uh it's the case in the world yeah so maybe you can sort of help me navigate this this this question that i've been really struggling with so i think that on one hand to have the wisdom of science and what it's given us is this march towards understanding more and more of the world and i think that there's might be some kind of stubborn attachment to we can understand everything that is driving a lot of this process that is the sort of religious belief that might drive the ambitions to learn about the world but at the same there's this weird correlation between what i would consider and i think this is a fairly controversial belief but maybe not what i would consider the rise of science and the decline of art i think that as science begins to continue and we stop making art for god or for some transcendent power it has become much less beautiful and so i'm struggling here between like wanting to understand and explain as much as the of the world that i can but at the same time having this humility that the world is so grand and expansive that it's beyond my grasp it is true certainly that we have these com sometimes competing sometimes complementary drives one is to be overwhelmed and the other is to and and also to manipulate which is part of what the drive to science is not just understand but it's to manipulate to create the world in a way that we can control it um for for reasons good and bad um not only for bad but for a lot of good reasons i mean technology you know medicine all those things um but the creation of art is as you say in some sense even though the artist may not be humble the creation of art is a is an act of humility it's here is an expression of something greater that comes through me and so yeah i think that that's true that um it is in in a technological age there are profound effects on the idea of art and that's one of the reasons why you know art has become where art used to be a public medium i mean art didn't start off in museums you know the whole idea of having museums which the romans didn't have museums they had statues on the streets which is where art is supposed to be because art is part of the atmosphere of living but once it becomes in museums and wants poetry for example to take an easy example there was time when poetry was something that everyone recited it was easily understood it rhymed it had rhythm and so on now poetry is a specialized pursuit and and only certain people read poetry and when you do it's not easy to understand and it has to be explained so it becomes more and more and more recognized and more and more and more specialized um and more and more and more abstract as you say and less a part of the common currency of life and so the only art right now that's really part of the common currency of is uh mass media is movies television which can be you know works of art i think there's no question that you can achieve art on a screen as well um but it's still it's much harder that's one of the reasons why we don't have a common culture the way we're used to it's much harder though to get art that everybody is a part of and and i think that yes science has some part to play in that but so do certain social developments have a part to play in that maybe by the way also to some extent i suppose writing some novels um strike a larger chord but even there there was a time when everyone when when a book came out and everyone had to read it that doesn't exist anymore not certainly not for fiction um but there were you know there were not so long ago in american history there were certain novels that when they came out everybody had to read them not now you know one of the things i've been thinking a lot about is aloneness and there's two things that come to mind one is a line from deuteronomy another is a ritual that we have and when you're at synagogues and you do your silent prayer you can stand for as long as you want and there's always one person who every week stands there for as long as possible and every synagogue has one and you don't say anything to them and there's a line in deuteronomy that says it is not because you are the most numerous of peoples that i have set my heart upon you and treasured you indeed you are the fewest and those two i think are this frame around the jewish faith well let's start with aloneness first of all this is the first thing that's called not good in the bible at the very beginning of the story of adam and eve god says it's not good for a person to be alone so aloneness is a is a human uh dilemma and togetherness is a human need and i've thought of that line many many times during the pandemic for obvious reasons um it is uh it's a real trial and it's and as you as you know it is everybody who's listening knows mental health experts will tell you that rates of depression are up and and uh various mental diseases have been triggered or re-triggered by this because you need other people and and the paradox in in judaism isn't so much the aloneness of the individual and the people because you have to have a minion you have to have 10 people to say many of the prayers and most ritual practices in many many to most ritual practices and judaism presume other people there but the people itself is called a people that dwells alone uh and and what has happened throughout most of jewish history is that jews were isolated and part of the reason why they developed these very powerful bonds with one another was because the outside world didn't want them um and when the outside world would accept them it would only be on the terms that you're no longer practicing as jews this is one of the things by the way that that however however you feel about america and and i know that this is a complicated subject especially at the moment um jews have enormous reason to be grateful to this country because it never said in order to be accepted here you have to cease being jews and that was our experience almost everywhere either explicitly or implicitly and so it said you don't you can be part of the polity and still be who you are which is why we didn't have to be alone here as a people to be part of america and that's what makes this um moment so uh complicated for for jews um and uh but the but the single individual i think that that's just uh a syndrome of certain individuals as opposed to a reflection of the jewish tradition that's my take on it yeah i've been thinking a lot about yom kippur and i like that judaism so there's humility is really hard um and it's hard to tell other people that you have wronged them when it's just kind of comes out of the blue but every year growing up we used to go to the water we used to take breadcrumbs and we used to throw them into the the lake as a symbol of basically repenting for the sins that we've done wrong talk about that tradition talk about yom kippur and this year what it symbolized to you and then i want to get into the jewish verses christian interpretations of sin in a little while so uh the the ceremony you're talking about which is called poshlife is a representative casting off of your sins and and the the sins of uh in jewish tradition are there of two kinds they're individual sins and they're corporate sins that is you confess not only to what you have done but also confess on behalf of the jewish people and that's why you don't gigantas has really done alone it's almost always done with other people and the intent of it is to say i know that i don't live in isolation and when sins are done i'm implicated in the sins of my society and the sins of my group and the sins of my uh you know of my and so you cast spread into the water in in the hope that you will be able to sort of cast your sins off in the same way and and make that an internal cleansing by a symbolic ritual action that's the hope that i will it will be cathartic and i will feel as though i didn't lose i didn't lose this opportunity to purge myself of both my sin and the sins of my people now i should say there is a confessional in every morning service so it's not like you only do it once a year and the reason that that's so is because the assumption is you're going to sin every day um which i think is probably a pretty safe assumption yeah well that's i think leads into a lot of the similarities and differences between judaism and christianity so let me give you my interpretation of it you can tell me where i'm right where i'm wrong so judaism does not look at every human being as automatically sinful in a way that christianity does christianity says you are gonna sin you have sinned and judaism it seems like sin is i want to say more of a choice but there's probably a more precise way of putting that so now we're speaking about classical okay classical christianity based on augustine who won this argument with pelagius who didn't feel this way um augustine said we are born in sin it's called original sin um ever since adam ate the fruit wasn't an apple by the way but that's a separate question ever since adam ate the fruit um human beings are essentially sinful and therefore it is only by the sacrifice of jesus by an act of grace that we are permitted to have salvation it's one an analogy that i once used in a class about uh about this is it's like you're in a 300 foot hole it doesn't matter how high you jump you can never get out someone has to come down and get you and bring you out and that's the function of jesus judaism doesn't see human beings that way in fact every single morning in the morning prayer we say a phrase that says which means god the soul you have given me is pure now i have no doubt although i haven't done research on this but i have no doubt that that line was put in there specifically to say we don't believe in original sin instead in judaism we believe in what i would call original splitness you'll have good and evil inclination in and no human being manages to make it through life much less not even a day without some evil inclination some sins some i mean i i love the story of of heschel where heschel was a great jewish theologian and he was once talking to someone who and he said that he said i'm going to synagogue and the guy said i don't have to go to synagogue because after all i'm a good person i'm like i don't hurt people i'm nice and heschel said oh i envy you ashley said i'm always saying the wrong thing i'm always not saying the thing that i should have said i'm always inadvertently wounding people you i really envy you you must be so special now of course ashley knew quite well that he was at least as good as this person was but the point is heschel had much greater ethical sensitivity and he took things that this other guy thought no big deal as serious so if you think about it that way every single day goes by when we say things in your education or or um we're unkind or we don't reach out when we could and therefore it's not like judaism believes that people aren't sinful but it's not in your it's not encoded in your dna it is a product of your actions not your nature and so you really can do repentance and you really can't change who you are it's not an instant process that all of a sudden you are saved rather it is a daily um you know at every moment says maimonides the greatest jewish philosopher and legalist at every moment someone should see themselves as perfectly balanced between good and evil so what you do now will tip that scale yeah as you were talking i pulled up the soldier and it's unquote the line separating good and evil passes not through states not through classes nor through political parties either but right through every human heart exactly what is it about marmody's that made him so great yeah what made my monetary so great yeah um so maimonides was maimonides was born in spain and he was born during a time of an almighty persecution of muslim persecution um his family fled to cairo where by the way also uh muslims were but a much more tolerant islam uh was uh was ruling actually to a place called fostav which is a sort of suburb of cairo and maimonides grew up to be the greatest physician of his age he treated the sultan but also the greatest legal authority in jewish history and the greatest philosopher in jewish history um so he was a titanic figure in the middle ages uh and took from arabic philosophy and he wrote his by the way his philosophical works in arabic because that was the language of philosophy uh in the middle ages which people don't always know um and also influence not some arab philosophers but especially um thomas aquinas and and the christian church uh and his great task as a philosopher was to try to reconcile greek wisdom with jewish philosophy that was because greek wisdom was the philosophical wisdom of the time aristotle plato especially aristotle um but also maimonides tried to create a law code that jews could read so that they didn't all because he knew they wouldn't study the intricacies of the talmud they could just open it up and find out what to do his law code is extremely influential to this day but of course as happens over hundreds of years people disagreed with this took issue with that other scholars argued with him so there's commentary upon commentary upon commentary it never ever ends as just like it doesn't in any other field uh but uh but maimonides was a uh an extraordinary landmark so much so by the way that if you go to the city of cordova now they have a statue of maimonides in that city uh where he was and uh he was some he was especially considering the very difficult conditions of his life it's almost inconceivable what one man accomplished when you were talking about heschel earlier were you talking about heschel who wrote the sabbath yes i know you love that book how come i do um heschel was a uh he grew up in eastern europe he left right before the angelus right before the nazis invaded poland he was saved sort of by the skin of his teeth by an invitation to come teach in and uh and he had a very um he had a mystical side and he wrote a beautiful short book very short you can read it in an hour um and i suggest that you do called the sabbath where he said that jews built jews i the jews were always wondering they did not build giant cathedrals instead he said they had a cathedral in time and that's what the sabbath is it's a cathedral in time because there is an essential deception he said to technology which is it collapses space and therefore we think it collapses time because i can see people on the other side of the world i forget that i still have the same amount of time in my life and that wasting an hour is wasting an hour whether i do it you know by watching people in in calcutta or by watching uh my cat play on the couch and so uh the sabbath is this pause in time where you get to actually appreciate the fact that um there is rest in the world and you're not always driven by what you have to do next and what you have to achieve and and what you have to accomplish but you can just be um now having said that i have not begun like any masterpiece i have not begun to do justice to the beauty of the sentences and the the richness of the insights of the books so i urge your listeners to get on amazon or wherever they buy their books and order abraham joshua heschel's the sabbath uh i don't think you'll regret it that's a beautiful idea the way that by collapsing space you also collapse time and certainly seems true i mean it if i were to describe what technology has done to time is it's we keep inventing things to save us time and as we do we feel like we have less yes yeah i mean one of one of the i find one of the disorienting and but probably helpful features of the technology that we all share is every now and then the iphone will tell me how many hours i spent on it every day too many and it's not good it is not good you know uh and the other part of it is um that the the immediate the urgent drives out the important and so i can be sitting and and studying something or reading something that's really deep and profound and then my phone lights up um and i feel like i have to look at even though the truth is um there's a wonderful analogy that i i uh i try to keep in mind and i like it's not a jewish teaching but uh it could be um i really i think i first saw it since years ago in stephen covey's book the seven habits of highly effective but he quote some professor who went in front of his class and and if it's not in that book forgive me but i think it was he quotes a professor goes in front of his class and he takes a glass and he puts three big big rocks in the glass and he says to the classes the glass full and they all say yes and he goes no no no it's not he pours gravel over the rocks he goes now is it full and they go well now it's full he says no it's not and he pours water over the gravel he says now if i had poured the water first i would never have been able to put in the big rocks if you start he says with the little things you never have time for the big ones but if you do the rocks first you will always have time to gravel in the water and i try to remember that in the morning when i'm studying or writing i try to think i will answer all the emails i know i will but if i answer all the emails i will not go back and for the writing and the study so you gotta do the big rocks knowing i promise you that you will have time to put in the gravel in the water but that's a hard discipline to stick to because technology tries to make the gravel in the water increasingly attractive and the rocks take work that's beautifully said i mean it's hard to really sit and study things because it's not just i mean even if you take reading like different kinds of things that i would call rocks the internet has this way of i love what you said it drives out they're urgent and gives you or drives out the important and it gives you the urgent and even with reading you know it it gives you the new the novel the recent and there's like this certain class of ideas and i really struggle with this where they're things that later in my life if i wasn't studying them every day now i would severely regret them yet every time i sit down to read them it's not the highest leverage thing i could be doing right now yeah i i tell people whenever somebody says you have to read this i say no i don't there is no such thing as something you have to read unless you want to say you have to read this it's anna karenina or it's war and peace but if it's the latest post from cnn or it's an opinion piece in the new york times i might want to read it i'm sure it'd be interesting it might be illuminating but believe me in a year you won't remember that you read it maybe in six months maybe in a week maybe in a day and so every time someone says oh this you have to see i always my immediate reaction inside my head is no i don't and i never say so i never send something to someone and say you have to read this um because i know that that's just not and we again we so um saturate ourselves with this with ephemera that we have lost uh to some extent the ability to pay attention to things that really matter and one of the ways by the way that i suggest you do this um i know by saying i suggest you do this it's one of the ways i do it okay it may not work for you i take walks early in the morning and i listen to books on tape and i put my phone in my pocket and i turn my notifications off so i have no idea if someone's texting me or they're not texting me i'm just listening to the book and until i'm done with the walk i don't look at my phone i'm just walking in the morning listening to the book um and amazingly i have done this now on and off for years and years and years and guess what i never got a text that said you know you won a million dollars on the nobel prize if you react within three seconds every text i ever got it was okay that i answered it once i got back to the house so i'm telling you it's actually possible to do it's not easy but it's possible to do you just have to get in the habit of doing it and and also you have to educate the people around you it's usually just a few people right who always expect an automatic answer that at certain times of the day or for certain reasons you might not answer immediately and and that's because you're doing something else and you're allowed to do something else you're a person before there were these phones we didn't expect this that someone would always be at your beck and call night and day this is a new thing yeah you know we're talking about space and time earlier and there's been another effective technology that judaism tries to push against and i think a lot of religions and it is temporality and the way that seasons take the day and they stretch daylight like an accordion during the summer and collapse it during the winter and what we have in judaism is a year and every week there's a torah portion that you continually read and you go around in that cycle you spin around it and it restores the reality of different types of year whereas if you are just scrolling your twitter feed and you're just looking at the clock and you have lights to illuminate your room and you have air conditioning the time of year doesn't actually matter all that we are very much it's you said earlier in the in the podcast that um because you live in a city you are disconnected sometimes from the transcendent and it's true when you walk out at night you don't see stars you see the lights of the city or if you do see stars it's not like you see stars in a natural environment buildings are everywhere around us i live in la and so the cycle of nature is also we are protected from it i mean it's still it still matters it still exists obviously especially in places where there is a real cycle not so much in l.a but on the east coast when winter comes when snow comes it's real but yeah we have done everything we can to create an artificial environment uh that detaches us there was a swiss writer named max frisch and he said technology is the knack of arranging the world so you don't have to experience it and there is something to that we try not to experience the world because we want to be comfortable and safe but uh but there is also there is a counter movement to that you know people who go to things like burning man um they do that i think in part because they want to to feel the earth beneath your feet is an important spiritual uh spiritual undertaking yeah there's a word that you've used re-enchantedness that you need to find this beauty in something over and over again talk about that idea so um i said in one of my sermons i quoted john burroughs who was a naturalist who said if you want to see something new take the same walk you took yesterday everything changes you change the world changes and sometimes in very subtle ways but you can rediscover things infinitely just like you can rediscover people infinitely none of us are the same that we were as we were yesterday and all of us have more sides than we have than a lifetime gives us the opportunity to uncover so you can rediscover reinvent re-enchant um the idea that anything is exhausted is probably untrue uh the world is infinitely rich and the question is less um the question is less whether you've um whether you're bored of something than whether what it is you're investing in is worth your time because if it's worth your time then it's inexhaustible in the same way that you could spend your entire life investigating one field of science or one or one or a couple of books or one episode of history or i mean everything is is um has endless ramifications and so the idea of re-enchantment is in part to discover anew how miraculous and wondrous the world really is which doesn't require in the world it just requires different eyes hmm what have you seen among so they're sort of being re-enchanted and then there's the spark of enchantment what have you found in common among conversion moments what conversion moments what brings people to the faith and what sparks that first enchantment i think i'm not sure that i know of a common denominator it can be very very different things um and and i'm going to sort of cop out by saying the common denominator is something that speaks deeply to that particular soul and for some it's a relationship and for some it's an intellectual discovery and for some it's an artistic discovery for some it's a moment of travel um i don't know that there's any single thing that ties them all together other than this is the thing that did it for you you know so i was getting my hair cut about a year ago and it was right before easter weekend and my barber had three kids and he was talking about what he was going to do for easter weekend and he said oh we're gonna go to church we're gonna take the whole family we're gonna go to church and i gotta raise the kids religiously and so i said are you religious and he said i never go to church and i thought it was funny that and i know a lot of people like this who insist on raising their kids religiously and yeah i may even do the same and yet people like me people like many others aren't actually very active in practicing their own faith what's going on there um i think that people feel as though this is something that children should know something about and should have some experience of um and then i mean because the truth is if you don't give them experience of it then there's no chance that they will have have any understanding of what it is that religion is about the only chance that they have of understanding it is if you give them some grounding it's like a language you'll never speak it quite the same way if you're only introduced to it as an adult and so it's an opportunity that parents give their children to how you can discard it later on but it's much harder to pick it up um so i really i mean i wrote a book called teaching your children about god i think it's a great experience for both parents and children to explore religious traditions together and brings them closer and teaches them a lot about each other and and about themselves who have you studied in terms of in terms of giving servants i mean i think that one of the things that you do particularly well is you draw from a a world of basically one minute stories that you have saved yeah i i don't i mean in some ways i don't have a good memory there are a lot of things i don't remember i can read a book and i will forget weeks later what the plot was who the characters were but i'll remember two lines from it and they'll stick with me my whole life i have like i don't know a weird kind of rolodex in my head so i have quotes and stories that are endless and i clearly got this from my father who was the same he had a better memory in general but he a lot of my stories are from him he was a rap i was a wonderful wonderful speaker and i grew up listening to him and i think there's no question that anyone else comes far second in terms of influencing me and how i spoke and how i learned and how i uh how i think about things and so it's uh it's a great gift because in what i do the story tends to be more lasting in people's minds than the uh than the idea or then the argument so we are we are all both storytellers and story consumers i mean if you think about it everything you watch on netflix and amazon prime and everything you discuss with your friends about what's happening with their friends and everything you know about your family they're all stories we live in this constant web of every book you read fiction or non-fiction they're still filled with stories very few people read a statistics book and even statistics tell a story if they're attached to anything in the world um stories are just the the uh the fabric of every life and so if you remember stories and you tell stories um you can influence people in a way that i think nothing else can what did your dad do so well with storytelling um he had a story for almost every occasion and [Music] i learned from him how to draw from not only jewish sources but culture art music almost everything and i was lucky enough to grow up in a home filled with books and where he was always reading and my mother read a good deal too though not like my father um and so i was the same i just grew up devouring books and uh i'm proud to say that my daughter does the same and i i mean i just uh i'm always ordering books and i'm filled with books i mean i look around my shelves and i think oh my god i want to read that or i want to reread that or i need more time i haven't had a chance to read that and and it's been sitting there and it's like i i the um the head of uh of the public radio station here ruth seymour used to be the head kcrw um she said that she had next to her bed the shelf of constant reproach like all these books that were looking at her and said i haven't gotten to me yet and i feel as though i believe in a house of constant reproach all these books saying listen i'll wait for you don't get me wrong when you open me i will still be here okay i will be very patient but i've been here for a long time already you know you should open me and read me already and and the amazing thing is um i don't know if other people have this experience i'm sure some people do i there are books that have been on my shelf for so long that in some ways they i almost don't see them because they've been there for so long in the same place and yet something i read a review or i'll i'll something will strike me and i will read them and then it's almost as if it reminds me of the kid who used to sit at the back of the class and the whole semester they wouldn't say anything and then they would open their mouth and you would go oh my god what a smart kid i never knew right um there are books that have wonderful stuff in them but i just never got to them and i'm so glad that i did before i can't get the books anymore yeah you know it's funny we're talking about storytelling but there's a particular kind of larry david dry humor that is all over the jewish tradition what's going on there yeah that is a great question i think that partly this is how jews dealt with difficulty uh was that humor i've never been able to find this quote though i've quoted it many times but i i once heard that nietzsche said that wit closes the coffin on an emotion in other words you're feeling something and it's painful and you don't want to feel it so you make a joke about it and it makes it go away and i think that that's how jews dealt with a lot of painful emotions is they made it funny um you know i the the larry david is a really good example here he's in all these situations that are really painful situations in lots of ways but they're funny so you don't feel the pain of them and and there is no question that that and also it is a lied to and in this i think we're like some other uh ethnic groups i think of the irish for example allied to a certain verbal dexterity which i think comes to the jews in part because we wandered and we have to learn so many languages in wandering but also because we are tradition of words the bible the talmud i mean judaism is is a web of words that's what it is so uh if you're verbally dexterous then then humor is likely to find its way in there as well and uh put all that together and you get a long line of uh of jewish comedians this word thing is interesting i want to sort of follow that a little how is beautiful jewish writing different in hebrew versus english i i don't want to say it's deeper it's different first of all it's hard to say which books in english are jewish is saul bellows book jewish i think it but i'm not sure that every jewish writer writes jewish books but i would say this is how i think of it maurice samuel who was a writer and translator he said the reason the jews are still around is that they decided they were not leaving until they figured this thing out and i think that there is something about jews asking fundamental questions of existence because existence has been so naughty and so difficult and so sometimes tragic um that uh in jewish books there's all there there's jews don't write really jewish books are not light humor they're biting humor i think of the difference between uh jewish humor and say a pg woodhouse um that's light humor it's not like trying to get at the guts of existence the same but but jewish humor does it's um it's it can be very painful i know some jewish jokes that are actually painful because they're you know they're like deep and and difficult um so i wonder if there's something too about how in genesis god names things 01:0:0,549 --> 01:0:3,040 01:0:0,559 --> 01:0:4,480 and that is like god's power to name 01:0:3,030 --> 01:0:4,480 01:0:3,040 --> 01:0:5,440 something to give it a word you ever 01:0:4,470 --> 01:0:5,440 01:0:4,480 --> 01:0:6,880 name something 01:0:5,430 --> 01:0:6,880 01:0:5,440 --> 01:0:9,280 and then it has a name and then you try 01:0:6,870 --> 01:0:9,280 01:0:6,880 --> 01:0:9,280 to call it 01:0:9,670 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:0:9,680 --> 01:0:15,280 yep god creates the world with words 01:0:12,309 --> 01:0:15,280 01:0:12,319 --> 01:0:18,160 that's what that god is a word 01:0:15,270 --> 01:0:18,160 01:0:15,280 --> 01:0:18,799 god um it said god god doesn't spin the 01:0:18,150 --> 01:0:18,799 01:0:18,160 --> 01:0:21,520 world on 01:0:18,789 --> 01:0:21,520 01:0:18,799 --> 01:0:22,960 on a finger god says let there be light 01:0:21,510 --> 01:0:22,960 01:0:21,520 --> 01:0:25,359 and there's light 01:0:22,950 --> 01:0:25,359 01:0:22,960 --> 01:0:28,559 so the very in fact in the morning 01:0:25,349 --> 01:0:28,559 01:0:25,359 --> 01:0:30,480 prayers we say baruch 01:0:28,549 --> 01:0:30,480 01:0:28,559 --> 01:0:31,599 blessed be the one who spoke and there 01:0:30,470 --> 01:0:31,599 01:0:30,480 --> 01:0:33,599 was a world 01:0:31,589 --> 01:0:33,599 01:0:31,599 --> 01:0:34,960 so as soon as you have a god who creates 01:0:33,589 --> 01:0:34,960 01:0:33,599 --> 01:0:38,160 the world by 01:0:34,950 --> 01:0:38,160 01:0:34,960 --> 01:0:38,480 words you know that words are going to 01:0:38,150 --> 01:0:38,480 01:0:38,160 --> 01:0:41,680 01:0:38,470 --> 01:0:41,680 01:0:38,480 --> 01:0:44,880 very powerful for this tradition 01:0:41,670 --> 01:0:44,880 01:0:41,680 --> 01:0:47,599 the revelation at sinai is words that's 01:0:44,870 --> 01:0:47,599 01:0:44,880 --> 01:0:51,440 what it is it's not like god comes down 01:0:47,589 --> 01:0:51,440 01:0:47,599 --> 01:0:54,240 and says here i am no god gives 01:0:51,430 --> 01:0:54,240 01:0:51,440 --> 01:0:54,720 tablets that have words on them so for 01:0:54,230 --> 01:0:54,720 01:0:54,240 --> 01:0:56,960 the jew 01:0:54,710 --> 01:0:56,960 01:0:54,720 --> 01:0:59,280 in fact i wrote my second book was about 01:0:56,950 --> 01:0:59,280 01:0:56,960 --> 01:1:2,000 this idea it was called in speech and 01:0:59,270 --> 01:1:2,000 01:0:59,280 --> 01:1:3,040 in silence the jewish quest for god it 01:1:1,990 --> 01:1:3,040 01:1:2,000 --> 01:1:5,599 was all about how 01:1:3,030 --> 01:1:5,599 01:1:3,040 --> 01:1:6,960 words in the jewish tradition play the 01:1:5,589 --> 01:1:6,960 01:1:5,599 --> 01:1:10,240 world they do and it was 01:1:6,950 --> 01:1:10,240 01:1:6,960 --> 01:1:12,400 inspired by my mother when she was 01:1:10,230 --> 01:1:12,400 01:1:10,240 --> 01:1:14,559 in her early 50s had a stroke and became 01:1:12,390 --> 01:1:14,559 01:1:12,400 --> 01:1:17,280 a phasic she couldn't speak 01:1:14,549 --> 01:1:17,280 01:1:14,559 --> 01:1:18,559 and uh and and was that way for the rest 01:1:17,270 --> 01:1:18,559 01:1:17,280 --> 01:1:21,920 of her life 01:1:18,549 --> 01:1:21,920 01:1:18,559 --> 01:1:22,559 and so i began to think much much more 01:1:21,910 --> 01:1:22,559 01:1:21,920 --> 01:1:25,440 deeply 01:1:22,549 --> 01:1:25,440 01:1:22,559 --> 01:1:26,960 because of her tragedy about what words 01:1:25,430 --> 01:1:26,960 01:1:25,440 --> 01:1:29,040 mean and what they don't mean 01:1:26,950 --> 01:1:29,040 01:1:26,960 --> 01:1:30,480 and and there's no doubt the more you 01:1:29,030 --> 01:1:30,480 01:1:29,040 --> 01:1:31,200 investigate the jewish tradition the 01:1:30,470 --> 01:1:31,200 01:1:30,480 --> 01:1:33,440 more 01:1:31,190 --> 01:1:33,440 01:1:31,200 --> 01:1:35,040 the word is at the heart of it yeah let 01:1:33,430 --> 01:1:35,040 01:1:33,440 --> 01:1:36,160 me give you two examples i think the 01:1:35,030 --> 01:1:36,160 01:1:35,040 --> 01:1:38,079 first was 01:1:36,150 --> 01:1:38,079 01:1:36,160 --> 01:1:39,280 when i was in hebrew school we never 01:1:38,069 --> 01:1:39,280 01:1:38,079 --> 01:1:42,240 wrote g o d 01:1:39,270 --> 01:1:42,240 01:1:39,280 --> 01:1:42,880 we wrote g dash d we never wrote the 01:1:42,230 --> 01:1:42,880 01:1:42,240 --> 01:1:45,200 holy 01:1:42,870 --> 01:1:45,200 01:1:42,880 --> 01:1:46,960 the holy name of god and then whenever 01:1:45,190 --> 01:1:46,960 01:1:45,200 --> 01:1:49,119 we would drop a torah 01:1:46,950 --> 01:1:49,119 01:1:46,960 --> 01:1:50,240 you kissed the torah when you picked it 01:1:49,109 --> 01:1:50,240 01:1:49,119 --> 01:1:53,760 up 01:1:50,230 --> 01:1:53,760 01:1:50,240 --> 01:1:56,000 right i think that that second example 01:1:53,750 --> 01:1:56,000 01:1:53,760 --> 01:1:57,599 especially that you would kiss something 01:1:55,990 --> 01:1:57,599 01:1:56,000 --> 01:1:58,799 with words when you kiss the mezuzah 01:1:57,589 --> 01:1:58,799 01:1:57,599 --> 01:2:0,160 which people do it's not you're not 01:1:58,789 --> 01:2:0,160 01:1:58,799 --> 01:2:1,599 kissing the design 01:2:0,150 --> 01:2:1,599 01:2:0,160 --> 01:2:3,359 you're kissing the fact that it has a 01:2:1,589 --> 01:2:3,359 01:2:1,599 --> 01:2:6,480 scroll in it with god's name 01:2:3,349 --> 01:2:6,480 01:2:3,359 --> 01:2:8,000 because words along with human life 01:2:6,470 --> 01:2:8,000 01:2:6,480 --> 01:2:10,799 words are the only other things that are 01:2:7,990 --> 01:2:10,799 01:2:8,000 --> 01:2:12,090 holy so yeah 01:2:10,789 --> 01:2:12,090 01:2:10,799 --> 01:2:14,880 that's why we're funny 01:2:12,080 --> 01:2:14,880 01:2:12,090 --> 01:2:18,160 [Laughter] 01:2:14,870 --> 01:2:18,160 01:2:14,880 --> 01:2:21,280 that's funny um so 01:2:18,150 --> 01:2:21,280 01:2:18,160 --> 01:2:23,200 one of the things that i 01:2:21,270 --> 01:2:23,200 01:2:21,280 --> 01:2:24,559 i i've gotten to explore preparing for 01:2:23,190 --> 01:2:24,559 01:2:23,200 --> 01:2:26,559 this is my own name 01:2:24,549 --> 01:2:26,559 01:2:24,559 --> 01:2:28,480 i can't believe i had never had a 01:2:26,549 --> 01:2:28,480 01:2:26,559 --> 01:2:30,079 serious interaction with my name and you 01:2:28,470 --> 01:2:30,079 01:2:28,480 --> 01:2:31,280 wrote a book called king david the 01:2:30,069 --> 01:2:31,280 01:2:30,079 --> 01:2:35,839 divided heart 01:2:31,270 --> 01:2:35,839 01:2:31,280 --> 01:2:39,119 and david is a deeply paradoxical figure 01:2:35,829 --> 01:2:39,119 01:2:35,839 --> 01:2:40,319 both of us are named after him and david 01:2:39,109 --> 01:2:40,319 01:2:39,119 --> 01:2:44,400 means beloved 01:2:40,309 --> 01:2:44,400 01:2:40,319 --> 01:2:45,039 but also there are aspects of david that 01:2:44,390 --> 01:2:45,039 01:2:44,400 --> 01:2:46,799 are 01:2:45,029 --> 01:2:46,799 01:2:45,039 --> 01:2:48,319 that are evil that are sinful but then 01:2:46,789 --> 01:2:48,319 01:2:46,799 --> 01:2:50,880 he was also this this 01:2:48,309 --> 01:2:50,880 01:2:48,319 --> 01:2:51,920 this magnificent king and husband and a 01:2:50,870 --> 01:2:51,920 01:2:50,880 --> 01:2:54,880 caretaker 01:2:51,910 --> 01:2:54,880 01:2:51,920 --> 01:2:55,599 and you begin by saying that he's like 01:2:54,870 --> 01:2:55,599 01:2:54,880 --> 01:2:59,359 the first 01:2:55,589 --> 01:2:59,359 01:2:55,599 --> 01:3:1,200 human being in literature what besides 01:2:59,349 --> 01:3:1,200 01:2:59,359 --> 01:3:3,599 the fact that you were named after him 01:3:1,190 --> 01:3:3,599 01:3:1,200 --> 01:3:7,119 drew you to studying david and 01:3:3,589 --> 01:3:7,119 01:3:3,599 --> 01:3:10,240 where did that exploration take you 01:3:7,109 --> 01:3:10,240 01:3:7,119 --> 01:3:12,160 so i was asked i was asked to write a 01:3:10,230 --> 01:3:12,160 01:3:10,240 --> 01:3:15,119 book for the yale university press 01:3:12,150 --> 01:3:15,119 01:3:12,160 --> 01:3:16,079 series it has a jewish live series 01:3:15,109 --> 01:3:16,079 01:3:15,119 --> 01:3:17,280 ancient and modern 01:3:16,069 --> 01:3:17,280 01:3:16,079 --> 01:3:18,960 and so on and they asked me if i would 01:3:17,270 --> 01:3:18,960 01:3:17,280 --> 01:3:21,680 consider writing a book and if so who 01:3:18,950 --> 01:3:21,680 01:3:18,960 --> 01:3:24,640 did i want to write about 01:3:21,670 --> 01:3:24,640 01:3:21,680 --> 01:3:28,160 and uh and i thought about it and i 01:3:24,630 --> 01:3:28,160 01:3:24,640 --> 01:3:31,280 thought you know i've always wanted 01:3:28,150 --> 01:3:31,280 01:3:28,160 --> 01:3:32,559 not to write about david but to know 01:3:31,270 --> 01:3:32,559 01:3:31,280 --> 01:3:34,880 more about david 01:3:32,549 --> 01:3:34,880 01:3:32,559 --> 01:3:35,599 and this is the best way to learn about 01:3:34,870 --> 01:3:35,599 01:3:34,880 --> 01:3:37,200 somebody 01:3:35,589 --> 01:3:37,200 01:3:35,599 --> 01:3:38,880 is to teach about them or to write about 01:3:37,190 --> 01:3:38,880 01:3:37,200 --> 01:3:41,599 them and so 01:3:38,870 --> 01:3:41,599 01:3:38,880 --> 01:3:44,000 i i took that on in part because david 01:3:41,589 --> 01:3:44,000 01:3:41,599 --> 01:3:46,160 is the most developed character by 01:3:43,990 --> 01:3:46,160 01:3:44,000 --> 01:3:47,839 far in the hebrew bible no one else 01:3:46,150 --> 01:3:47,839 01:3:46,160 --> 01:3:49,760 comes close 01:3:47,829 --> 01:3:49,760 01:3:47,839 --> 01:3:50,960 and second because as you say he's such 01:3:49,750 --> 01:3:50,960 01:3:49,760 --> 01:3:55,280 a problematic 01:3:50,950 --> 01:3:55,280 01:3:50,960 --> 01:3:58,319 character he is 01:3:55,270 --> 01:3:58,319 01:3:55,280 --> 01:4:1,680 he is savage 01:3:58,309 --> 01:4:1,680 01:3:58,319 --> 01:4:4,960 and sublime and 01:4:1,670 --> 01:4:4,960 01:4:1,680 --> 01:4:8,079 a poet and a lover and a murderer 01:4:4,950 --> 01:4:8,079 01:4:4,960 --> 01:4:11,200 and repentant and 01:4:8,069 --> 01:4:11,200 01:4:8,079 --> 01:4:11,760 a king and and depicted in some ways as 01:4:11,190 --> 01:4:11,760 01:4:11,200 --> 01:4:14,799 a son 01:4:11,750 --> 01:4:14,799 01:4:11,760 --> 01:4:17,440 and as a as a father um 01:4:14,789 --> 01:4:17,440 01:4:14,799 --> 01:4:18,240 and as a lover of women in every sense 01:4:17,430 --> 01:4:18,240 01:4:17,440 --> 01:4:19,839 of that word 01:4:18,230 --> 01:4:19,839 01:4:18,240 --> 01:4:22,160 someone who listens to women and pays 01:4:19,829 --> 01:4:22,160 01:4:19,839 --> 01:4:26,160 attention to them and does what they say 01:4:22,150 --> 01:4:26,160 01:4:22,160 --> 01:4:29,520 um and i have to say that the 01:4:26,150 --> 01:4:29,520 01:4:26,160 --> 01:4:30,400 more i i study david and the more i 01:4:29,510 --> 01:4:30,400 01:4:29,520 --> 01:4:31,599 continue to 01:4:30,390 --> 01:4:31,599 01:4:30,400 --> 01:4:34,480 because this isn't something that 01:4:31,589 --> 01:4:34,480 01:4:31,599 --> 01:4:36,240 stopped when i finished the book 01:4:34,470 --> 01:4:36,240 01:4:34,480 --> 01:4:38,240 um the more i am amazed at the 01:4:36,230 --> 01:4:38,240 01:4:36,240 --> 01:4:41,440 contradictions of his character 01:4:38,230 --> 01:4:41,440 01:4:38,240 --> 01:4:45,039 and the way in which he embraces 01:4:41,430 --> 01:4:45,039 01:4:41,440 --> 01:4:47,920 almost all of the human of his time 01:4:45,029 --> 01:4:47,920 01:4:45,039 --> 01:4:50,079 and i think that that's part of the 01:4:47,910 --> 01:4:50,079 01:4:47,920 --> 01:4:51,440 reason why his contemporaries were so 01:4:50,069 --> 01:4:51,440 01:4:50,079 --> 01:4:54,960 fascinated 01:4:51,430 --> 01:4:54,960 01:4:51,440 --> 01:4:56,640 uh with him because it is rare to find 01:4:54,950 --> 01:4:56,640 01:4:54,960 --> 01:4:58,160 somebody who's that large 01:4:56,630 --> 01:4:58,160 01:4:56,640 --> 01:5:0,079 in fact i don't know anyone who's quite 01:4:58,150 --> 01:5:0,079 01:4:58,160 --> 01:5:3,119 that large a person 01:5:0,069 --> 01:5:3,119 01:5:0,079 --> 01:5:6,880 um in the depiction of him now 01:5:3,109 --> 01:5:6,880 01:5:3,119 --> 01:5:8,720 uh i'm sure 01:5:6,870 --> 01:5:8,720 01:5:6,880 --> 01:5:12,880 i mean it's they're called the yell the 01:5:8,710 --> 01:5:12,880 01:5:8,720 --> 01:5:12,880 brief lives right so it's a short book 01:5:13,190 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:5:13,200 --> 01:5:16,799 you could write a whole nother book 01:5:15,109 --> 01:5:16,799 01:5:15,119 --> 01:5:19,440 about david so rich 01:5:16,789 --> 01:5:19,440 01:5:16,799 --> 01:5:21,119 is his life um and you could come to 01:5:19,430 --> 01:5:21,119 01:5:19,440 --> 01:5:23,119 different conclusions 01:5:21,109 --> 01:5:23,119 01:5:21,119 --> 01:5:24,960 but i don't think it is possible to see 01:5:23,109 --> 01:5:24,960 01:5:23,119 --> 01:5:27,680 him and not see 01:5:24,950 --> 01:5:27,680 01:5:24,960 --> 01:5:28,400 um what my subtitle was the divided 01:5:27,670 --> 01:5:28,400 01:5:27,680 --> 01:5:30,480 heart 01:5:28,390 --> 01:5:30,480 01:5:28,400 --> 01:5:32,240 that david is pulled in many many 01:5:30,470 --> 01:5:32,240 01:5:30,480 --> 01:5:34,799 different directions at different times 01:5:32,230 --> 01:5:34,799 01:5:32,240 --> 01:5:35,440 and and the complexities of his 01:5:34,789 --> 01:5:35,440 01:5:34,799 --> 01:5:39,599 character 01:5:35,430 --> 01:5:39,599 01:5:35,440 --> 01:5:42,160 are are stunning and and remarkable 01:5:39,589 --> 01:5:42,160 01:5:39,599 --> 01:5:43,920 a lot of the modern world has this 01:5:42,150 --> 01:5:43,920 01:5:42,160 --> 01:5:47,200 thirst for novelty 01:5:43,910 --> 01:5:47,200 01:5:43,920 --> 01:5:49,359 and judaism with these sacred texts 01:5:47,190 --> 01:5:49,359 01:5:47,200 --> 01:5:51,280 we go back and what you're doing with 01:5:49,349 --> 01:5:51,280 01:5:49,359 --> 01:5:54,480 that book is you're going back 01:5:51,270 --> 01:5:54,480 01:5:51,280 -->

01:6:0,870 --> 01:6:3,680 01:6:0,880 --> 01:6:5,839 of ideas that have existed for a long 01:6:3,670 --> 01:6:5,839 01:6:3,680 --> 01:6:5,839 01:6:6,710 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:6:6,720 --> 01:6:11,599

scholarship it doesn't end 01:6:13,589 --> 01:6:15,760 01:6:13,599 --> 01:6:17,119 um archaeology because they've uncovered 01:6:15,750 --> 01:6:17,119 01:6:15,760 --> 01:6:18,319 some stuff that they believe is from 01:6:17,109 --> 01:6:18,319 01:6:17,119 --> 01:6:21,359 davidstein 01:6:18,309 --> 01:6:21,359 01:6:18,319 --> 01:6:23,680 uh that's um 01:6:21,349 --> 01:6:23,680 01:6:21,359 --> 01:6:24,720 that's one one of the glories of a long 01:6:23,670 --> 01:6:24,720 01:6:23,680 --> 01:6:28,160 tradition 01:6:24,710 --> 01:6:28,160 01:6:24,720 --> 01:6:30,839 is that as i said look i

01:6:32,000 --> 01:6:36,160 i'm sure there are libraries that i 01:6:33,750 --> 01:6:36,160 01:6:33,760 --> 01:6:38,880 didn't even get to 01:6:36,150 --> 01:6:38,880 01:6:36,160 --> 01:6:40,240

world 01:7:17,029 --> 01:7:19,280 01:7:17,039 --> 01:7:21,119 um other people have experienced 01:7:19,270 --> 01:7:21,119 01:7:19,280 --> 01:7:21,839 something very similar if not exactly 01:7:21,109 --> 01:7:21,839 01:7:21,119 --> 01:7:23,599 the same thing 01:7:21,829 --> 01:7:23,599 01:7:21,839 --> 01:7:25,200 and if you're looking in the right place 01:7:23,589 --> 01:7:25,200 01:7:23,599 -->

the 01:7:28,150 --> 01:7:29,119 01:7:28,160 --> 01:7:30,160 first one is 01:7:29,109 --> 01:7:30,160 01:7:29,119 --> 01:7:33,119 i'm just going to give you a thought 01:7:30,150 --> 01:7:33,119 01:7:30,160 --> 01:7:36,559 experiment here and 01:7:33,109 --> 01:7:36,559 01:7:33,119 --> 01:7:37,760 if jews and rabbis in particular have 01:7:36,549 --> 01:7:37,760 01:7:36,559 --> 01:7:40,079 the ability 01:7:37,750 --> 01:7:40,079 01:7:37,760 --> 01:7:41,920 to interpret the bible and to make 01:7:40,069 --> 01:7:41,920 01:7:40,079 --> 01:7:43,280 interpretations and then change how we 01:7:41,910 --> 01:7:43,280 01:7:41,920 --> 01:7:45,680 do things 01:7:43,270 --> 01:7:45,680 01:7:43,280 --> 01:7:48,400 why don't we move the bar mitzvah age 01:7:45,670 --> 01:7:48,400 01:7:45,680 --> 01:7:50,079 back and let me give you a case for this 01:7:48,390 --> 01:7:50,079 01:7:48,400 --> 01:7:52,240 what a bar mitzvah is supposed to be is 01:7:50,069 --> 01:7:52,240 01:7:50,079 --> 01:7:53,760 a coming of age whereas i understand it 01:7:52,230 --> 01:7:53,760 01:7:52,240 --> 01:7:54,799 and you then become an adult in the 01:7:53,750 --> 01:7:54,799 01:7:53,760 --> 01:7:58,000 jewish faith 01:7:54,789 --> 01:7:58,000 01:7:54,799 --> 01:8:0,880 and in 2020 21st century 01:7:57,990 --> 01:8:0,880 01:7:58,000 --> 01:8:1,520 i don't think that being 13 is old 01:8:0,870 --> 01:8:1,520 01:8:0,880 --> 01:8:5,119 enough 01:8:1,510 --> 01:8:5,119 01:8:1,520 --> 01:8:6,799 in order to do that um what if we move 01:8:5,109 --> 01:8:6,799 01:8:5,119 --> 01:8:7,280 the bar mitzvah age back and why don't 01:8:6,789 --> 01:8:7,280 01:8:6,799 --> 01:8:11,200 we 01:8:7,270 --> 01:8:11,200 01:8:7,280 --> 01:8:12,640 consider that we have considered it 01:8:11,190 --> 01:8:12,640 01:8:11,200 --> 01:8:14,640 people would love to do it but i don't 01:8:12,630 --> 01:8:14,640 01:8:12,640 --> 01:8:16,719 think it's possible uh the reason that 01:8:14,630 --> 01:8:16,719 01:8:14,640 --> 01:8:19,199 it's not possible is because 01:8:16,709 --> 01:8:19,199 01:8:16,719 --> 01:8:20,640 there's no even though the the reason 01:8:19,189 --> 01:8:20,640 01:8:19,199 --> 01:8:21,920 that rabbis would like to do it is 01:8:20,630 --> 01:8:21,920 01:8:20,640 --> 01:8:22,640 because it would keep people in jewish 01:8:21,910 --> 01:8:22,640 01:8:21,920 --> 01:8:24,560 school longer 01:8:22,630 --> 01:8:24,560 01:8:22,640 --> 01:8:26,799 that's the main reason because it would 01:8:24,550 --> 01:8:26,799 01:8:24,560 --> 01:8:29,920 it because right now people's gender 01:8:26,789 --> 01:8:29,920 01:8:26,799 --> 01:8:31,279 genuine generally people's impression of 01:8:29,910 --> 01:8:31,279 01:8:29,920 --> 01:8:34,239 what judaism is about 01:8:31,269 --> 01:8:34,239 01:8:31,279 --> 01:8:35,199 finishes at 13. imagine if all you knew 01:8:34,229 --> 01:8:35,199 01:8:34,239 --> 01:8:36,719 01:8:35,189 --> 01:8:36,719 01:8:35,199 --> 01:8:38,319 i don't know anything mathematics 01:8:36,709 --> 01:8:38,319 01:8:36,719 --> 01:8:39,920 history whatever english 01:8:38,309 --> 01:8:39,920 01:8:38,319 --> 01:8:42,560 stopped at 13. so they have a very 01:8:39,910 --> 01:8:42,560 01:8:39,920 --> 01:8:46,640 juvenile conception of what judaism is 01:8:42,550 --> 01:8:46,640 01:8:42,560 --> 01:8:48,239 um but it's i'm afraid it's a no-go 01:8:46,630 --> 01:8:48,239 01:8:46,640 --> 01:8:49,679 the parents won't do it the children 01:8:48,229 --> 01:8:49,679 01:8:48,239 --> 01:8:52,640 won't do it um 01:8:49,669 --> 01:8:52,640 01:8:49,679 --> 01:8:53,520 it's just logistically enormously 01:8:52,630 --> 01:8:53,520 01:8:52,640 --> 01:8:54,719 difficult 01:8:53,510 --> 01:8:54,719 01:8:53,520 --> 01:8:56,880 even though i agree with you 01:8:54,709 --> 01:8:56,880 01:8:54,719 --> 01:8:58,560 ideologically it would be it would be 01:8:56,870 --> 01:8:58,560 01:8:56,880 --> 01:8:59,759 beneficial 01:8:58,550 --> 01:8:59,759 01:8:58,560 --> 01:9:1,359 yeah so if you want to start the 01:8:59,749 --> 01:9:1,359 01:8:59,759 --> 01:9:2,799 national movement good luck to you 01:9:1,349 --> 01:9:2,799 01:9:1,359 --> 01:9:6,159 honestly i would consider it 01:9:2,789 --> 01:9:6,159 01:9:2,799 --> 01:9:9,759 i mean one of the things that i i think 01:9:6,149 --> 01:9:9,759 01:9:6,159 --> 01:9:12,560 that we need is having 01:9:9,749 --> 01:9:12,560 01:9:9,759 --> 01:9:14,319 more time in with at least open 01:9:12,550 --> 01:9:14,319 01:9:12,560 --> 01:9:15,759 religious education where it's normal 01:9:14,309 --> 01:9:15,759 01:9:14,319 --> 01:9:18,159 where you can do that till later 01:9:15,749 --> 01:9:18,159 01:9:15,759 --> 01:9:20,080 and that is one of the great things 01:9:18,149 --> 01:9:20,080 01:9:18,159 --> 01:9:24,080 about religious traditions where 01:9:20,070 --> 01:9:24,080 01:9:20,080 --> 01:9:26,159 philosophy if you take that after 01:9:24,070 --> 01:9:26,159 01:9:24,080 --> 01:9:28,880 undergrad you basically only study it if 01:9:26,149 --> 01:9:28,880 01:9:26,159 --> 01:9:31,600 you intend to become a philosopher 01:9:28,870 --> 01:9:31,600 01:9:28,880 --> 01:9:33,199 and churches and synagogues they have a 01:9:31,590 --> 01:9:33,199 01:9:31,600 --> 01:9:34,080 different take on it they say you study 01:9:33,189 --> 01:9:34,080 01:9:33,199 --> 01:9:37,520 this for your 01:9:34,070 --> 01:9:37,520 01:9:34,080 --> 01:9:39,839 life and whether you're jewish or not 01:9:37,510 --> 01:9:39,839 01:9:37,520 --> 01:9:41,759 whatever your faith i think that for the 01:9:39,829 --> 01:9:41,759 01:9:39,839 --> 01:9:43,359 thing that you anchor yourself around it 01:9:41,749 --> 01:9:43,359 01:9:41,759 --> 01:9:46,799 should be a lifetime study 01:9:43,349 --> 01:9:46,799 01:9:43,359 --> 01:9:49,759 and i strongly believe 13 not old enough 01:9:46,789 --> 01:9:49,759 01:9:46,799 --> 01:9:51,920 to become an adult in the jewish face i 01:9:49,749 --> 01:9:51,920 01:9:49,759 --> 01:9:54,239 agree with you 01:9:51,910 --> 01:9:54,239 01:9:51,920 --> 01:9:54,239 01:9:56,229 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:9:56,239 --> 01:10:0,880 how this is this is i'll start with a a comment um i was talking to my roommate and i i came down and i had finished your book all in one sitting and i had been thinking a lot about these ideas probably more than any podcast and memory i just spent just absorbing all the things that you had said and there was something really interesting that i think spoke to the essence of my interpretation of what you're trying to do with your work and um my my roommate said are you drawn to rabbi wolpi or are you drawn to the faith through rabbi wolfie and i said i'm drawn to the faith through rabbi wolpi and i'm wondering if there's something in what it means to be a rabbi the main function of a rabbi is to teach but it is also true that rabbis do a lot of life cycle events funerals weddings barn barb mitzvahs counseling but all of it is supposed to influenced by the teachings of the it's not it isn't supposed to come entirely from you it's supposed to come through you that whatever it is you've learned should come through you and and to the extent that it does you're more likely to be successful um but in the modern world that's rabbis do all those things and they run organizations i mean i run a synagogue i have a staff i you know i belong to different organizations i write i do consult i do all that kind of stuff so it's a it's a job it's a job that is really great if you like to do a lot of different things um it is not it is not by any means a nine-to-five job uh so if you if you want a confined life and also i i the other point about it is it is a job that ident that becomes merged with who you are you don't go to the supermarket and say oh there's the lawyer you don't necessarily go to the supermarket and say oh there's the doctor but you do go to the supermarket and say oh there's the rabbi because you don't step away from your role when you step away from the synagogue so there are things about that that is that are good and things about that that are difficult but anybody who goes into the clergy has to know they are assuming an identity that they will not be able to shed at their convenience i can't say to you all of a sudden okay don't think of me as a rabbi right now so that's it's a uh having said that um i i feel unbelievably lucky really unbelievably lucky to have done what i have done thus far with my life and uh and i wouldn't change it rabbi wolfie thank you very much thank
