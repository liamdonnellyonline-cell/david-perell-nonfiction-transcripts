the psychologist and linguist stephen pinker says that language is a window into human nature and that is writers we reveal that human nature with each new word choice sentence structure and poetic device so what does your writing say about you collective human creation reflecting human nature how we conceptualize reality how we relate to one another and that by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language i think we can get a window onto what makes us tick when pinker says what makes us tick he's referring to the original emotional motivation for writing or for that matter saying anything at all the theory being he says that whenever we choose to externalize an internal thought the decision to communicate something it's got to be motivated by a deeper feeling or a deeper need now ready for what's really interesting this is the zinger for pinker he says that the same thing is happening when we read why because we're choosing to consume information based on those deeper emotional motivations as well and that fact right there it's the foundation for the magic of literature and honestly for that matter just about all good writing you see good writing happens when a reader intuitively understands the writer's deeper emotional motivation for creating that piece and good writing happens when it's the same motivation that the reader has for coming to that piece it's this raw connection this connection that transcends time and space which synthesizes verbal and emotional communication that allows us to both cry over shakespeare are real in horror when we read poe and that's why pinker argues that if you want your essay your article whatever it is that you're writing to successfully both connect and to resonate with your reader you gotta first understand the deeper motivations that are driving you to write that piece in the first place and sometimes the best way to find it is just by telling other people about your writing ask them what do you think my piece is about what emotions am i trying to convey and i think pinker describes it really well right here i think is a fundamental uh feature of human thought and it's the basis for much human argumentation in which people don't differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed okay so what's pinker saying here he's saying that if you write something like invading iraq versus liberating iraq or redistributing wealth versus confiscating earnings you reveal your personal stance on the issue now this doesn't mean that you should just write highly subjective and opinionated op-ed pieces full of emotional bias that's not the point here the point is that most writers who struggle they just don't know how they feel about what they're writing about and so they hide behind this overly stylized verbose academic writing in an attempt to distance themselves from their piece they're scared of it and in the end it ends up alienating most readers but if you want your writing to resonate with your audience if you want your reading to have an impact you got to first do the work to figure out your own feelings about your subject material what are you trying to say here what emotion are you trying to convey and why are you putting pen to paper fingers to keyboard in the first place and then after all that why should somebody read what you have to say and don't forget you can actually figure a lot of this stuff out through writing taking notes or free form journaling about a subject they're both good ways to understand your emotional relationship to it and then once you've done that journaling that note taking you can then turn your attention outward pinker he'll tell you that what unites most bad writing is just a lack of regard for the reader and he warns us to beware of the curse of knowledge which is when you know something so well that you don't even remember what it's like to not know it you know one example that comes to mind is when you're in school you're sitting in class and a professor is just rambling on and on and on about the intricacies of some subject that they're an expert in that they've been studying for years and you're sitting there in your seat you're just trying to wrap your head around the introductory ideas as a consumer of ideas of information as a student you feel unseen uncared for disregarded and that's exactly how your readers are going to feel if you're writing like they know everything but look there's a balance here you don't want to treat your readers like they're stupid because that's not going to help you either so then how do you actually find the balance it all begins with a model of effective prose communication as i have been emphasizing writing is an unnatural act and good style must begin with a coherent mental model of the communication scenario how the writer imagines the reader and what the writer is trying to accomplish pinker's preferred communication style the classic style was first developed by two literary theorists francis noel thomas and mark turner in their book clear and simple as the truth which dictates that writing should be a conversation between the writer and the reader the ingredients of classic style are this prose is the window onto the world that the writer has seen something in the world that the reader has not yet noticed that the writer positions the reader so that she can see it with her own eyes that the writer and the reader are equals and that the goal is to help the reader see objective reality and they should do that in a conversational style and pinker has implemented these tenets of writing into all of his work and i think that's why his books are so popular you know think about how many academics have written books about their areas of expertise and how few of them have multiple new york times bestsellers like pinker from pinker i've learned that you don't need to be a psychologist or a linguist or to even be that passionate about these subjects to enjoy pinker's writing and why because he's following his own advice here in his writing he breaks down complex ideas in a way that entertains educates and also respects the intelligence of the average reader think about it good communication is clear when you're talking about something that you know a lot about that you feel confident in you speak clearly but then things change once we feel a little anxious we try to dress up our language and speak with all kinds of ten dollar essay t words that yeah they'd impress your high school english teacher but you know what to the reader they show that you're insecure about your ideas and it just makes it hard to understand what you're saying stephen pinker says in his book the sense of style the one that's all about writing that when you use your writing to build trust be yourself and connect deeply with your reader you create a form of beauty and for another video on how to improve your
