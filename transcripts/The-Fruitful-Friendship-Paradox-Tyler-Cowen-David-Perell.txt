to take a very utilitarian model of friendship are there diminishing marginal returns to it so say that you become friends with someone who's really smart you then get to know them you get to know how they think you incorporate the world view at what point does it you're just like hey i just don't really feel like being friends with this person uh that in general hasn't happened to me i think the people you pick ideally you'd like increasing returns where they keep on developing and you have such a common language and a common history with them you can keep on making it better i'm not predicting that always happens but it's what you want to look for and you ought to be able to achieve it a fair amount of the time at least if you yourself are continuing to improve you should be able to attract such people and maintain your connection with them what kinds of people do you want to attract how do you look at friendship and how it plays into your own production function people who are are in areas i don't know so well but i know the area or how they think well enough to communicate with them that's what i find very valuable so it's not necessarily other economists at all so what kinds of people have you learned the most from uh depends on the time horizon very early in my life it was 100 chess players and a small number of like junior high school teachers grade school teachers uh now a lot of tech people just people in the world of ideas people in my twitter feed what is it about people in silicon valley that make those friendships so fruitful for you thinking outside of the box uh they're not super smart but typically not that well educated so they haven't just learned the same things that other people have learned uh they're both thinkers and people who have had to do things and pass various reality tests and that makes them much much smarter so many academics are lacking in that the only test they've ever faced often is like can i publish this piece and i think that's stunting so is education then overrated well by whom i would say by the country as a whole it's still underrated uh but by smart people it's definitely overrated but maybe learning is actually what's underrated and education in everyone learning the same thing is the thing that is overrated well but if you look at american colleges and universities uh they typically don't publicize their completion rates but i suspect they're between like 38 to 40 percent and a lot of those people ought to finish but they don't they lack the self-confidence the discipline or their family has money problems and i i think if they assigned higher value to finishing their lives would be better even if they wouldn't in every case always learn so much
