what is the morgan household guide to writing he has built a life where he can walk aimlessly read aimlessly and pick when he wants to work all so that he can be more creative and write better and in this video we're going to look at household's writing process by focusing on his experience writing this book the psychology of money and his controversial theory that writers should write for themselves and not their audiences morgan house will never set out to be a writer he started writing as a stop gap while studying economics at usc but now 14 years later household is an award-winning financial writer a partner at the collaborative fund former columnist at the wall street journal and the author of this hugely popular book the psychology of money in his five years at the collaborative fund alone he's written more than 260 articles and then back when he wrote for the motley fool he was writing three articles a day five days a week which is a tremendous amount it's too much and like because i was playing the volume game three articles a day like they weren't any good because i was just i had an hour to think of an idea type it out and get it sent out but despite all that success hausel agrees that writing is hard of course it is and that's why he believes that good writing should be selfish and that it should actually come easily but how does that make sense let's break it down when morgan finds himself struggling to write that's when he knows his idea isn't working this proves to him that his thesis is wrong or that there's something missing because when something flows easily and the dots are essentially connecting themselves that's when you know an idea is good but then what's the trick to good writing how do you actually make the idea flow with clarity and ease when i interviewed morgan about this he made one point glaringly clear write for yourself the whole the whole purpose of that david is i feel like most writers most most writing courses would tell you know your audience know who are your audiences and write for them right in a way that's accessible for them etc and i don't think that's bad advice but what's always worked best for me is i just want to write stuff that i personally would be interested in reading that's why i call it selfish but household believes that if you're writing for yourself that excitement's going to shine through and become infectious to your readers they'll find it compelling to read because you found it interesting to write and hausel calls this selfish writing basically instead of seeking your target audience let your target audience find you and the internet has made this easier than ever before if you write online about things that excite you the right people are going to find you and this happens in writing it happens in photography it happens in filmmaking and because it's happening all across mediums there's people like hollywood film director wes anderson who also share this view because up to that point i really my attitude was just wait till they see this right and um and i and a lot of people were you know does this story hold together or you know is this people going to understand why these boys are acting like this and everything i think they're going to understand it's pretty funny much of household's life is built around keeping things simple and not trying to force ideas aren't working and he now only writes one article per week as opposed to the 15 that he was writing at the motley fool and he finds that the best ideas come to him when he isn't even in front of his computer when he's doing things like driving in the car or in the shower riding his bike or even walking he says that he goes on two to three walks per day and believes that that's actually where most of his writing and creative thinking happens and this is because people's brains they work differently when you're on a walk on a walk the analytical side of your brain goes dim you gotta stay alert and be aware of your surroundings which gets you away from that conscious processing that makes it hard to come up with new ideas in fact household believes that much of his writing work is just aimless and he gives his mind the time and the space to breathe to let ideas grow organically out of everyday experiences that's when he's finally ready to do the final portion of the work the actual writing where he can just enjoy letting all the ideas come out of his brain and just unwind and then he can put them together on the page morgan does this not just because it's effective but because it's fun for him too and it's another example of his selfish writing philosophy he's not writing in a way that goes and targets a reader he's writing in a way he actually likes the only i'm writing for an audience of one just me and i i really think of this as just the whole writing process is i want to research things that i'm interested about come up with a story that i think is neat and write it in a way that i would want to read it and that's it and it works because the reader can then feel the enthusiasm and the enjoyment of the process baked into the article itself writing the psychology of money wasn't easy for him despite his interest in the topic this book writing wasn't as easy as the kind of writing he was used to after nine months of struggling household's wife finally asked him what the hell is going on with your book and he realized that the issue was that he was trying to write the book the way he was supposed to rather than the way he actually wanted to originally the book was going to be ten chapters of four to five thousand words each which is a traditional chapter length but hausel was used to only writing two thousand word articles so instead of forcing himself to write in a way that didn't suit him or what he was used to he wrote for himself and adjusted the book to be 20 chapters roughly 2 000 words each but my favorite one is only 400 words but i really just want to make my point make it as succinctly as i can and then get out of your way and move to the next chapter there's one chapter in the book that is 400 words which is like one page and i think that's probably my favorite chapter in the in in the book and when i turned it into the publisher they said hey is this is this a mistake are we missing stuff here and i said no and they said well do you want to add more to that and i said no that's all i have to say on that topic and as like out of respect for the reader if i have nothing else to say then i'm done like move on i'm not going to waste your time rambling just to prove that i can write a long book if you're looking to improve your writing while achieving entrepreneurial success make
