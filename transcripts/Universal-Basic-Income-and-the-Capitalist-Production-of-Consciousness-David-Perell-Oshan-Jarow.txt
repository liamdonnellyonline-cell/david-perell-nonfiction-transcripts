well Oh Shawn welcome to the rite of passage fellowship show I guess that's what we're gonna call this yeah essentially out of all the fellows you and I go back the farthest we were fraternity brothers which is just crazy as both of us in a world of Elon University that was very different from the intellectual one that we inhabit now well and well we'll start talking about your essay in a little while why don't you introduce yourself first yeah yeah it's a pleasure to be here it's it's so funny to see the evolution from I think we were both had similar experiences at school to where we kind of uh you know we're flailing if we were trying to sink our teeth into things we're having a little trouble finding out how to direct things and uh and we wound up in interesting places but yeah emotion out in Kingston I am I'm really interested in kind of - you have two topics that that I really want to explore both through the essay but through everything else - and that's you know so there's economics which is what I was in school for us what I majored in but then there's also kind of the the realm of consciousness or contemplative practice or meditation that was something I grew up with most of my life by virtue my father I spent a lot of time in India maybe we'll get into that but I've always been really interested in the conversations that can come from bringing those two spaces together and I've always felt that there's kind of a lack of that kind of conversation happening so I was really excited to for the opportunity to write the essay because I'm really trying to synthesize a lot of the kind of looking around that done of how to tie these two you know ways of looking at the world into the same kind of conversation and it was a long process it was a lot of fun but I think it's really it's there's a lot of really interesting possibilities for what kind of developing it so it was really fun to take a stab at it and so why don't we start at the end and then work our way back up to the beginning so what you're doing here at least originally was trying to think of what are the different ways that people are thinking about universal basic income and what are some of the solutions that we like what would this cost you end up coming up with a three point six trillion dollar per year number right and you look at you're basically trying to say there isn't one way of doing a universal baking basic income there are many different ways and why don't we start there and then get into Hayek and some of the issues with market structure yeah yeah absolutely yeah was interesting on the earlier drafts of the of the essay I'd kind of structured it to just do a full survey of the entire kind of UPA ubi discourse and I kind of wound up getting a little more specific but it's really important even when I move towards a little more kind of broader a little more kind of philosophical analysis it was really important to keep the pragmatic end because so much talk about basic income is very kind of vague and remains at a high enough level where it's not making a pragmatic actionable kind of contribution and it's great to make the case but I think that we're at this stage and talking about basic income where we need to step into the specifics and so kind of the the broadest way to talk about it is basic income right but underneath basic income you have a couple different directions it can take there's universal basic income where everybody gets the same amount and then you kind of tax people on the back end to adjust the distribution there's a negative income tax which is you only give people the specific amount to get them up to a certain income threshold that way you don't have to tax on the back end so and then there's there's a basic income with the kind of high end phase-out rate where it's a ubi but you just don't give it to like really rich people so you just phase it out there so there's all these different kind of nuanced ways to do it but they're they're all forms of basic income and what's really like one of the most difficult aspects is a negative income tax in a ubi for example I have the exact same net outcome so the the costs ultimately shouldered by taxpayers are the same in those two proposals but that's totally counterintuitive because the ubi is a really high gross cost like the government has to raise like you said around three point six trillion and then dish it back out so that cancels out a lot but there's a lot of kind of ambiguity about kind of comparing the different ways to implement the basic income so I want - I wanted to give a little bit of clarity a little bit of insight into the specifics of policy proposals but I also wanted to connect those specifics to a kind of broader look at the economic environment and how it kind of relates to you know the development of subjectivity and consciousness and so on so I wanted to really bring those two angles together right a pragmatic look at how would basic income work what is the best kind of iteration and you know I'm not coming to a big conclusion but there are certain kind of ways of looking at what are the biggest questions before us right now in terms of making that kind of judgment call and like I said keeping that connected to a broader look at the the system on the whole yeah one of the most interesting ideas in this essay that I almost wish that you had explored more so maybe we can do some digging here together was not just talking about wealth inequality where most of the conversation is oh these people are so much wealthier than these other people but something that I've explored a little in terms of how I look at cities which is time inequality so if you look at cities you have more and more wealthier people who are moving into the center of the city and for example I was talking to a friend a couple weeks ago and she said that one of her co-workers commutes two and a half hours to and from work every day whereas in New York what you find is most of the people I know hey I mean I live in Williamsburg two stops outside of the city of Manhattan right in this center in the heart of it all I remember there was a girl in high school that we were talking about last night she commuted from a city called Hercules California into San Francisco and it took her more than an hour every day and the problem was there's an article in The New York Times that the headline was the subway is so slow it's making New Yorkers early and what the point was was that you don't just have to account for the length of the commute but you have to account for the variance of how long that commute takes and the reason why these workers were getting there early was because say that on average their commute took an hour and a half but often the commute took two hours and ten minutes they had to encounter for two hours and ten minutes mmm and then on average they'd get their 40 minutes early and then what you see is there are strong correlations between commutes and how commutes her quality of life and I think that this gets into this time and equality that I want to explore with you because I think it's a really good point and it's something that we're not talking about yeah no you're right it's something that I I also want to really dig into because it's been that's always been kind of you know when I look at basic income that's always been kind of little the glimmering piece that stuck out to me you know obviously it's exploding for all kinds of reasons you know more generally in a response to poverty or you mentioned inequality detaching livelihood from labor all these different things and these are all very important and they're very interesting in realms of the debate but I always thought there's something about the way it changes how we spend our time or how we can spend our time it's it's not anything definite but it it's a it enables possibility and I've always been looking for kind of the best way to to articulate that and there are two things that kind of help brought that into into focus for me the first was an article written by Eric pine hawker and they can hour I think it was back in 2014 and it was I I don't remember exactly but it was something like redefining capitalism or something like that but yeah so their idea is is to ask all right what is well right because this question about how do we how do we measure value what is wealth this is getting a lot more focused nowadays and so they kind of take a stab at this and they're like all right we are accumulating a number of solutions to human problems we're accumulating different ways of meeting our needs and increasingly kind of varied and useful and not so useful dimensions so that's like one aspect of wealth but the other aspect is access to those solutions so there's the solutions we accumulate as a society and the access that we have to these pre-existing solutions and if you look at the distribution of access across the population that's where you begin to see this time inequality right there are some people who have to spend the majority of their waking hours exchanging and commodifying their time in order to get enough income just to maintain their current condition just to maintain access to you know these solutions the problems we already have and then a kind of farther back framework to look at this is going back to Henry George political economists in the the late 1800s and he his I've been going through his book for a second time and he has a chapter and what he calls the law of human progress and so he gives another way to kind of find this inequality so for him progress is really about there's a kind of distribution of our time for how much we have to kind of exchange in order to maintain our condition so maintaining our condition was actually his language and once we're able to do that we then get to devote our mental energies and our time to what he calls progressive purposes but he says the whole thing of progress is decreasing the proportion of our time that has to go towards maintaining our conditions so that we can put more of our time towards improving our condition and exploring and innovating all these kinds of things and you're right in that I I think this is so important to to kind of bring into the conversation today because this is a really it makes I think one of the most profound differences in in the behaviors the projects and all these things that become available on a day to day basis right it's how much of my time is going towards X and how much can go towards Y so those two frameworks I thought we're really interesting it's nice to see but yet I'm in quality I think it's totally under developed and there's a lot more kind of we can attach all kinds of statistics to that I'm sure but yeah I think it's a really important dimension yeah one of that's a bit tangential but this is just so rich with ideas and I'm excited about this topic so excuse me going off a bit of a digression here but there's a quote from Alfred Whitehead where he says that civil as a civilization expands by the number of functions it can perform without consciously thinking about them so doing more thinking about those things less and it's funny because we think a lot of this in terms of building a business where a lot of what building a business is and you were working a restaurant for a while and it might actually be similar a lot of what good process is is it basically takes things that would be running in your brain puts them into a process so that they can be performed well and basically happen in the background and then you can move on to higher-order tasks and to me that seems like that seems like a kind of progress in the in the georgian sense but when it comes to the inequality and we're talking about time and equality i think that where time inequality kind of begins to pare with wealth inequality is it seems to me that the that the secret hidden in plain sight of capitalism is that you need to build equity like the people who have equity do seem to do so much better than the people who don't and what I see is I had always dreamed of oh my goodness if I have a job where I make six figures I'm gonna be set for life and then I got into the actual world of living in New York City being around people who were worth hundreds of millions of dollars at times and I saw they were putting their money in the stock market they were starting businesses and they had ownership in those businesses they were buying houses that appreciated with tremendous value and I think that what begins to come together here is you know on one hand I am sympathetic to people who have time inequality and or who don't have time and they're commuting and they're exhausted and they get home at the end of the day and they're like oh I can't do any more work that was so draining because you always have to be on but at the same time it's really interesting to have that paired with what is the cliche that is true that you have the world's information in your fingertips there's never been a better time to create something and monetize those creations but I think that there's something about the time and equality and the exhaustion of an hourly way the exhaustion of many working-class positions the exhaustion of long commutes that makes it impossible to tap into that wealth and those opportunities oh yeah and it's true because on an individual scale if you kind of look at you know the life in front of you and you want to spend as much of your time doing what you inherent lis value right whether or not that's remunerated on the market like how you just laid it out that's probably the best way to do it you want to generate wealth that's going to generate dividends it doesn't require you to exchange your time in you know to get it and so the question becomes like do we leave it up to this kind of meritocratic system meritocracy where some people are going to be able to do that some people aren't and what would it mean if we try to democratize that you know that foundation for people and so for George one of the ways another way that he describes progress is he says it it has to essentially function as collective ownership of the fruits so that when when civilization makes progress and it comes up with these kind of solutions to human problems they're not necessarily for sale on the market so much as they get sedimented in a cycle back down into the soil and so the soil becomes this kind of shared foundation that rises as civilization as civilization makes progress and so for him like his notion of equality is very similar to what we would think about as equal access today I think that's a really good example yeah yeah so Alaska has the Alaska Permanent Fund which is often talked about in terms of ubi because it's essentially a partial ubi so in 1982 Alaska passed a law where all the oil revenues had about a 25% tax slapped on them and all the revenues put into a portfolio and it's managed collectively by the state and every citizen gets an equal share and they wind up getting on average about 1,500 bucks a year on that that you know that's fluctuated over time and so that's that's used as a case study to look at a how do unconditional cash transfers kind of change the economy or the wood or you know how does inflation respond how do labor force participation rates responds and it's really interesting if you look at the the results that have been coming out of there I mean first of all Alaska so what they did essentially was socialize or nationalize oil they're like this is something that belongs to nobody therefore it belongs to everybody therefore if you're a company who's going to take this oil and sell it you're excluding other people from using it so you need to compensate them you're taking from the Commons and when you take from the Commons you have to compensate so that's kind of the thinking behind it it's a social dividend and it's ironic because Henry George's book his like main thing is to propose a land value tax where he wants to do the same thing for all lands you know he thinks land is should be commonly owned if you use it you're excluding other people therefore you need to compensate them but anyway with Alaska they've seen two really interesting results that are very relevant to thinking about basic income at a national scale in the US the first is with inflation right one of the most common kind of concerns about a basic income is if everyone gets 12,000 a year aren't landlords just gonna raise prices aren't stores gonna raise prices and that absorbs the whole thing Alaska in 1982 they had a higher inflation rate relative to the rest of the country and then they passed the you know the Permanent Fund and ever since like even today the relationship has flipped so now since they actually have a lower inflation rate than the rest of the country which is inch and granted you don't want to use Alaska as a full model for the whole American economy but you know there's been really interesting data bits coming out of that and it's um it's also really interesting to like how you frame that because a lot of times if we talk about taking collective ownership of something like oil it's gonna get slapped with oh that socialist and and kind of gets thrown out the window but we see how these different when you get into the pragmatics of something you can call it like ideologically whatever you want but that's assimilated fine in the capitalist context that's not Alaska's not threatening to become socialist so it's really interesting to see how that's coexisted and and it's very popular out there you know has a lot of favorable feeling so why don't you compare what happened in Alaska to something like the iPhone or something like Tesla because you make the case that actually a lot of that technology as the result of publicly funded research and development then the public isn't benefiting from this and I think that there's some good arguments here even going back this was a popular argument after 2008 where the government gave bailouts to big companies save them but then the people who had funded those bailouts through their taxes didn't benefit from hey we just bailed you out why aren't we getting a share of your increased stock value and your increased revenues now and I think that that's a really good argument yeah yeah one of the like the the pithy ways to put it is that we are socializing the risks and privatizing the returns right so this is really building off the work of Mariana Moscato and she wrote two books that are really important to this first was the entrepreneurial state and that's where she goes through the whole history of how publicly-funded R&D has played a role in all of these like really pivotal technologies to to the world as we know them today so she documents the iPhone the touchscreen technology I think she also went through some element of Google search algorithm but yeah the idea is that publicly funded R&D so taxpayer dollars you mean everybody have gone to kind of stimulate the initial which is the riskiest part of this kind of R&D this kind of innovation and then since then right companies use these technology so take the iPhone so Apple makes however much money off the iPhone and it's not to say like apples being incredibly greedy so on and so forth it's just plain and simple if the risk was publicly subsidized shouldn't a small portion of the returns also be sent back in the same in kind which would be as cash and I think like an interesting outgrowth of that of that way of looking at things is the conversation happening now about data dividends California has gotten pretty advanced on this but um you know the basic way to put is when we're surfing on facebook when we're surfing on Netflix all these kinds of things we're essentially providing labor for those companies because they're gathering behavioral data that is fed into the machine learning algorithm that they use to construct consumer profiles and they sell that to companies and so on so we're essentially contributing value and not getting compensated for it and so the idea shouldn't we get a finance share of the financial value that comes off of the labor that we've provided and so it's the same it's the same way of thinking now it's tough because I think of that more as a social dividend than a basic income because the thing about a basic income is that's very tied to a specific amount like providing enough to make a certain kind of difference whereas if you want to really break down how much of apples profits should we be entitled to or you know so on and so forth it's very tough to make that math add up to a basic income unless it's coupled up to much a number of other things and so you have to kind of ask yourself are you going to include these kind of socializing a bit of the returns are kind of just kickin the taxpayers back what they invested are you gonna include that in the kind of basic income discussion or are we gonna set up some kind of social dividend like Alaska has where the the capital flows are free to fluctuate as you know as the underlying cash does so as Apple's profits go up hypothetically some kind of tax would go up and we get a bigger kick as they go down we get less and so letting that kind of payout rate fluctuate I think is really important when we talk about that so for example Mazak ATO as well she is kind of hesitant or skeptical of a basic income but she's very much in favor of if we socialized the risks we should get a kick of the returns so it's an interesting distinction there but yeah and how is this different from just plain old taxes so I'm gonna ask just a really stupid question of ok we did Rd apples now one of the wealthiest companies in the world they pay a ton in taxes Thank You Apple and we use that money to build schools pay for roads what's the difference here yeah yes so there's - I think there would be two initial responses the first would be pushback on the idea that Apple pays a ton of taxes so if you look at the actual effective corporate tax rates so the corporate tax rate I think right now is that twenty four percent our 26 so I'm somewhere in there effective tax rates are usually between eleven and fifteen percent for most of those companies and it varies depending on what's written off and and so on and so forth but one big dimension when you talk about for example how can we get a more kind of just outcome in tax revenues in those situations without even having to talk about implementing a new tax or raising revenues it's just how do we get the effective tax rates up to the actual stated rate so that's there's a lot of kind of movement there beyond that like what kinds of taxes would function as kind of an outgrowth of the logic we've been talking about I'm not entirely sure you know corporate tax rates are really difficult because they're so dependent on so many other factors including international tax rates this is why you know people like Thomas Piketty and gabriel zucman who are talking about progressive tax rates they're saying like none of this makes sense unless the entire world comes together and we do this kind of collaboratively so it's it's really tricky when you talk about how do we how do we extract you know those those earnings were saying we might be entitled to I know for example in the in the proposal put together by California there was some it was some kind of small percentage tax that they would have levied on companies like Facebook's I don't know the specifics of it but yeah that's a really complicated question yeah do you worry at all that if we instill a universal basic income three point six trillion dollars average person gets what twelve thirteen fourteen thousand dollars a year not so much that they can live lavishly enough that they can live decently do you worry that then American business and many of the innovators in America will then want to move elsewhere and that basically what countries are doing is they're competing to provide a good environment for businesses to be built for new ideas to flourish and for people to come together and I was even looking last night six out of the seven fastest-growing states in the United States of America are on the west coast rights out right outside of California and of those states sixty percent of the new migrants into them are Californians New York now is losing people and my concern is that what will then happen is things get sort of we add more and more and more taxes but then we reduce the incentive for people the build here and we get into this Faustian bargain where we make this deal with the devil where we think that we're winning and long term what ends up happening is the whole thing leaves and so rather than being able to redistribute wealth and give that to different people we don't even have wealth to redistribute in the first place right yeah there's so many fun directions off there I so your absolute like this is a really important question right because like we mentioned we mentioned the three point six trillion number so that's the gross cost roughly of a generous poverty level basic income that gets everybody twelve thousand four hundred ninety dollars a year which is the federal poverty line where it gets really important like we mentioned the beginning to begin to really explore the nuances between something like ubi and something like a negative income tax is that in order to pass ubi so one thing I did in my essay was I included a funding section where I was like here are 12 taxes here are the projected revenues for these taxes both people who are pretty skeptical of them and the optimists here's how much they could raise here's how much if you put them together you know so on and so forth to try to give an idea of what it takes to raise three point six trillion dollars a year I mean that's that's massive and a lot of ubi advocacy will try to write that off and kind of marginalize that that element by saying sure it's a high gross cost but the net cost that's what matters like that's the actual expense but the fact is with a high gross cost you need to enact taxes adequate to raise that sum and so you're right if we're gonna go the direction of ubi we're talking about like a comprehensive tax overhaul and especially assuming that happened in the next few years it would be happening within an environment that the international tax scene has not quite shifted to the you know the collaborative environment that makes progressive taxation really likely so this is one of the reasons that in the essay I kind of offer a certain kind of a negative income tax it's like trying to push this idea of alright if a negative income tax in the ubi have the same net effect and there are a couple really important differences and you know in a vacuum I wish I think I'd prefer ubi but a negative income tax all you to raise it only has a single cost and that cost can range anywhere from 170 billion up until the highest range is about eight hundred ninety billion for an incredibly generous low phase-out rate negative income tax so the political feasibility and the the quantity of taxes that are required to pass a negative income tax relative to ubi one is much more feasible than the other in political terms even if you want to say economically they're they're equivalent because I've seen that cost I can imagine the u.s. passing a negative income tax it cost four hundred billion I mean that can be almost entirely funded by swapping out redundant welfare programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit Temporary Assistance for Needy Families there are certain things that just would would be doubled with a negative income tax II wouldn't want so that takes out a lot and so when you look at the political feasibility and I agree with you that it's really important to maintain the conditions for innovation right this is the dynamism of the economy so on and so forth and we don't want to erode that and that's actually one of the reasons that I gravitate towards things like a basic income in in whatever form because as opposed to the kind of 20th century model of providing direct services so giving people how is it's giving them food giving them kind of in-kind transfers basic income and cash kind of maintains the incentives for innovation in those industries more so than having the government determined the benefits does but I in terms of realism and and and so on and so forth I do think that it's really important to begin looking at how close can we bring a negative income tax in terms of its logistics to a basic income and how much should we consider you know the what are the sacrifices what are the trade-offs right if we're gonna push for ubi we need a really good reason to be enacting that many taxes as opposed to a negative income tax so the trade-offs are always on innovation and so on but yeah it's important to think about those you look a lot at market design and you begin to question the idea that of Friedrich Hayek basically saying that you know what we're just gonna let markets roam free and you take issue with that you begin to say you know what we can actually have markets that we design and I've been thinking a lot about this because I think that there's actually something wrong in our models of the world in terms of we think of top-down and with people like Robert Moses and with most people anti-communist saying okay a top-down society will not work anything top-down is oppressive we're not doing this so we've sort of thrown that out of the window but then what we said is you know what we're just gonna do bottom-up and we've become religious with bottom-up you know what it's bottom-up the problems that come from it you know what that's just part of the system it's a tax that we have to pay the gambling addictions the opioid addictions the way that adds just pollute our environment the way I could not believe it so this gonna this gonna blow your mind man I just like such a such a sad moment in in in in modern life so one of my favorite artists she was on Twitter and she what got stuck in Japan and had to make an emergency trip back to Paris and what she did was she said I want you guys to help me get money I need $500 and she said I'm not gonna accept $500 as a donation because you're gonna need your money so I found a platform that you're gonna sit down and you're just gonna watch ads and every time that you watch a 30-second ad I get a tenth of a cent and this is how I'm gonna pay for my flight back to France and I couldn't believe it it was the actual manifestation of what you're saying of harvesting attention for cash and to get back to the Hayekian point it was one of these bottom-up behaviors that's obviously sick it's obviously disgusting and it is the sign of a society that in this way has just dawn off the rails yeah that's like it's an actual black mirror yeah so Hayek is interesting I used to kind of just unreservedly criticize Hayek and then actually through my podcast I've been speaking with people I spoke with Alex Williams who he wrote the book inventing the future post capitalism and he did his PhD dissertation on Hayek and we had been speaking and I'd kind of assumed the context that you get in kind of progressive left circles where you're just gonna trash neoliberalism you're just gonna trash Hayek and Milton Friedman and he set me straight he was like hold on a second like Hayek you got a situation where he was he he was really interesting so you have to look at Hayek as a response to to his time right so he's coming out mid 20th century the kind of high time of the Keynesian welfare state in the u.s. so you have incredibly kind of top-down visions of how to run the economy right Keynes thought essentially the economy was a machine that you could learn and tune perfectly if you you know if you got into it deep enough so Hayek responds to that and wants to flip the whole thing over and he says okay no the government is this top-down vision there are all kinds of reasons why that's no good we need to go the other direction free markets so he the reason he was so enamored with free markets was because he saw them as technologies to democratize and decentralize the power that he had thought was getting overly concentrated with the government and so he builds his whole kind of theory of freedom in tandem with free markets eating's free markets are there you know the mechanisms that do this okay and so where I kind of try to pick in like I I think his heart was in the right place but I think he hadn't like you like you mentioned I think he had an inadequate understanding of freedom I think that he and also that's an absurd thing to say about Hayek I mean hi you know I'm sure I just don't understand him well enough but coming out of the culture that he did Hayek equated freedom with what we would call today is negative freedom so for Hayek an absence of anyone telling you what to do or forcing you to do something constitutes freedom as long as no one is forcing you into a decision you have meaningful freedoms and today there's kind of you know then a that discourse has gotten deeper and we've added to that understanding this idea of positive freedoms and especially within the context of market societies the argument is that there are certain resources that are required in order to actualize and actually kind of act upon your capacities to realize your capacities that it's not enough to just have an absence of explicit coercion but there are implicit forces as well and I think one of you know one of the easiest ways I think to point this out today intuitively is you know a young black girl born in Flint Michigan or at the south side of Chicago does she have the same kind of equal access meaningful freedoms as a young white male born in Manhattan to a wealthy family right so there there's kind of and this goes back to George right what's that ground that we're all coming in on and kind of operating from but so since Hayek had this idea that all it takes is the absence of explicit coercion free markets were the perfect complement to that right so anything government did was an intrusion upon that and again this is something that Muscato Mazak Otto's books do a really good job of kind of digging into is showing how this idea kind of took shape in our minds that government action is intervention it is always bad so on and so forth that has everything to do with this idea that free markets though they're on a spectrum right here's government action and here's free markets and one always pulls away from the other and so that what seems to me a better way to understand the interaction between government regulation and kind of market design is that regulations kind of form and together with social norms cultural norms technology you know the entire ecology of things going on in economy these things form the kind of basis out of which markets arise markets are kind of emergent out of there their underlying conditions and so it that creates a little more kind of participatory room it gives us this kind of way in we're okay if we tinker with this aspect right here how is that going to change the incentives of the market how is that going to change the outcomes that cascade from that so on and so forth so yeah I I think that understanding Hayek's theory of freedom is really important understanding why he was so you know gung-ho about free free markets and if you don't agree with his theory freedom if you think there's more to it than just the absence of explicit coercion then there's more to market design than just pure deregulation yeah so with Hayek there's actually a couple ways to look at this and I am running both arguments through my mind and I can't see where either of them are wrong so the first one is would be a libertarian argument saying we never got Hayek we have had market constraints and you haven't given us the opportunity to actually let markets work what you're calling capitalism what you're calling free markets isn't capitalist it isn't free enough and actually I think that there's a lot of good arguments to be made there then there is the other one basically saying you know what we are we have already been designing these markets and and and Oshun were already in market design we've been doing this the entire time and maybe what you're trying to say is we need to make the unconscious conscious and begin to think very deliberately about how we design our markets but then what Hayek would say is how can you I mean you just said it how can you as a market designer know the whole point of what Hayek was trying to say is that prices are an information mechanism their prices contain more knowledge about the world more knowledge about how we should be allocating resources than any human can and so my question to you would be say that you know what we're going to do market design what is the margin at which we actually have to stop there because if we take Hayek for his own word that the individual human mind is limited in its ability to understand the world then what is how does that not become some kind of slippery slope in you some kind of socialist communist centrally planned world that Hayek was totally against right yeah it's funny I was just watching a debate Christopher Hitchens from back in like the 70s and it was you know socialism versus capitalism and he was on the socialist side and it was interesting because they you know each gave their opening remarks and kind of halfway through the debate some one of the I think Hitchens his partner was saying you know our opponents the capitalists keep describing capitalist institutions that have nothing to do with how the world actually works so that was their their critique and then the capitalists get up there and they say well exactly capitalism has never existed like we have never seen capitalism yet and you're now you're absolutely right and so that's an interesting kind of thing to play with if we do not describe what we have now is capitalism but a kind of you know a distorted mix of all of these half efforts and and so on and so forth where how do we take that where do we go from there if if you want to go on this side of we've never had pure capitalism and we should try it out that if functionally that means eradicating the entire government so on and so forth it's a really interesting actually kind of corollary to anarchism but okay so it's so intuitively right it's that strikes one is kind of like whoa wait a second like we're just going to get rid of everything and so I I think that we can point to a couple dimensions that kind of show the value that government provides that markets even free markets fail to so one of the ways of thinking about this is to point to markets have an end of inevitably tended towards incentivizing short-term horizons and have failed to incentivize long-term investments especially ones that we would consider as kind of public good social good collective good the environment is the perfect example of this right now at some point you might imagine if we had pure capitalism at some point it would get to such a degree of crisis with the environment that it would recognize it's in its own interest in order to adjust to save it or something like that but you really don't want to play that game and take it any further than you have to so one of the roles of God and again like can't this is one of the things that Keynes thought was really important when he was writing about how to use an objectionable capitalism in order to get to a post-scarcity society like this was his whole thing he said the role of government we need to socialize a portion of investment because markets fail to invest in the public good in a way that properly kind of speaks to the capacities and and then the needs that we have as a society and I think that's I think that's kind of spot-on we can and we can see this for example even in in the world of finance right we can see how unregulated markets kind of tend towards particular short-term outcomes that to the to the collective notion of value or detrimental whereas in the short term individual you have massive gains so there's a kind of incentive problem I think that that I'm not sure how the pure capitalism argument would would respond to although I I assume Hayek wrote something about it I'd be curious but to me that's like the the the gut reaction of kind of to pump the brakes on this idea of full capitalism is his markets have already demonstrated their failure to direct investments kind of where we want it to go yeah I mean economics already has a language for this with externalities that if you go through basic econ 101 then what they'll say is we fail to price carbon properly we fail to price all these sorts of things properly and I think economics understands this but I'm actually not sure that our understanding of externalities is is nuanced enough and I think this is a really good time to pivot into when we were together in college and you were an econ major something happened where you felt like the economics discipline was lacking in some place that it wasn't integrating the experience of human consciousness properly it wasn't doing certain things and talked about those but then let's talk about the intersection let's build this bridge from graduating from Elon in 2015 and then going to India and I want to hear how this essay is really as synthesis of those two experiences yeah yeah yeah there's things that economics are blind to and you discover them so yeah when I was I was in college and so like I said I'd grown up around the kind of contemplative orientation my whole life so that was something that I already felt very very interested by consciousness always felt to me is kind of the thing like that's what's going on here that's that's the real kind of that's the question that you should be looking at and I went into economics still thinking that it seemed intuitive to me that the way we organize our societies which seems to have so much to do with economic incentives has so much to do with the the kinds of subjectivity that developed within that society that the kind of the spectrum of consciousness so one of the books I was reading Ken Wilber wrote it hit the first book he wrote it's called the spectrum of consciousness and so I had this term in my head the whole time and so I it seemed intuitive to me that the the economic organization of society has much to do with the spectrum of consciousness within that society right so there's a kind of give-and-take there but really like what I was getting at is I was trying to take an economic approach to subjective experience and so on and so forth so our you know our department and Elan on the whole was not really a kind of a heterodox you know out there places pretty straight yes yeah absolutely so I spent four years like here was this kid who was trying to talk about you know meditation and economics and the department had no idea what to do with me so when I got time to write my senior thesis and I just been trying to figure out like why are we for example why are we accepting tastes and preferences revealed preferences as why are we not evaluating them why do we not have any kind of normative evaluative dimension to the kinds of preferences the kinds of tastes the kinds of humans that economic systems produce like shouldn't as economists we kind of consider how incentives are functioning and how a design is functioning to create these things but value you know value is always price Prices value that's the marginal utility theory and so my senior thesis the closest I got was trying to write something about happiness economics so I was trying to write about and this was like as far as mainstream discourse has gone at the time was trying to price in subjective experience essentially and you know it was flailing they wound up kind of ditching me off to the outgoing department head who turns out was quite a heterodox guy but he was ready to retire you know so I spent a lot of time just kind of flailing through that stuff and when I graduated I thought all right you know I did not find the bridge it's not here so I kind of said economics aside I got a one-way ticket to Asia and my girlfriend I spent about a year out there with you know with explicit intention of just getting really into meditation getting really into yoga and getting to really you know to take Wilbur's term to explore the spectrum of consciousness what are all the different ways that it can feel like to be me in any given moment right and this is when I when I say contemplator practice right I'm not just talking about meditation to me that's anything that is kind of immersing yourself in the novelties of conscious experience so psychedelics fit into this conversation fits into this a certain kind of conversation social rituals I was once I spent a week or so at a monastery in Vermont actually and every morning at 4:00 in the morning the first thing we do is get down and chant like Tibetan deep throat chanting for about a half hour and out of everything I've done in my life like that remains one of the most salient kind of altered states of consciousness I've ever been in is just being like drowning in deep Tibetan throat chants it was just such an altered state and so there's this kind of you know interest that develops in oh there's a lot of different ways this can feel this whole thing so I go out to India and you know I'm looking at I'm doing this whole thing the meditation trip rehashing the old sixties pilgrimage and it's ironic because the the first thing we would do when we would go to a new place is we would go to the used book shops because there wasn't much to do we didn't you know we didn't have much internet connections we were reading a lot and the bookstores there maybe the most popular section was always meditation spirituality and so on but the second most popular section almost always was this kind of blend of eka and cultural studies and these are books that have been left behind by people who have been like coming and traveling for the past 50 60 years and I wound up kind of discovering the the economists and the kind of critical theorists and the people who were asking the questions that made sense to me but I didn't know existed I found these all through all these different used bookstores I was getting it like the Frankfurt School and critical theorists so a bunch of German Marxists in the early 20th century they're the Situationists in in France Marc Fisher more recently but there's this whole existing tradition of people who are asking and and looking at how capitalism functions to produce certain effects on consciousness that there's you know there's a continuity between the kind of exterior systems were existing within and the interior experience of of subjectivity and so that was really eye-opening because at the same time you know a lot of these ashrams and by this point it was like 2016 when I was in India a lot of these ashrams are mostly white Westerners and most of us you know we all had the economic privileges in our lives to be able to drop out get a you know get a ticket to India and spend some time just sitting there and it struck me as I was reading these books that we're not sitting here asking like how can we democratize these economic privileges that are enabling us to do this kind of thing or even you know a little more broadly why aren't we talking about how to structure society in such a way that we don't have to escape from it in order to kind of drop into these larger questions why doesn't society kind of help us in that process and so these questions were kind of a simmering with me and there is this there's a partition between these two spaces the contemplative circles the people into consciousness some of them were venturing into the idea of social activism and there there is a discourse about you know we have to overcome capitalist greed or even explicitly tying kind of consciousness to some kind of post capitalist project but that's still those are again those are just ideological kind of vague words it's not an actionable here's what we need to do and economists too as I said they were very hesitant to step towards the the kind of subjective outcomes of the the design of the economic systems there were these two people these two groups who are like I we should all be speaking you know we should all be connecting but we weren't so when I wound up coming back from India that was kind of the the question that I had with me is what are the kind of pragmatic implications of contemplative practice if we if we recognize that there is a continuity or that there's no barrier between interior experience and the exterior systems right we've been acting as if there's this partition between them but but there is no partition right there's it's totally porous it's totally permeable things it's a it's a continence of a continuous kind of spectrum so what would it mean if we thought about economic policy in service of or as a means to kind of nourish an enriched subjective experience what would we what kind of policies are things that kind of optimize our our environments so that the the natural outcome of existing with them existing within them the natural outcome of market incentives so on so forth are things that are actually kind of helping to co-create a more robust kind of experience of consciousness and so on and that's s where that's what I've been doing since it's and it's happening but it's it's slowly developing you know but I think it's really important yeah one of the questions that I have and let's make this one quick and then we'll move on to Graber is can you define subjective experience because my worry is that it's gonna be misinterpreted and subjective means oh as subjective is the opposite of objective but that's not what you're saying you're saying subjective is the felt experience of the ineffable undescribable qualities of what it means to be human the ones that we all know the experiences of falling in love of watching a grandfather pass away of watching your kids walk and laugh for the first time these moments that you can write about and you can speak about but they pale in comparison to the experience of feeling those moments and we know that they're so real but words can't actually touch them like a mirage in the desert yeah yeah this is you know this is the it's like a hot potato it's the question that you don't want to have to get into but you have to get into you know the differences between a subjective experience is kind of my cop-out from using the term consciousness because the consciousness to is incredibly vague so when when we talk about consciousness if you and I for the first time I just said that word you would have some kind of inclination like that would mean something to you you're gonna project something of your own you know conceptual framework onto what that means and it might not match up just right but we can we assume that there's enough continuity between what I am indicating and what you're kind of receiving that we can have a conversation that's not always the case right there's so in in the kind of a contemplative domain when you talk about consciousness there's a distinction between awareness and the contents of consciousness and the easiest way to kind of demonstrate that would be awareness is kind of the the overall environment or the screen and the contents are the movies that are projected onto the screen right so the awareness is always there or even that the awareness is the movie theater it's the whole space it's always there it's abiding its enduring and the contents kind of arise and fall and so on so there's all these different like levels of distinction that you can get into subjective experience yet it's what I'm describing when for example the first time that I took mushrooms I was sitting on a beach and what was so jarring about that experience is up until that point in my life I had just taken for granted that what it what it feels like to be ocean right now what it feels like when I look at this lamp next to me all these kinds of things I'd always taken for granted that was a particular kind of fixed experience and what psychedelics do what meditation does what called intentional practices do so on as you kind of introduce wiggle room in that and you see that there are actually different kind of modes of experience there are different orientations to the the stream of consciousness so on and so forth and especially you mentioned the ineffable right where I think we're so accustomed to conflating the stream of consciousness that's always going on in our minds there's always kind of a narrative dialogue happening right and for so long I figured that's what my mind is but then you you kind of if you're lucky enough you to kind of unsteady that a bit and dig beneath it and you see that narration is just like one kind of way we have been filtering that it's been one way we've been expressing it and so you find there's all of this kind of space inside that that I was not aware that was there before and so when you mention these these life experiences having a child so on and so forth these are really powerful they're really salient they like you said they stand out to us they have a lot of contrast and one of the ways I think about that is they wind up kind of bursting through the the numbness that arises out of just operating in the default mode all the time when you're so familiar with the ways that you're processing experience that it's it's liberating to just be kind of thrust out of it for a second so more more or less right I'm trying to refer to in an economic context for example if you are someone whose entire life is kind of defined by a kind of low-level humming anxiety of not knowing if you're gonna meet next week's bills right that kind of anxiety is something that seeps its way into the way that you actually process experience it's kind of it's like you're wearing a pair of glasses and the tin to the fade is always kind of being fed into by all of the different inputs that are going on around you and so part of the project of the essay is to show or to call attention to economic conditions as just as kind of salient and important inputs to the way that we wind at processing experience as for example the the more traditional like if you won't go all the way back to Buddhism right Buddhism is talking about the you have attachment you have craving you have desire and these are things that are going on in your mind and if you kind of do the work and so on and so forth at least this is the Western Buddhist interpretation that's been individualized but there's a there's a much broader kind of spectrum of things that are feeding into subjectivity at any given moment and I think it it could do us a lot of good to start including economics in that discussion yeah that's a great answer so when it comes to the numbness I think that when it comes to the consciousness of capitalism turns into some kind of numbness and it's a theory that I've been working through and it's in my experience been a kind of numbness that then becomes anger and I think that very often there's not one emotion there's two emotions where you could think of it like a boiling tea kettle where heat goes into the tea kettle but then you get the whistle on the back end and so it's like I think the first law of thermodynamics like energy cannot be created or destroyed so you create numbness in one place but then you kind of then get the opposite in extreme anger and maybe a depression and you talk in this essay you show a chart from a New York Times article that shows the difference in deaths of despair between people who didn't go to college and people who were college grads presumably as a proxy for their place in the capitalist system but you know even among college grads like when I hang out with our fraternity brothers what I see almost consistently is a tragic discontent with what they're doing I was with a friend of ours about two months ago and he works for a big corporation and he said to me you know what our parents they just wanted us to be successful but never stopped to ask if we'd actually be happy and this was somebody who you would look at you'd say this guy's crushing it and he was all all he wanted was to not be in the game that he was playing I mean he was beginning to see that he was winning a game that wasn't even worth playing in the first place and he said you know what if I do really well in my job I get a 12% raise and I rise to a b-level partner two months faster and you know what if I don't do anything I get a 10% raise and it's two months later and to watch people just following the track which not only is it extremely hard to be financially strong following the track which is a problem but I think increasingly just dissatisfying you end up with all these people who are six figures in debt they have five degrees and it gets into what Graber saying where where we end up it's in this part of the economy that's filled with nihilism it's filled with numbness then that numbness becomes anger and more poignant ly to Graber people who are doing work that they know is meaningless yeah yeah it's so one of the one of the ways that I that I like to kind of frame that is that we are always generating exchange-value which so this goes all the way back to Karl Marx right Marx talks about how the working class is forced to commodify their time which is to say package up their time and sell it to somebody I'm in exchange for a wage that they can use to get what they need and this also goes back to when we talked about time inequality that when we are when we're commodifying our time what we're doing is engaging in projects and behaviors that have significant exchange value which in our case generally is money but the marks we called the use value but it's there's there's a partition a difference between generating exchange value and doing something that's inherently valuable something that you actually want to do for that thing as opposed to using it to generate enough exchange value to get something else gray bars greatest uh D is is really interesting because one of the reason that I really wanted to include it was because a lot of times we can kind of get cornered in the basic income conversation to frame it as a response to poverty and to say this is something that's gonna eradicate poverty there are way cheaper ways to eradicate poverty than than basic income yeah maybe not the negative income tax one good way but then a ubi for example but you know basic income for me it's about much much 01:0:0,039 --> 01:0:2,829 01:0:0,049 --> 01:0:5,809 much more than that it's about time and 01:0:2,819 --> 01:0:5,809 01:0:2,829 --> 01:0:6,810 so great all thing is he shows all of 01:0:5,799 --> 01:0:6,810 01:0:5,809 --> 01:0:9,570 these comfortably 01:0:6,800 --> 01:0:9,570 01:0:6,810 --> 01:0:11,850 class people who are undergoing what he 01:0:9,560 --> 01:0:11,850 01:0:9,570 --> 01:0:15,830 calls the spiritual violence of modern 01:0:11,840 --> 01:0:15,830 01:0:11,850 --> 01:0:18,750 work and it's kind of an anthropological 01:0:15,820 --> 01:0:18,750 01:0:15,830 --> 01:0:22,080 kind of shoving in your face that even 01:0:18,740 --> 01:0:22,080 01:0:18,750 --> 01:0:23,790 if we eradicate poverty like that we're 01:0:22,070 --> 01:0:23,790 01:0:22,080 --> 01:0:25,830 still in a prob there's still something 01:0:23,780 --> 01:0:25,830 01:0:23,790 --> 01:0:28,020 wrong going on here and the way he 01:0:25,820 --> 01:0:28,020 01:0:25,830 --> 01:0:29,760 phrases it I really like it he in the 01:0:28,010 --> 01:0:29,760 01:0:28,020 --> 01:0:31,890 introduction he says something like you 01:0:29,750 --> 01:0:31,890 01:0:29,760 --> 01:0:34,620 know I want this book to be an arrow 01:0:31,880 --> 01:0:34,620 01:0:31,890 --> 01:0:36,000 shot to the heart of civilization to 01:0:34,610 --> 01:0:36,000 01:0:34,620 --> 01:0:38,370 wake us up to the fact that there is 01:0:35,990 --> 01:0:38,370 01:0:36,000 --> 01:0:40,500 something horribly wrong with what we 01:0:38,360 --> 01:0:40,500 01:0:38,370 --> 01:0:42,270 are making ourselves and that that 01:0:40,490 --> 01:0:42,270 01:0:40,500 --> 01:0:44,250 phrase is so important to me what we are 01:0:42,260 --> 01:0:44,250 01:0:42,270 --> 01:0:46,530 making ourselves because that's showing 01:0:44,240 --> 01:0:46,530 01:0:44,250 --> 01:0:48,690 like listen we are participating in the 01:0:46,520 --> 01:0:48,690 01:0:46,530 --> 01:0:51,330 design of these systems that are then 01:0:48,680 --> 01:0:51,330 01:0:48,690 --> 01:0:52,890 creating us right like the you can apply 01:0:51,320 --> 01:0:52,890 01:0:51,330 --> 01:0:54,750 this logic to anything we create our 01:0:52,880 --> 01:0:54,750 01:0:52,890 --> 01:0:56,700 technologies and they create us we build 01:0:54,740 --> 01:0:56,700 01:0:54,750 --> 01:0:58,800 our schools and they build us we build 01:0:56,690 --> 01:0:58,800 01:0:56,700 --> 01:1:0,360 our cities they build us we are 01:0:58,790 --> 01:1:0,360 01:0:58,800 --> 01:1:2,340 especially in the kind of hyper 01:1:0,350 --> 01:1:2,340 01:1:0,360 --> 01:1:6,180 connected modern world today we are 01:1:2,330 --> 01:1:6,180 01:1:2,340 --> 01:1:8,400 always kind of creating ourselves and so 01:1:6,170 --> 01:1:8,400 01:1:6,180 --> 01:1:10,260 great thing is like listen we are doing 01:1:8,390 --> 01:1:10,260 01:1:8,400 --> 01:1:14,400 this we are waking up every day and 01:1:10,250 --> 01:1:14,400 01:1:10,260 --> 01:1:16,050 recreating capitalism and so he's trying 01:1:14,390 --> 01:1:16,050 01:1:14,400 --> 01:1:19,140 to show that this is not just about 01:1:16,040 --> 01:1:19,140 01:1:16,050 --> 01:1:21,450 poverty this is about the the ways of 01:1:19,130 --> 01:1:21,450 01:1:19,140 --> 01:1:24,270 living that people are assured into and 01:1:21,440 --> 01:1:24,270 01:1:21,450 --> 01:1:26,520 the default modes of consciousness that 01:1:24,260 --> 01:1:26,520 01:1:24,270 --> 01:1:28,830 prevail in those kind of structures of 01:1:26,510 --> 01:1:28,830 01:1:26,520 --> 01:1:30,840 work but we're doing it because very 01:1:28,820 --> 01:1:30,840 01:1:28,830 --> 01:1:33,930 often we need to it's it's the only kind 01:1:30,830 --> 01:1:33,930 01:1:30,840 --> 01:1:35,430 of route that is presented and unless 01:1:33,920 --> 01:1:35,430 01:1:33,930 --> 01:1:39,000 and this is another virtue I think a 01:1:35,420 --> 01:1:39,000 01:1:35,430 --> 01:1:42,750 basic income one of the reasons that we 01:1:38,990 --> 01:1:42,750 01:1:39,000 --> 01:1:44,490 are so kind of corralled into these ways 01:1:42,740 --> 01:1:44,490 01:1:42,750 --> 01:1:47,850 of living that are so obviously 01:1:44,480 --> 01:1:47,850 01:1:44,490 --> 01:1:50,250 spiritually detrimental is that the the 01:1:47,840 --> 01:1:50,250 01:1:47,850 --> 01:1:52,590 risk is so high to try something else 01:1:50,240 --> 01:1:52,590 01:1:50,250 --> 01:1:54,000 if you want to say I don't dig what 01:1:52,580 --> 01:1:54,000 01:1:52,590 --> 01:1:56,370 society's offering I'm gonna build 01:1:53,990 --> 01:1:56,370 01:1:54,000 --> 01:1:57,900 something else it takes a very very 01:1:56,360 --> 01:1:57,900 01:1:56,370 --> 01:1:59,970 certain kind of individual and very 01:1:57,890 --> 01:1:59,970 01:1:57,900 --> 01:2:2,310 often ate a lot of privilege in order to 01:1:59,960 --> 01:2:2,310 01:1:59,970 --> 01:2:4,410 act upon that with a basic income you're 01:2:2,300 --> 01:2:4,410 01:2:2,310 --> 01:2:7,920 kind of putting this floor that I think 01:2:4,400 --> 01:2:7,920 01:2:4,410 --> 01:2:9,870 lowers the threshold for experimental 01:2:7,910 --> 01:2:9,870 01:2:7,920 --> 01:2:12,090 behavior for exploratory behavior for 01:2:9,860 --> 01:2:12,090 01:2:9,870 --> 01:2:14,220 innovations at the most fundamental kind 01:2:12,080 --> 01:2:14,220 01:2:12,090 --> 01:2:16,980 of level of how we organize our lives 01:2:14,210 --> 01:2:16,980 01:2:14,220 --> 01:2:19,750 and how we we approach this whole you 01:2:16,970 --> 01:2:19,750 01:2:16,980 --> 01:2:21,790 know confounding thing of being alive 01:2:19,740 --> 01:2:21,790 01:2:19,750 --> 01:2:23,980 and that's and again when when I talked 01:2:21,780 --> 01:2:23,980 01:2:21,790 --> 01:2:25,630 about how can we how can we design 01:2:23,970 --> 01:2:25,630 01:2:23,980 --> 01:2:27,580 economic systems that function in 01:2:25,620 --> 01:2:27,580 01:2:25,630 --> 01:2:29,140 partnership with the enrichment of 01:2:27,570 --> 01:2:29,140 01:2:27,580 --> 01:2:30,820 subjective experience so that we don't 01:2:29,130 --> 01:2:30,820 01:2:29,140 --> 01:2:33,340 have to escape but this is like the 01:2:30,810 --> 01:2:33,340 01:2:30,820 --> 01:2:35,740 point of the system is to enrich our 01:2:33,330 --> 01:2:35,740 01:2:33,340 --> 01:2:39,160 lives this makes a lot of sense to me is 01:2:35,730 --> 01:2:39,160 01:2:35,740 --> 01:2:42,460 is reducing the risk at trying something 01:2:39,150 --> 01:2:42,460 01:2:39,160 --> 01:2:44,770 else reducing the risk at opting out of 01:2:42,450 --> 01:2:44,770 01:2:42,460 --> 01:2:47,080 exploitative relationships so for David 01:2:44,760 --> 01:2:47,080 01:2:44,770 --> 01:2:49,240 Graeber his kind of concluding sentiment 01:2:47,070 --> 01:2:49,240 01:2:47,080 --> 01:2:52,270 is that ubi functions to create a safe 01:2:49,230 --> 01:2:52,270 01:2:49,240 --> 01:2:53,830 word theory of social liberation that it 01:2:52,260 --> 01:2:53,830 01:2:52,270 --> 01:2:56,230 gives people a safe word so you can say 01:2:53,820 --> 01:2:56,230 01:2:53,830 --> 01:2:58,300 oranger you know whatever it is to to a 01:2:56,220 --> 01:2:58,300 01:2:56,230 --> 01:3:0,340 boss you can say orange to that way of 01:2:58,290 --> 01:3:0,340 01:2:58,300 --> 01:3:1,840 living now granted like you said it's 01:3:0,330 --> 01:3:1,840 01:3:0,340 --> 01:3:3,190 not like you can just live off your ubi 01:3:1,830 --> 01:3:3,190 01:3:1,840 --> 01:3:6,430 and be comfortable that's gonna be very 01:3:3,180 --> 01:3:6,430 01:3:3,190 --> 01:3:8,050 low but it it reduces that threshold and 01:3:6,420 --> 01:3:8,050 01:3:6,430 --> 01:3:9,490 I think increases the likelihood that 01:3:8,040 --> 01:3:9,490 01:3:8,050 --> 01:3:11,740 we're gonna see all kinds of 01:3:9,480 --> 01:3:11,740 01:3:9,490 --> 01:3:14,140 experimental behaviors than in long term 01:3:11,730 --> 01:3:14,140 01:3:11,740 --> 01:3:17,110 I think would be really healthy Oh Shawn 01:3:14,130 --> 01:3:17,110 01:3:14,140 --> 01:3:20,100 congratulations on your essay pleasure 01:3:17,100 --> 01:3:20,100 01:3:17,110 --> 01:3:20,100 David thank you
