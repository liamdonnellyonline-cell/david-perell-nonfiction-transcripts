Every single sentence that you produce  should not have existed anywhere else in the universe before. I find that to be a very inspiring idea. It's about structure. You want the structure  to be so graceful that you don't notice it. That's what we're doing when we're writing. We're polishing our ideas and then giving. And that's why so many opportunities come to writers. Amaze me. That's my first principle to the writers. Tell me something that I have no idea  about in a way that I'm gonna find surprising. I love this. This is very embodied feeling about  what good writing is. Blow me away, fire me up. We were talking last night about the  whole earth catalog and how in every edition you would try to piss off like  one fifth of the people. Talk about that. So, the idea is I was editing a magazine that was  about what I call um, unorthodox Conceptual news, a lot about ideas and um, I felt that we  were making our mark when one fifth of the people were kind of provoked by that to maybe  write in or say something, but I wanted to be sure that it was a different And Yeah. One fifth each issue. Yeah. And I'd kind of like rotate, not meaning that there was five of  them, but that I would just, so that they weren't the same overlapping group of people. And um,  and so, so, so, so if there was some, I wouldn't say outrage, but if there was some disturbance.  That would mean that we kind of had reached it. And if it wasn't until we were hearing nothing and  nobody was a little bit kind of, um, as I said, disturbed by it, then it was like, hmm, we didn't  really quite go far enough. 'cause we wanted to kind of, um, advance the, the concepts, advance  the conversation. And to do that, you have to, you have, you have to, there has to be  a little bit uncomfort in doing that. How do you validate that? I, I found for me,  the retreat to honesty, Is the thing. Like if, if you really have uncommon honesty about  it, that you're able to, to do that. And, um, so the, one of the things I do when  I'm writing is in that secondary past, not the Genesis past where you don't want to  have your editor going, but the secondary past where you begin to evaluate. I, is I question almost every single sentence and with two questions.  One is, um, do I really believe this? Um, and two, am I just sort of, is this a  phrase that would have occurred somewhere else? Like, ideally, every single sentence that you  produce... Should not have existed anywhere else in the universe before I think I think that  sentence I just said was probably like that Maybe I don't know but that's what would be my hope  that has really literally never been said before And so to do that one is it's like  do I really believe that am I just kind of parroting it and then to secondly? Am I saying it in a way? That has not been said before. And then when you're doing that  with that kind of honesty, you're likely to, to hit a bone. You're likely to hit something.  You're more likely to hit it than if you were just parroting something that has been said before. What does that honesty feel like? It feels great because you're being authentic,  but you're saying something that you, it's, it's a release. It's a, uh, it's a relief. It's,  um, It feels good and you can, at that moment, say, uh, that's me, that's, I am, I'm revealing  myself, I'm saying something, I'm contributing. So, so in all ways, it feels very good. And that may be some mark about whether or not, um, it is honest. We're talking about your career and you said, I wish I did more. That was in response to, um, your comment that, that there were some things I  had said or written that had been picked up by, um, by the culture. And that's what I wished I had  done more of, being able to succeed in that sense. Not that I had written more words. I've written  plenty of words. I don't, I don't want to write more words. I just want to write more words that  have, that land, that have some impact. And so, how do you do that? How do you write the words?  Well, what I know and what I have seen, the only way to do that is to write a lot of words. There's, there's, I mean, if we could get to the point where we only produce  great stuff, yes, of course, that's, that's the magic bullet. But the  only recipe that I have ever seen for writing great stuff has been to  write a lot of stuff. So how much of this is? Yes. I need to write more and  how much of this is I need to publish more. Here's the retreat to honesty.  Yeah. I don't like writing. I'm not a natural writer. I write reluctantly.  I'm a reluctant writer. I'm a born editor. I love editing. That first draft is just a killer for me.  Abysmal. Just, I just, I'm unhappy, I'm grumpy. Um, I procrastinate, I don't like to do it. And I  realized that when I'm doing it, I'm not a writer. Because here's the thing is, I  met Wired and at Whole Earth, I worked with writers and I  worked with some great writers who love to write, who have to write every day  or they're feeling uncomfortable, um, who write. In a, you know, um, in the way that I edit,  they, they, they like doing it and, um, I'm not one of those people and I don't write fast. I'm a very slow writer. I don't even type fast. And so, um, it's just, uh, an ordeal for  me to, to write. I love having written. That is really great. Way better than writing. Way  better than writing. And so, um, but once I get something down, then I can begin to kind of work  and then it's sort of, oh, now I can get into it. And so, I wish I would succeed more often.  And it's not a matter of writing more, I don't think. I think that I might have more  success or my writing might have more success when it veers to the practical and helpful. The metaphor that was coming to mind for me as you were talking about editing was pottery. Yes. Pottery wheel. So, you have something there but you're shaping it. Through contraction  and expansion. Where does the editing happen? Are you a computer editor, iPad? I'm migrating almost everything to, to the computer. Um, but I do at one stage, we'll  print things out and with a red pen, you know, but that's kind of pretty later on and just. Um, just to go through, um, because there's something about, um, seeing it in a different form  and that's helpful. Uh, the editing, the editing process, I just kind of go back and forth the  entire way. It's not like I just write and then I edit. It's write, edit. I usually like to re read  and edit the stuff the next day that I've written the day before, kind of go through it. So, um, so it's a back and forth dance the whole way. Talk to me about Marshall McLuhan, the patron saint of Wired. The thing about Marshall McLuhan, which I think he would approve of, is that I've  never read him, I've only heard what he said, which is his whole point. I tried reading  him, I was like, man, I'm just bouncing off. It hurts your head. Yeah, it's like, whoa.  I'd heard bits of McLuhan and his thesis, which is that, um, the medium that  you're writing has more influence on your thoughts than the actual content of  what's inside, which is a brilliant idea. And, um, but Louis Rossetto, who is, you  know, the principal co founder of WIRED, um, was a big fan of McLuhan. And he said, when we're doing our masthead, this old fashioned idea of the masthead  in a magazine, which is the credits, the, you know, the assignment, the roles, um, he said,  I wanted to, I wanted to have a Marshall McLuhan on the masthead, which we call him. And I like  instantly, I just said, he's our patron saint. And this was a joke in some ways, because if you  know anything about McLuhan, he was very Catholic. And so I thought, okay, he's going to be our  patron saint. And um, so he was, and that was sort of the, the homage to, um, the guy whom I  had not really read very much, but, um, it was kind of a very wired thing to do at the time. Yeah. Well, it's funny that you say it was a joke because when you talk about a lot of your  writing and your best ideas, you're like, Hey, they are jokes. That's where they, that's where  they're born from. It's in a state of goofiness and play. Those are the ideas that you should trust. And that was the fun part about Wired was that, um, we were making a magazine  that we wanted to read that did not exist. And so the audience for this magazine was, was,  was us making magazine that we wanted to read ourselves. So we're going to have these writers  make the magazine that we want to read. And so, um, we had total control and it was total  fun in terms of doing whatever we wanted to do. And there was no, at that time,  nobody else to, um, to ask permission for. And so, um, so they're having, having  fun. Um, was definitely part of the, part of the mix. And by the way, that  was my instructions to the writers. Most particularly in the tech world, most, um, writers,  newspaper writers were kind of, um, trained to, um, target their writing to like the 11th  grader or something like that kind of low bar. And I told the writers, look, okay, here's,  here's who you're writing to. You're writing to me and I am bored by most of what I read. You have to  amaze me. Come amaze me. Tell me something that I have no idea about in a way that I, that you're  going to, I'm going to find surprising. And if you mentioned DNA, you do not have to explain it. Yes. I know DNA. Yes. Okay, you know, I know whatever it is, I'm reading everything,  so you really have to amaze me. I love this. This is very embodied feeling  about what good writing is. You have to amaze me. Yeah, amaze me. Blow me away. Fire me up. That's, that's, that was our thing. Amaze me. That's my first principle to the writers. Is that something that you think about for yourself? So I would try to write up whatever I could rather than to write down. And  when I'm writing articles for Wired and stuff, I generally try to write up and by that, I  mean, um, not having to explain everything, but explaining enough, figuring, you know, my  friend, how much do you understand about chat GBT? Well, Right. You probably know some of it,  I don't have to introduce everything but there's some things and so, that kind of like, I'm  gonna be aiming there but it's gonna be slightly up rather than having to explain everything. One of the things that I was reflecting on your career that I just admire so much is you've just  been so connected to an internal joy and radiance and you haven't let yourself deviate from that. Right, right, right. So, So, there's a bit of  advice in the book that we might talk about. We're gonna talk about it. Which is  that, um, the thing that made you weird as a kid might make you great as an adult if  you don't lose it. So, so, yes. So, I have, um, really, really tried through my career not to  have a career or not to think of it as a career. To really, like, I'm. Unfortunately, my wife  complains, I'm not going to retire because there's never been any difference between what  I do for play and what I would do in my time off and what I do when I'm working. I mean,  they're identical. They're the same thing. There's, I mean, there's nothing. Like one  of the things I do is, um, I'll continue to write for Wired about one article a year. And what it is, is when I, when I have something that I don't know what I think about and  I don't know about it, I get an assignment and the assignment is me. Basically, being paid to figure  out what I think about something, to give me, and that's the principle reason why I write.  It's really not to communicate to other people. I write to find out what I think about it  because I'm not the kind of person who has an idea and then I'm going to sit down and  write it out. It's the opposite. I don't know what it is and I attempt to write what I  know and I write one sentence. And I realized, oh my gosh, I have no idea what I'm saying. This just doesn't make any sense. This reminds me, have you ever seen the series of sketches  from Picasso where he starts with a fairly complicated bowl, gets a little bit more  complicated and then eventually at the end he's left with the essence of the bowl?  I think that what's so illuminating about that is he can't get to the essence of the bowl  unless he goes through all the different stages. And so, so I sit down and then I said, I need to  go back and do some more interviews and whatever it is. And then I can, now I understand it.  Okay. And then I, then I write the next sentence, it's like, well, I, I really don't know what  this, this, this doesn't make any sense to me. And I go back and forth. And so this is, this is  this very painful process of me trying to write. And as I'm writing it. That's when I have the  idea, I get the idea literally in the act of writing. That act of writing it down, trying to  put it out, makes and gives me the idea. So it's like I didn't have the idea before, it's like I'm  like being channeled, I'm sort of like in some ways opening up, the writing is opening up this  space or process to allow the idea to be formed. In, uh, hands by, and so if I don't  write it, I won't have that idea. How much do you feel like you're, you're  writing or like the writing is almost coming out of you and you're not even in control? It, it, it's, yeah, both. Both. Yeah, there, there, there is a sense in which, where  did that come from? Because I didn't have that a minute before I started to write. It's like I'm writing, it's like sometimes people have it while they're  talking. You say something, it's like, huh, that was a good thing. I mean, saying it  generated it. And so, that's, so I write to think. So help me square these two  things. On one hand. You write when it's time to write, you're the reluctant writer. On the other hand, a lot of ideas emerge while you write. Right. So, what creates the impetus and the  momentum and the, the big bang of the Kevin Kelly writing sphere? How does that begin? So, like, okay, so, so something interesting comes along and, and, and I think I have a A good  nose for the editorial nose for what's new, but potentially important. And so I'm looking at this and I'm saying there's something important going  on and there's, we can talk about what those signs might be. But often there's new language or  it's causing other people to freak out or whatever it is. And so I'm saying, I'm paying attention  to that and saying, that's really interesting. I don't know. I don't know much about  it. I don't know what to think about it. Um, but I feel that this is going to be  really important. So I, I, I should, I, and, and so there's something about it that appeals  to me. So this is going to be an assignment and I, I'm going to figure this out, figure  out what I think about it, figure it out. If I have a take on it, figure it out. And. Then  I'll make that into a project, whether it's an article or whatever it is, or just a blog post.  It's just, I'm going to attend to this. And then that begins that process of I write something,  it's like, I don't know, that doesn't make any sense. I don't believe that or whatever. Okay, we're going around, um, talk to more people have, have been saying, Oh, there's,  there's something interesting. I just said, or I just wrote, I need to kind of, so there's  this investigation, the stance of a conversation with myself in some ways. I like the idea of a nose. And you have had an amazing  sense of like intellectual smell for a long time. Stay hungry, stay foolish, isn't that, doesn't  that come from the whole earth catalog? So, you begin there and you've always had this  nose. And I think that something you've been very good at is injecting yourself into what  you call senuses. And I find that to be a very inspiring idea. So, how has your nose interacted  with the environments that you've curated for yourself? It's funny because no one's really asked about that, but I think  that's really crucial. Um, I think I picked up this or I was attracted to Stuart Brand because  he's actually the OG of this. He is, his life is the Forrest Gump of our world because he has been  at the edge and the frontier and the forefront of almost most of the cultural movements. And um, You know, like in 1972, he wrote an article for Rolling Stone about  computer hackers, 72, it's like he, there was, he was, and it was, there was some machines in  the, excuse me, basement of Stanford and there were these long hair guys playing Star Wars. It's  like he saw it. He saw the. And then he kind of just decided to hang out at that, um, frontier. So I wrote a book called Out of Control that was published in 94. It was written late 80s  and early 90s. And I had a whole chapter on digital encrypted money, because I found those  guys really interesting talking about crypto, basically. But there wasn't blockchain.  There was other forms of encryption. And that was so much of a, um, Of a scene that  when we started Wired, I assigned, um, Steven Levy to kind of follow up and, and he eventually wrote  a whole book about that. So, um, so I like, um, you know, finding, identifying, looking for scene  uses and we'll explain what that is. And then, um, trying to hang around and seeing if. There's something I don't understand that I want to write about in order to understand it myself.  Talk about what a senior says. So a senior is a term that Brian Eno coined. It was his observation  that a lot of the great artists of the world, that their genius kind of flowered primarily.  Um, when they were in a group of others who were egging each other on, they were urging,  they were slightly competing, they were trying to outdo and show off to each other. They were, they were, the audience of their art was in some ways each other, their peers.  That structure produced really, really great. Um, works and that even people who were not,  or by themselves would not have been as great were amplified by being part of a, uh, of a  group. And he called that group a seniors. There was kind of like, it's like a  collective genius, the genius of a scene. And part of what you want to do is, um,  ideally you'd like to create these. And, and so I, I took Brian's idea and I  was kind of applying it broader to say, um, While there are scenicists beyond to say,  you know, the Paris in the 20s or whatever, um, and, and what would they be and maybe what  are some of the commonalities between them? And so I looked at things like the, um, Xerox park or the skunk works at Lockheed or camp  34 in Yosemite where all the climbing The outdoor climbing world and outdoor gear was  invented. There was a, there was a group of, um, undesirables who are hanging out, climbing all day  and inventing the world of, um, adventure sports. And so, um, I kind of made a stab at it, but it's  something going back to what we should do more of that I probably should have followed through.  Really done more work in writing on that could have been very helpful to people like, well,  how do I either find his seniors or make one? And some of the qualities that seniors share  are this sort of, there's a inside and outside, but it's a very permeable, it's much more  permeable than say, having a corporation. Where you have to, you're literally an employee  or not, it's kind of more binary. So they have a more, they do have an inside, but it's a porous  membrane in and out. And that's one of the differences between the seniors and say a company. Yeah. It's something we think a lot about with rite of passage. How do we curate writers  in a way that they can come together? And one of the things I'm getting  from what you're saying right now is the right blend of supportiveness and competition. I think we're a lot of the seniors that's happening right now is YouTube.  These little YouTube groups where someone has something they've discovered how to  modify, you know, a Harbor Freight, cheap Harbor Freight into something really cool. And then someone else sees that, that's a great idea. My friend did that. I'm going to modify  it a little bit more and I'll make my video and goes back out. And then two days later,  someone else's, and so you see this. I mean, the really good YouTubers are watching all  the other YouTubers in their little seniors. And so, but it's kind of invisible and I can talk  forever about YouTube because I think it's way, way under appreciated in terms of the  amplification and accelerant it's having on our culture. If you walk into a  bookstore, you can kind of see, oh, there are all the books and here's the range of  books and you can see there's lots of things over in the self help astrology, whatever it is. You get a map of it. There's no map for YouTube. There's no sense of how deep and how  vast what's going on. What's going on? There's no outside or easy look at it, it's not like  a magazine stand where you can kind of see, oh my gosh, there's lots of gun magazines. And  so, um, So, so we don't really appreciate it. But, but like, it's, it's like brain surgeons.  It's not like hobby. It's like brain surgeons who are posting or making videos of their  operations and they do a little innovation and all the other brain surgeons are watching  it and then they go and they try something their next time and they make a video of and post it. And there is this, this acceleration and speed at which this is happening. So there's a  lot of seniors in the YouTube verse. But it's basically invisible to most people. You have the concept of a thousand true fans. How has that impacted your work? I mean,  certainly there's books like Vanishing Asia where that was funded by obsessive, obsessive fans. Right. It was a Kickstarter funded. It was actually, I didn't learn, excuse me, I just  learned this recently, but it was the second biggest nonfiction book. Uh, funded in, in, in  Kickstarter history. It's so beautiful. It's, it's a, it's an overwhelmingly obsessive  book. Um, it's extravagant and, um. It's totally extravagant. Yes. It's extravagant and self indulgent, but that's what I think is great about A Thousand  True Fans. Yes. Is that we can be followers of the Kevin Kelly wins and basically surrender to  you and basically say we're huge fans of what you're doing and wherever you take us, we will go. The Thousand Truth Fans started off as a theory that I had, and it was something  that I was kind of like talking around to people for years, and then I kind of,  um, thought I should write this down. And then as soon as I began to write it down,  I had all these ideas. About it. And I said, okay, this is, this, this could be useful, but it  was, I was, it was before there was Kickstarter or patron. There wasn't any of the crowdfunding.  And I was saying, in theory, this should work. And then people like my friend, Jaron Lanier  were pretty critical of it saying, you know, it's not happening. The, the, the people who are now surviving or, or, or living off of a thousand true  fans, they started off with studios or publishers They had them and they moved there. There's no  organic growth of people who are indigenously starting with A Thousand True Fans and going up.  And I investigated around and there might've been one or two people, but it was kind of iffy whether  they actually had the help of another career. But since then, without a doubt, I mean, I  get emails all the time from people saying... Took that and I done it and it's  started me off and say substack is right. Largely built on this idea. Right. So, so, so by now it's no longer a theory. And again, I'll explain later on,  but I have not done the follow up book on this. Okay. Of, of, you know, the book, I still  have my original The piece and then the version that I rewrote for Tim Ferriss. Um,  and you, to be practical, to be helpful, a book about it should be written and I'll  explain why I haven't written it. So, one of the pieces of advice in this little book is, um,  don't be, don't aim to be the best, be the only. Of course, that's a classic Kevin Kelly trope. And to have a deadline because What a deadline prevents you from doing is  being perfect, so you have to be different. Well, there's another piece of advice for young  people, which is if at all possible, try to work on something or somewhere where  there's no name for what it is that you're doing, where you might have difficulty explaining to your  mother what it is, because that is the spot where the breakthroughs happen when there's no name. So it's like, it's like 10 years ago, you're kind of like you're doing podcasting. It's like, well,  it's kind of like radio, but it's not quite radio, it's sort of. And so, you're at the good spot.  And part of that is about not being the best, not aiming for the best, but to be the  only. And that is an incredibly high bar. That takes most of us, including me, most  of my life to arrive there, to figure out what that is. There may be some prodigies who  are born who very early on have some notion of what it is that they can do better than other  people, but most of us is going to take a long journey and that's why most successful people's  lives are kind of like, they're like detours, backtracking, hard rights, uh, dead ends. Um, because they're on this journey of kind of figuring out this really good thing and they  might arrive finally at the place where they're doing something that only they can do. So go back  to, to, to the book is that while as at Wired, I learned very early on that the hardest  Bye. Bye. One of the most difficult, it wasn't the most time consuming, but one of the  most difficult parts was headlining the stories, making the headlines and making the covers. And we'd have this tremendous intellectual battles and just, just, just purpose  in trying to extract out what the headlines and the covers was. So I said, well, we're doing this  backwards. Let's start with the covers and the headlines. And then make the article back. Let's  see what that is. What the, so, so let's, what are some of the most ideal, greatest covers we  could imagine for Wired and we'll make them happen if, you know, we'll say, is this possible? Is there any evidence for this? And so we would go back from that. That produced means that  we would have story ideas and then we'd have story assignments. And so, um, for writers,  we'd say. We're trying to pitch the story, trying to find a writer for it. Sometimes writers  come to us with stories, it goes both ways, but we would commission a lot of stories. And, um, one of the things I noticed about commissioning stories is I would have a  great idea often that I just couldn't sell to anybody. And they were, I'm not that interested,  or that's not a good idea, or meh, boring, you know, whatever. So, that's just normal  for things. Okay, here's some more ideas. And, um, but occasionally There would be, um,  an idea that I would want to come back to. I would say, you know, whatever, it was a year  later, I think that's a really great idea. We need, we need to do this. And I would try to  sell it again and nobody, and then it could maybe come back a third time. And I'd try to sell  it and it won't work. And then I would say, Hmm, okay, I see what's happening here. I think this is a great idea. Um, no one else wants to do  it. This is what I have to do. Okay. And those are often being my best pieces.  And, um, the thing about it is that at that point, there's no... I don't have to worry about  someone else coming along and do them because I've spent two years trying to give it away. Right. Marshall... And so, I would talk about the things I'm working on all the time in the hopes  that someone else will steal it and I don't have to write that one. Man, you really are lazy, huh?  Right. I don't have to write that one. I only want to write the things that only I can do. Right. And  that's why I haven't done the Thousand True Fans book is because somebody else... Could do that. I'm interested in where ideas come from, and in  this book, Excellent Advice for Living, you wrote this on your 68th birthday, the original...  Blog post that this came out of and you wrote 68 pieces of advice for your kids So tell me  about these Genesis stories for your books. So, um, again, this is sort of an inadvertent book  I didn't intend to write a book when I started I Was in the habit of writing down Mantras that  I liked that I that I could repeat to myself to change my behavior an example would be If I know I  have something in my household and I can't find it And then I look for it and I finally find it, the  little mantra that I began repeating to myself is, don't put it back where I found it, put  it back where I first looked for it. Or another piece is, um, when I get an invitation  to do something, to speak, to travel, to meet someone for coffee, to, um, you know, appear  somewhere, whatever it is, I always ask myself, um, would I do this if it was tomorrow morning  as a filter? And mostly it's like, no, you know, even though six months, it's going to be  tomorrow morning and then I'm going to say. You know, I wish I wasn't doing this. So, so  I asked myself, um, you know, would I do this tomorrow morning? That kind of immediacy filter.  And so I was writing these kinds of things down to help me condense that kind of, to help change my  own behavior. And I was realizing that, um, some of these things took me a long time to kind of  arrive at, and I wished I had known them earlier. And, um, as, And so in our family, with our kids,  um, we try to train them and model behavior rather than giving advice. Like we just weren't in advice  giving mode. So I never gave my kids advice. And um, uh, I just actually sent the book to my son  and I said, you know, What do you think? And he says, it's kind of weird because even though  you never said these things, we got the message. So, so, but I thought it would be useful to  them and others to have it written down so they could do what I do, which is kind of like have a  little mantra that would help them. And so I. I began writing these down and I  thought that I would do the Irish Hobbit thing of giving away presents on my  birthday and um, they went viral when they were shared to the family and then more than that. And so, I thought I'd do that again next year and I had more to say than I thought. It's funny, you have a, you have a line that it probably applies less to this  book, but Definitely applies to your other books that you should really write the  book after you do the speaking tour for this book. Yes, because you're constantly speaking and  refining over and over writing from conversation. Yeah And then every single time  that you're talking about hey, this is what's in the book Here's the core idea  now you have the essence and uh oh. The book was published a year ago. Yeah. No, uh,  it's absolutely 100 percent correct I mean if I knew I knew now about the book  I should really rewrite it and it'd be much better because now I know what it's about. So one of my books, The New Rules for the New Economy, which has been very overlooked.  You have a great article about that. I have an article. I started on an article and  that's what it was, is I was giving that talk. I love that article. I was giving that  as a talk for years and therefore I could, I wrote the book very, very fast because I'd  already been talking about it for several years. And so, um, So, that's another way to write  a book, is if you talk about it first and then write it. Is that something that you cultivate consciously? No. I think, um, so, I'm doing  a talk at South by Southwest on, um, the AI chatbots and generative art and I wrote  a little bit of it but it's really hard because, I mean, because I'm still thinking about it. I'm still figuring it out. I haven't given it. This is the first time I'm ever talking  about it, not at all ready for a book but maybe In a couple of years, it might be. But I have  to say one other thing which might be a little, what's the word I want, um,  radical for this conversation, um, I have promised myself that I'm not going  to do any other native books, books native. What does that mean? I think the center of the  culture has moved away from books to moving images, to video. That is the culture. My kids are  not reading books. Their friends are not reading books, they're watching YouTube, and that is now  the center of the culture. So, I wanted to do something that's native to that, and they can have  like a spin off book that comes out of it, but it's not, that's not the native thing, the native  thing that I want to be, I want to be present. In this arena where all the attention is, I  have a little media empire where we do, uh, we do newsletters, we do some podcasts for a  long time, we do a daily blog for 20 years, um, you know, I have books and stuff and social  media and YouTube channels and the only place where we see a growing audience. Is in YouTube. Uh, one thing that I've been thinking a lot about  spending time with you is you are remarkably calm for somebody who's so productive, Yeah. I, I, yeah, I am. Um, I don't know why, but yes, I am, um, um, able to be very  common. Calm is contagious. I wrote a blog every day for 20 years  and also I'm a reluctant writer. Yeah. How are those two things existing  in the same person? That to me feels like something that we need to just go at and figure  out what's happening there. That's magical. Well, so my daily blog, I was not writing it, it was  a cool tools blog. I have my own blog where I was writing, but that was not in a cool tools, recommendos, screen publishing, street use. I mean, there's so many different ones. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well,  most of those are more abundant now, but I have that technique in where I try to  write often. Actually, I have in my notion thing, I have probably a hundred things that  I've written but not published. Because, um, um, what's the word I want, um, because  I haven't gotten over that habit. I, I switched to trying to do daily art every  day and I was committed to that to kind of switch away from the, um, the text only. And so  also to, to learn new tools and, and skills. So, um, and where I'm hoping to go is to, to,  to release like a video every week. And so, I also have been recording tons and  tons of video, mostly in my making mode. But I'm been really hard, it's been really  difficult for me to gain enough abilities to edit to be able to do it because every time, I  don't know what it is, but my mind keeps forgetting the, it's like learning a language.  These softwares are so complicated that it's like learning a language and I haven't  gotten conversationally fluent enough to not even think about it. I can do that in photography, I don't even think about it, I can  do it almost blindfolded in a certain way. David McCullough has a line where he  says that learning to paint taught him how to write because writing and painting are both.  Stan... Seeing. And there are different ways of seeing. Right, right, right. How has the photography that you've done influenced your writing? One of the reasons why I photograph is to see, and that's why I draw is that you,  like particularly if you're drawing something real. You can't draw that without really, really  seeing it and most of the time you're spent is looking at the thing trying to comprehend it. Photography for me was an excuse to go see things and I use that way. It's like if I  hadn't had photography, I would not have traveled anywhere near the extent that I have  and that book is a reflection of the fact that I have. I've been almost everywhere in Asia  and I claim, and I'm waiting for someone to refute that I've been to more places in Asia than  anybody alive, or probably everybody who's lived. And so, um, and that photography was that kind  of propulsion, the excuse. To go out and spend all day looking and interacting and seeing. One thing that we were talking earlier about, you spend so much of your life trying to  figure out what your purpose is and sort of the meandering that you were talking about. Right. But I think that there's something about. The connectedness to what you are innately  drawn to and just trusting that and going with it. And you have that in spades. One of my bits of advice in the book is that in your 20s, you should spend a good  hunk of your time doing something that is. Obviously, not successful or success oriented,  that it's weird, crazy, unpredictable, unprofitable. Something people are going to mock  you for maybe. You might be mocked for, that is, um, silly and extravagant and dumb and  in any way as far from success as you can imagine. And that time and that stuff  that you do will become your touchstone. And the thing that you will go back to, to  generate your success later on. And so, so, so I'm a big believer in sabbaticals and Sabbaths  and taking time off and goofing off. What does that mean to you? Where you are, you have no  agenda for what you're doing other than the, the pleasure and the, the thing itself. I did a, um, a drawing. A piece of painting, uh, and posted it every day for a year.  There's no, I have no agenda. There was like, I'm doing it and posting it only because that  act of, of doing it was pleasurable and this book of 50 years of photography. I was doing  it, again, almost like a compulsion. There was no economic possible reason for doing it. There's no demand for, we need pictures of the disappearing cultures of  Asia. Nobody was saying that. You didn't hire McKinsey to do,  uh, there was two by two axis, this was the best, most efficient thing to do. Exactly. Exactly. So, this sort of, um, playfulness, generative creativity. That  I think people should do more of and I would recommend that for the pleasure and not  always be thinking about the productivity. Success part of it because you can do that  because I can guarantee you that it will be later on. It's, it's a weird thing  of the universe. It's like this other weird paradox of the universe that makes no  sense whatsoever, which is that the more you give. The more you get. Okay. Why? I don't  know. It doesn't make sense that the most selfish thing you can do is to be selfless. That if you really were aiming to get a lot, that you have to give away a lot. That's a  fundamental paradox, but that is so reliable. I mean, most of the major religions of the  world kind of based on that, that's utterly, you can count on it. And so, this is part of us,  like, you know, playing around, being generative, creating, even if it's just for  yourself, is by far, in the long view, the most selfish thing you could do. Stan. I mean, you could say writing is a form of giving at scale. Absolutely.  That's what we're doing when we're writing. We're polishing our ideas. And then,  Giving. Right. And that's why so many opportunities come to writers. I feel you have a duty to share your art, otherwise you're kind of cheating us with your life. Huh. A duty. A duty. You have a duty to write, to do art for yourself because that's only how  you're going to express your genius and that's, I mean, my, my goal is to increase learning  and to increase the options and opportunities so that everybody on the planet, born  and yet born, would have the opportunity to share their particular genius. And I think we often need technology to do that. So the little story that I  tell is imagine if Mozart had been born before there was the piano invented or the  symphony. He would have been And maybe he could make some kind of music and, you know, thousands  of years ago, but what a loss to us and to him if, um, he wasn't born after this was invented. And then, or Hitchcock born before there was cinema or Van Gogh before there was oil paints.  What a loss. And so, There is a Shakespeare somewhere today who was born, and she's waiting  for us to make the technology to allow her genius to be expressed and shared, and so we have a moral  obligation to keep increasing those choices and those possibilities, and that's what I am on, is  I feel a moral obligation to enable everybody. To have the chance to express their genius. How much of what you say is something that you've written down before? Such a good question. I would say a lot of it by now on certain subjects,  on certain subjects a lot, but... Clearly haven't written about the photography and the  writing, so gotta turn that one into a blog post. But I learned something from my  mentor and friend Stuart Brand. I have observed him for 40 years, in all kinds  of situations. And he had a particular quirk. So he was, invented the Hallworth catalog  and I'd been around, which was 50 years ago, I think. And I've been around multiple  times when people come up and say, you know, they want to talk about the Hallworth catalog. Changed their lives, whatever it is. And in those uncountable number of encounters and  times I've been around, I've never heard Stuart repeat himself about the whole of Kellogg. Is that  right? He'll explain it in a completely different way each time. Wow. And I've never heard him  repeat anything. He'll have a great line and yet when he says it, he'll try to make a new one. It may not be as good, but it'll be different. And so, part of what I try to do is not to repeat,  like, word for word, maybe the basic idea is, but not to just... Again, to try and reinterpret it  and, um, uh, I'm not always successful as Stuart cause I think he has a little quirk in his brain  that allows him to do that without much trouble. I had another friend who was inver I mean, he  was a, he couldn't help himself making puns and it was almost like a, a tick. And I think  Stuart has a little bit like a little tick where he's just like not gonna say the same thing again. Well, I've been thinking a lot about like a central question that great artists have and  then how that question actually manifests itself. So they're always orbiting around something but  it manifests itself in all these different ways. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take someone like Rembrandt. The  portrait, the way that light shines on the face. So, that's a central question that he's constantly  orbiting around, but the expression of that, the answers that he's bringing out are always  changing, always in flux, deeper and deeper every time trying to hit the next layer there. And most great artists kind of have some larger  theme and then we can recognize that. And in part, that's why they're kind of a great because  they're extreme in that way. So I actually think a greatness is kind of over overrated.  All the people that I know who are great, they're extremely great in certain  dimensions but that greatness... Always has a corresponding weakness and they're  great because they're extreme in that fashion, which also exposes this extreme weakness in  another area. And so, so there's a high price to pay for greatness. What price have you paid?  I'm not great. Yeah, you are. No, no, I'm, I'm, I'm absolutely not. I'm too calm to be great. It's sort of like, I'm, I'm much more balanced and, um, uh, not that extreme. What trade offs have you had to make in order to be Kevin Kelly? Oh man, that's such a good question. You're not going  to like this answer. But to be Kevin Kelly. I couldn't be great, you know, let me kind of define  great as something, you know, somebody who might be remembered for maybe a generation or two by. People outside their family. And so it's like, you know, in a generation two, no one will  remember my name or anything that I did. Okay. And so that's, so I'm not in that league  of what I would call great where, where you're going to be remembered for a generation later  by people outside of your family. And so to, um, to be me now, I surrendered that path towards  greatness because I just am not that extreme or fanatical obsessive about a larger thing. I am much more kind of like a gadfly with lots of little different things going around.  And so, that doesn't cohere into the kind of extremity that you need to be great. From the time that you've spent with people who are great, maybe great writers we  can focus on, do you think that they have a story inside of their head that they want to be  great figures and that that really drives them? Or what are some of the underlying  messages that they're telling themselves? Sometimes I think it's closer to obsessions  and things where, where, where they, they maybe might even recognize the cost to their  families or other things by this dedication to perfectionism or the next thing, or the  number of hours are putting into it. There might be, but they can't  help themselves. It's just like, you know, I got to do this. And oftentimes their  spouses might have understood that that was the, That was the bargain. We're going to go into the  room in seven hours. We won't see them. And that's just what it is. I've had the privilege, pleasure,  whatever you want to call it, of being around some billionaires and, and people that, whose names  will be remembered for, for many generations. And their greatness is something that  they're sort of grappling with right now, the consequences of that and the price  that they're paying for it still, um, and so, um, so yeah, look at that.  It's like, yeah, that's not what I want. What's a typical writing  session look like for you? So, in the generative phase, it's fairly short. You know, I can... Um, maybe go a couple of hours, maybe an hour and a half of writing before I get bored. Bored. Or, or  I, before I reach the limit of having something to say. Yeah. So, so I'm not, uh, let me, let me  distinguish it. Most of my writing is non fiction. Um, um, fiction is a different thing and  I have a limited experience in fiction. But fiction is different than. Most of the writing  that I do and I'm there, it's like, I just sort of, I reached the end of what I know or can say at  that moment, whether I need to research more or, um, it's too muddled and I am just like not  happy, whatever. The other writing component, the editing thing and improving  stuff, I can go much longer there. That's, um, You know, I, I, I, I tend to  have bigger blocks of time to work on that partly because I kind of feel like I have  to load the whole thing into the buffer, put the whole thing into the buffer and it's  in the buffer and I can start to going. And so that needs to kind of a bigger block of time. And how do you make space in your life in order to have that time? Oh, oh. So, I define, and that's another bit of advice, I defined, um, there's a difference  between being rich and being wealthy. The rich have a lot of money, the wealthy have time and  control of their time. I am one of the wealthiest people on the planet because I have total  control of my time and every day is different. And so I work best with deadlines. So I need  a deadline. Give me a deadline. You set your own deadline? I can set my own deadlines,  but I have to have a deadline. And, um, um, there's a great book called The Writer's Time.  Stuart Brand turned me on to it when he was writing his first book. And the major insight from  that was, look, the work, the work of creating anything, but particularly a book, is infinite. It's bottomless. The amount of, of work, energy, research, writing that could go into your book  is unlimited. You can always add more. So you can't manage the work, you can only manage your  time. So there was this idea that you say, like, basically, I'm not going to write the best book.  I'm going to write the best book I can in a year. Okay. So you're going to manage your time. And  so, and so deadlines do that for me, it's like, yeah, I'm going to do the best article I can  for the deadline. And the deadline is like, you know, it's, it's fantastic because  then after the deadline is done, I don't, I abandoned the book. I mean, that's,  books are abandoned as far as I can tell. And so, um, and so yeah, I can set my own  deadlines. And then, um, so I'm always looking forward to that moment when the first  draft is done and I can. Then, um, you know, work on these blocks of things and try and edit. How much do you think about structure in your writing? All the time. Why is it so important? In fact, that's what I kind of realized the  function of the magazine editor was, was primarily structure. That's all we talked about.  The magazine or individual pieces or both? No, no, no. Both. But most of the conversation about  a writer who is writing a story for an article, 95 percent of it was about structure. And that's the thing why? Because you want it to disappear. You want the structure to be so  graceful, intuitive, that you don't notice it. So, you notice structure when it's absent and you  notice it because like there's a jump, there's a logical hole, there's you're confused, um,  you're um, You're unsatisfied, you're distracted. All these things are happening because  of the lack of the right structure. And when you are kind of smoothly going on and  you're kind of like surprised but not confused and all these good stuff, that's because of great  structure. And if you read like John McPhee, he talks about this. All the time. Trash number four. Exactly. It's about structure and, and, and, and that, and it's really hard to do and you  really do need someone outside to help you if it's at all complicated. Great people, writers  like John can, can really do that himself. Um, and that's really what it's about.  And so I, yes, it's, it's about structure and most of the feedback I get. Uh, I gave as an editor was about structure and most of the feedback that  the editors give me is about structure. If you have the right structure, the words kind  of, it's not really about phrasing or other things. It's about structure. Talk to me about  enthusiasm. So I have a piece of advice that, you know, enthusiasm worth is worth 25 IQ points. And um, That's a little bit more also about optimism and positivity. But it also relates to your hiring advice. Yes. Hiring people who have that innate love for  whatever it is. Right. And not hiring so much around skills. Right. And you can teach that. That was born out of my experience at Wired. Okay, so Wired, we had a  digital side of, of Wired magazine and Wired, um, you know, created the, uh, click through  ad banner, the thing that's ubiquitous now. Um, and so we were You guys created that? Yes.  Wow. Yes, I'm sorry to say. That's pretty cool. We were on our way to do all kinds of other things if  we didn't have the failed IPO. But the thing was, is we were hiring people To develop the  web before just as the web was being invented. So there were no web developers. So we're hiring, um, so how do you hire? So we hire for attitude, aptitude, enthusiasm, and  then you train for skills. And you think that advice applies as well to writers? I do. Um, it was really interesting hiring like writers and editors. I  didn't really look at the writing. It was like, the conversations, it's like, it was about  ideas, it was about, again, for me, writing is, clear writing comes from clear thinking and  it was your ability to, to think and to have, be creative and to have ideas and to  structure your arguments, blah, blah, blah. Those were, were the important things. Talk to so many of our students and they're dejected because they think they missed the boat of online  writing. Mm. And I bring up something you wrote in 2014, You Are Not Too Late. Yeah. So, that little mantra is that um, in 20 years from now, certainly 30, but  even in 20 years from now, the big thing that everybody will be, have. That everybody will need, that everybody will talk about, does not exist today. So we  aren't going to be talking about Facebook, we aren't going to be talking about, um, even  Google. We aren't going to care about chat, GBT, we're going to care about something completely  different that hasn't been invented today. And that's going to be the biggest major thing,  and that's going to be the biggest company. And so it's going to be bigger than anything  we have today. And so you, whoever you are, have a chance to be that person inventing it,  creating it, writing about it and all those other things. And so, um, so you're not late. You, you're the, the biggest, you know, looking back, people will say, you know, in  20 years they'll say, you thought you had AI, you had nothing like AI, AI, this is AI we'll have  in 20 years. This is not chess. This is not AI. And so, looking back to now, they're gonna say,  you know, um, I wished, what they're gonna say is, I wished that I was alive and working in  2023 because that's when it all started. But hasn't all the content been created? There's nothing new to say? Everything has already been said but nobody was  listening, so we have to say it again. I think a lot about that with my teachers. I had  a high school physics teacher who was so impactful for me. You didn't come up with any of the ideas. It's great at communicating them in a different way. Right, right. Exactly.  So, there will be new things to say, 01:0:1,080 --> 01:0:6,840 but there's always new ways to say them and  that's the joy. And I think some of the best 01:0:6,840 --> 01:0:11,820 people that we appreciate the writers are doing  exactly that. There's always this tension between 01:0:11,820 --> 01:0:17,640 saying something that's familiar in a familiar  way or something we have familiarity with and 01:0:17,640 --> 01:0:21,300 yet we're saying in a new way and there's  something new and connecting it to the news. 01:0:21,300 --> 01:0:27,660 So, so there is, there is, there is always  that tension between. What we know and what we 01:0:27,660 --> 01:0:33,060 don't know and the genius is really in,  is connecting those two together. How 01:0:33,060 --> 01:0:35,580 consciously did you think about  marketing throughout your career? 01:0:35,580 --> 01:0:39,900 When I began, I didn't really  have a clue about marketing or 01:0:39,900 --> 01:0:45,840 know to the extent that it was important. Or any interest in it, and I think that is 01:0:45,840 --> 01:0:52,920 something that I have changed my mind about as I  went along. And um, you know, I think I had the 01:0:52,920 --> 01:1:1,080 kind of, a lot of people's aversion to sales and  selling. Um, I came to understand that in fact, 01:1:2,880 --> 01:1:9,840 packaging is a type of selling. Putting a  cover on a book is a kind of a marketing. 01:1:9,840 --> 01:1:16,260 Well, you love book covers. Exactly. And I, and  I, so I, I've come to understand that that is 01:1:16,260 --> 01:1:23,520 an inherent part of creation to being in that  communicating it and trying to share it is. 01:1:24,120 --> 01:1:31,860 Necessary and can be creative. And  so, um, I mean, we can talk specific 01:1:33,180 --> 01:1:39,480 things, um, but, but, but I have come to  appreciate it. I think Dan Pink wrote a book, 01:1:39,480 --> 01:1:44,040 um, to sell is to human. And, and I really kind of have, have come, 01:1:44,040 --> 01:1:50,040 have arrived there to understand that that is  really an essential element of being creative that 01:1:50,040 --> 01:1:57,180 you have to. Communicate in some way if you're  going to share it. You have the total right to 01:1:57,180 --> 01:2:3,300 create things and not share it. We can't demand  it, but I think there is, as I said, some duty. 01:2:3,300 --> 01:2:9,120 to, to share things. And if we are going to share  it, then, then how we structure it, how we market 01:2:9,120 --> 01:2:17,220 it is an essential element. And I, um, have  realized now going into something like a book or 01:2:17,220 --> 01:2:23,100 even an article that there is, that there's a half  of a, half the job is in creating it and there's 01:2:23,100 --> 01:2:29,820 another Which is sharing it and marketing it. And so, so I'm now prepared and understanding 01:2:29,820 --> 01:2:36,240 that when I finish writing the book and there's  the last sign off on the, on the final draft of 01:2:36,240 --> 01:2:41,340 the galley that I'm now half done. I've done  50 percent of the book. The other 50 percent 01:2:42,660 --> 01:2:52,020 is marketing it. And so, and I will spend probably  more time. In total hours than I did writing it. 01:2:52,020 --> 01:2:58,260 Wow. And that's what I'm going to sign  up for. And so, um, and that's because, 01:2:58,260 --> 01:3:5,040 and that's partly because there's been a change  in the, in the book publishing business. Okay. So 01:3:5,040 --> 01:3:9,000 the change is that, I mean, it's really weird  if you think about it, Random House Viking, 01:3:10,080 --> 01:3:18,180 um, books, uh, big publishers like that,  they do not have any names, any customers. 01:3:18,180 --> 01:3:23,940 Cause they sell to bookstores, so they don't  need, so they have no, this is the opposite of 01:3:23,940 --> 01:3:30,420 thousand true fans. They have no engagement with  their actual customers. Can you believe that? So 01:3:30,420 --> 01:3:34,440 here's the problem. The problem is people  are not buying books in bookstores anymore. 01:3:34,440 --> 01:3:39,720 So suddenly they're saying, what do we do? And so here's what, here's what's happening. 01:3:39,720 --> 01:3:46,620 Here's the practical advice to, to authors  is they. When you come to sell a book, 01:3:46,620 --> 01:3:52,020 if they want to know, are you bringing us your  audience? Are you bringing the audience to us? 01:3:52,800 --> 01:3:58,680 And your value to them, because they don't  have the audience. People aren't going to 01:3:58,680 --> 01:4:2,340 bookstores, that's who they were selling to. They don't, how are they going to sell? You have 01:4:2,340 --> 01:4:10,080 to bring the audience. To them as well. And that  means that you, that your own, if you have this, 01:4:10,080 --> 01:4:17,160 your own audience, then you got to do the work  of marketing to that audience. They'll help, 01:4:17,160 --> 01:4:22,860 but they're not really capable of it. So  basically I do all the marketing for my books. 01:4:24,420 --> 01:4:29,220 And I have a couple of things that I've been  doing that I've seen sell books. If you want to 01:4:29,220 --> 01:4:41,400 talk about that. Bring it on. So, uh, my book on,  uh, 2008, I can't remember what technology wants. 01:4:42,960 --> 01:4:55,680 I said, um, if, if you have a group that will  buy, um, 25 books, I think it was, and you're 01:4:55,680 --> 01:5:1,740 within a two hour drive from, in the Bay Area,  I'll come talk, I'll do a hour talk at your place. 01:5:3,720 --> 01:5:9,240 Buy 25 books. Which I thought was more than  most bookstores would sell at a book signing 01:5:10,500 --> 01:5:14,280 and I'll, um, come. And so I did that for a month, 01:5:15,960 --> 01:5:23,100 as many as I could fit into one month full time.  And it was absolutely fantastic because there was 01:5:23,100 --> 01:5:30,240 like a high school, there was like a church, there  was an architect's office, there was Google, there 01:5:30,240 --> 01:5:37,680 was, I mean, there was the whole range of people. And it was this never ending Variety of, you know, 01:5:37,680 --> 01:5:42,420 going on location, meeting people that I would  not have met. And it was just fabulous. And they 01:5:42,420 --> 01:5:47,400 had people, 25 people read a book and they would  often have people who read the book before, um, I 01:5:47,400 --> 01:5:54,180 got there, which was really great. Then I, on the  next book, I decided to widen it up by saying I 01:5:54,180 --> 01:6:0,900 would do a, um, uh, conference call that wasn't,  it was before Zoom, um, and it was limited, 01:6:0,900 --> 01:6:4,920 I think it was like Google meet or something. And they were limited to like, 10 people in total. 01:6:5,460 --> 01:6:11,340 So I said, if you had nine people purchase  a book, I'll spend an hour and we'll have 01:6:11,340 --> 01:6:16,800 a group chat with, with 10 people cause I  was a 10 and that was anywhere in the world. 01:6:17,940 --> 01:6:25,980 And so I did that for a month. And then the  other book I said, Oh, we'll do podcasts. 01:6:25,980 --> 01:6:34,020 If you have a podcast, I have a book and we'll  do a podcast anywhere. Um, this book has expanded 01:6:34,020 --> 01:6:39,780 to the same thing, which is, um, uh, if you  have a podcast with more than three episodes, 01:6:40,620 --> 01:6:47,040 I'll. You can sign up here and I'll be on your  podcast and I've done that for three months. 01:6:48,240 --> 01:6:56,280 I do six to eight a day and um, one after the  other and it's all self schedule on Calendly 01:6:57,300 --> 01:7:5,340 and I find that the podcast audience is very  intimate and they have time to go into the book. 01:7:5,340 --> 01:7:12,180 It's not like radio or TV where you have two  minutes and 15 seconds, it's like ridiculous and 01:7:12,180 --> 01:7:17,160 they're not your audience anyway. Yeah. They're  not going to buy books. Yeah. It's the podcasters 01:7:17,160 --> 01:7:24,600 and the newsletters and that kind of intimate, um,  personal take on it. So, I do all the marketing 01:7:24,600 --> 01:7:30,240 and I sign up for that and I think authors have  to understand that that is the landscape today. 01:7:30,960 --> 01:7:33,780 Talking about your relationship with fame, because I 01:7:33,780 --> 01:7:39,900 see two interesting things going on where you're  a well known guy and on the other hand, you have 01:7:39,900 --> 01:7:44,700 this quote where you say you really don't want  to be famous, read the biography of any famous 01:7:44,700 --> 01:7:51,420 person. So, something... Yeah. You have a way of  thinking about fame, a way of curating your, your 01:7:51,420 --> 01:7:55,680 reputation, so to speak, that allows you to thread the needle of this. 01:7:55,680 --> 01:8:1,860 Yeah. Again, you know, fame, like richness, it's  all very relative. Right. You know, it's like, uh, 01:8:1,860 --> 01:8:4,920 you know, if you're in Silicon Valley, what  does it take to be rich? It's like a pretty 01:8:4,920 --> 01:8:10,500 high number. Yeah. And it's the same kind of  thing. I'm around really famous people and 01:8:10,500 --> 01:8:16,260 so I'm not at all famous. I know what fame is. It is like where you're walking down the street 01:8:16,260 --> 01:8:19,680 and I mean, literally everybody knows  who you are and they want the selfie. 01:8:20,880 --> 01:8:29,760 Um, that's the kind of fame that you don't want.  And, um, it's a burden. It's like having a billion 01:8:29,760 --> 01:8:34,200 dollars. The thing I know about, again, about  billionaires is that you don't, I can, I can tell 01:8:34,200 --> 01:8:39,960 you right now, you do not want a billion dollars. Wow. You don't, because it's incredible burden. It 01:8:39,960 --> 01:8:44,880 takes over your life. You have to think about  it all the time. It just displaces all kinds 01:8:44,880 --> 01:8:50,220 of things. It's just not, it's not desirable  and you can't spend it anyway. So it's like, 01:8:50,220 --> 01:8:56,640 it's nice to have some kind of attention,  Notoriety. Notoriety, to be, to be respected. 01:8:58,020 --> 01:9:3,300 Um, and, and that's, that's, that's  nice, uh, and it can be, can be useful. 01:9:4,560 --> 01:9:11,820 Um, but I, you know, The way I handle it  is really to try and exploit the thing 01:9:11,820 --> 01:9:16,860 about which is an opportunity to meet people  either that I would not have ordinarily met 01:9:17,820 --> 01:9:24,000 or that I would enjoy. And so there's, it's an  opportunity and to be respectful of that, to, 01:9:24,000 --> 01:9:29,520 you know, I like to, people say they're  a fan, I want to know about them and, 01:9:29,520 --> 01:9:35,160 um, I mean, I generally do want to know about it. So, so. Um, there are times I, you know, in China, 01:9:35,160 --> 01:9:43,200 I have a lot more fame and I sometimes need  bodyguards there. Is that right? Yeah. Big 01:9:43,200 --> 01:9:51,180 festivals where there are a lot of my fans, but,  um, and that's, that's really weird because I, 01:9:51,780 --> 01:9:58,860 well, there's language barriers as well, but, but  I don't get to find out about them and have more 01:9:58,860 --> 01:10:5,460 of a symmetrical contact, but that's what you get. That's, I mean, so that's why I had some sense of like, well, I couldn't imagine that  being in the U. S. That would be terrible. You were talking about your writing earlier. When  you're writing, you're trying to say, is this true? Is this me? And on the other hand, every  idea is, is, is sort of this cross pollination. Yeah. Yeah. And those two  things operate in tension. Yeah. I may not see as much tension  there is, is, is that, um. I firmly believe that almost none of  our ideas are original or solo. So I reject entirely the trope of the lone genius,  okay? Because my investigation of the origins of science and innovation is  that simultaneous invention is the norm. And that's true, not just in science  and technology, but also in the arts. And so, um, so I think, um, that, that the  ideas and concepts and things are networks of things that are very tied to related stuff. And  that if, you know, if Einstein, which is true, had not done relatively, there was two other  people right behind him would have done so. And, you know, um, Alexander Graham  Bell who patented the telephone. Only won the patent because Alicia Gray filed  it on the same day, hours, just hours later. So these things are inevitable, including, you  know, like if you look at the weird things of suits with JK Rowling and Harry Potter and  Muggles and stuff, there were tons of writers who were talking about owl messengers  and Muggles and other kinds of stuff. That she claims she didn't read, and I believe  that, that these were just things that came up from other people. And so, and so in that  sense, yes, when we're being original, it's, uh, it's, it's just a tiny step. It's not wholly  disconnected from all the other things happening. Um, but we can still honor and respect that  little step, that little bit of addition. And so, um, someone else would  have come along and done it, but we're still going to reward that with a  copywriter monopoly temporarily in order to incent people to try and spend time doing it.  And so I believe that basically all ideas are coming from the commons and should return  to the commons as fast as possible. And that there should be a little tiny gap  where we try to incentivize people to spend more time doing it, but it should be as short as  possible. And the idea of extending copyright to like whatever it is, 99 years plus, this is crazy  because there's no incentive there. But you know, I think like 20 years or something, okay, that's  reasonable for a living artist, maybe for patents too, but maybe patents should be even shorter. But there's this idea that actually the commons, these ideas are being generated by the commons  And should return there as soon as possible. Something I like to, when I'm talking to Rite  of Passage students and they're struggling, I'll ask them, what kind of information are you  consuming? And you have a word of advice in here, cultivate an allergy to average. Right, right, right. So, if you want to be remarkable, read books. Everybody that I admire  in my life read more books than I do. Hmm. Okay. Great. And, and by the way, the best education you  can ever give your child is just to read to them. Well, so you had no TVs in the house? No TVs. Books everywhere? Yes. Books everywhere. And we did a lot of reading to them, um,  and my daughter, who is the most reader, is still reading ferociously, uh, not on social  media. So um, uh, so books and, and, and reading are important, but you really do want to, to um,  read widely and differently and, and, and a really good trick, by the way, for reading is to read. The authors that your favorite authors read, okay? That's a great way. So, you have  some favorite authors, read the people that they're reading and have read. That will get  you there. I have another friend whose passion is in reading the bestsellers of the past, which for  the most part we have completely forgotten about. Like, take a random year, like, I don't know,  1913 or whatever, and look at the bestseller lists. You'll recognize almost like none of  them. It's like, what happened there? They were like the best sellers. And so he'll go back  and read them. And they're, you know, peculiar, different, they're, there's something about them. They were good enough to be the bestseller then, but they're completely forgotten now. Which is  another lesson about aiming for the bestseller list is that, you know, that's true in movies  too. If you've seen the year by year on the Oscar movies and which ones win Oscars and which  ones we remember, they're not at all related. Hmm. Last question. Why has writing been worthy of devoting your life to  in the way you have? Whole Earth Catalog. Wired Magazine. All these books. All these blogs. Yeah. It's a great question and um, no one's asked me that before, but I  think because I did not set out to be a writer, there was never a goal in my life. I had a vision that once I wanted to be a photographer. I began to... Have something to say  or want to something to say. And mostly they were kind of like, I joke a little bit that my captions  got longer. All right. I was like, there's a lot more going on here. So for me, I think writing  was a way of sharing what I had learned. That wasn't enough. I think, as I said, it would  became a way for me. Um, to figure out what I thought and think, um, and then I would, and that  sharing part of it was sort of the, the obligation part of it, of, of sharing what I had learned  that also helped me to write and do it better, the feedback, what worked, what didn't work. So that sharing, I came to see as part of that process of learning how to think and write better  was. What do people respond to? Do they get it? Where was I successful or not? And so, for me,  it's a way of, um, of two things, accessing and helping me think and then two, to accomplish  my mission because I write about technology and stuff is to increase the number of options  and opportunities in the world so that everybody would have a chance to express their genius. What a beautiful answer. Thank you. Thank you.
