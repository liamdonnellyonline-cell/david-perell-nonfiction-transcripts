renee gerard will be remembered as one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century and to discuss his work i brought in my two favorite gerard scholars jonathan bai and luke burgess both of them have had their lives transformed by gerard's observations but both of them became frustrated with his prescriptions they liked his analysis of the world but they didn't exactly resonate with what he thought that we should do about it and so they have both spent some time completing gerard asking what should we actually do about his memetic theory and they each wrote books to answer that question luke burgess wrote one called wanting and jonathan bai wrote one called completing gerard and this is a conversation about those two books and we really get into the weeds of renee gerard unlike any conversation i've ever had about his work so i hope you enjoy it i want to start off with the difference between equality and sameness luke this is something that you talk a lot about in your book and to me or to almost anybody before they read gerard i think that they would see these things as synonyms but gerard points out that equality and sameness are actually different things and that sameness in particular can have some pretty catastrophic second-order effects talk about that yeah we tend to equate equality with sameness in the modern world and that can be a very dangerous thing equality the way that i use it in the book when i say that it is a good thing i'm talking about fundamental human dignity human rights equality of opportunity gerard says that there's a form of um of negative undifferentiation that is a positive thing it's it's the the form of um of equality in terms we see that we see that other people are like us that they're a human being um with with freedom and with dignity and we begin to identify with them so that that's the ground of empathy it's the ground of christian love we identify with the other and that's a positive thing it becomes negative on differentiation it becomes a source of conflict uh when we equate equality with sameness and we think that because we're different than the other people then something must inherently be wrong so it's almost like we can't hold um we can't we can't look at equality without always sort of running towards sameness and and and having a quality blend into we can't be equal yet different but that's the entire sort of ground of of modern societies that we've got to be able right to like co-exist in that way um in christian theology like the trinity is like the supreme example of this you know a a quality but difference in the three and the three persons of the trinity uh we haven't quite figured that out on a worldly uh societal level yet yeah i perhaps i'm a bit more pessimistic in my in my reading than luke and uh you know i think equality but different just always uh always brings up uh augustus in my mind as a first citizen first among equals or the animal animal farm quote of uh some some animals are equal but but uh some are more equal than others and so i think it's a really tricky concept what i definitely do agree with you luke is that gerard at least seems to think that a true and genuine form of compassion is if not only possible uh best exemplified between two equals and that there is something that is fundamentally good in what the christian revelation uh brought about that has led to modernity um however i and this is where maybe perhaps a more pessimistic reading comes in i think it's quite clear that gerrard takes this movement of equality justice transparency rationality as also as the a herald of apocalypse very violent apocalypse in some sense and you know let me read a quote from gerard's last book uh translated to english is battling to the end our world is both the worst it has ever been and the best it is said that uh more victims are killed but we also have to admit that more are saved than ever before everything is increasing some of which are marvelous and others dreadful and so i think that for gerard and i think this is what makes his philosophy of history really really interesting uh is that it is fundamentally ambivalent to the core that the currents which gerard identifies as being spawned from the christian revelation is both a a form of radical goodness uh but also uh it brings about if not a radical evil certainly worldly violence right and this this is in line with that matthew quote that uh gerard always likes to say where christ says you know i do not bring peace but a sword and i think perhaps this is what made gerard or one of the reasons that made gerard so interesting to engage uh in my philosophical developments because i studied under some very famous hegelians in our current age and what's really interesting about gerard is that i think gerard very loosely speaking would mostly agree with almost everything that hegel says about the descriptive change in history right the expansion of rationality this expansion of equality and rights but he would take a a a a very ambivalent tone towards that he would say yes hegel both what you defined is is is descriptively is correct your normative uh praise of that is also warranted but you are not seeing all the evil that that this equality brings about and and so and so yeah uh i i guess i i i wouldn't say i have a problem with with saying that equality is good but there's a there's a big asterisk huge asteroid somebody i think it was one of rene gerard's friends called him the most ambivalent of men right and that like he always sort of saw you know the good and the bad and everything and i think it's battling to the end or in one of his books he said that the christianity is the only religion that has basically sowed the seeds and foretold of its own demise in a sense yes it brought about its own device brought about its own demise right and it forced a choice um and one big question that i have is you know i think in in my reading that choice has to happen on um on an individual level right uh it's not going to happen on a societal level and in that sense gerard was very very pessimistic right um and sort of said we're ushering in the apocalypse and you know few will be saved kind of right which which echoes something that jesus said um i don't know man i mean maybe one of the only ways to uh avert the apocalypse is for all computer science students to double major in philosophy that might be the only like you did that might be uh one way to mix perhaps i think um i remember where that quote is from i think it's in book two and things hidden where he says that the christian revelation brought about its own demise specifically in its own success it became the last sort of aggressor right if the fundamental christian uh uh impetus for gerrard is to protect the victim uh a christianity through its own success and it's gaining worldly power became its uh uh sort of uh put that target on its own back and so and i i love that i never heard about that before that gerardo's the most ambivalent man uh uh sort of sort of but i totally agree with that and i think that's what makes him fascinating that's also what makes people like tocqueville i think really fascinating just being really being able to grapple with ambivalence and you know this also reminds me of a story that people tell about peter thiel where they say when working with teal it's almost like he has a mexican standoff in his head all the time and that he's always jumping from position to position um has the battle of lepanto going on in his head at all times i think that this this this idea that uh that you spoke about earlier jonathan that things have been the worst that they've ever been and the best that they've ever been can both be true you know um this is probably my favorite critique of stephen pinker's work that what pinker gets yes he's right about a lot of his very numerical claims about how the world is getting better in some ways but what he's missing is this potential energy that exists in the world he's really talking about the kinetic energy that's happening right now and so what how this applies to gerard is that luke you talk about how the opening lines of romeo and juliet are two houses both alike and dignity the montagues and the capulets they are the same that then leads to conflict and what you have there is a very gerardian idea of conflict is that two people are fighting over who's gonna get the last cup of coffee in the kitchen and all of a sudden you have the entire town that is just fighting and things can escalate very fast and so i think that the way that i square all these ideas together is now things can be apocalyptic because conflict can be global because we're all talking in the same globe yeah and perhaps uh again battling tien to the end is is where we should look at here this is his most pessimistic and final book um he he battling to the end is gerard's attempt of completing a military theorist one of the most most famous claushuits in the 19th century i believe and klausowitz's magnum opus on war began with or so gerard claims this apocalyptic insight that a politics or culture could no longer contain war and he saw the napoleon's uh total construct inscription the ability to sort of turn an entire nation into a military apparatus as ability to do so and so for gerard um he might agree that you know there's peace right now or maybe the last 30 years but you're exactly right david that there is a potential energy there not even just in the physical means that we have in the ability to destroy the world i.e nuclear weapons but also in the inability of culture to to to to stop war i think what gerard has in mind is that you know the iliad ends with the sentence uh and such was the burial of hector breaker of horses and so there were these and right and you can imagine how ridiculous that must be today if one of your generals dies both sides agree uh to take like 12 days off to honor this guy um there's a and again this goes back to the ambivalence of rationality there's there's some part about uh the sort of modern psyche that is not able to do these ritual practices to stop to halt the progress of war it is also not completely stop war by by doing sacrifice and pointing to a group and saying you know they're the radical evil once we spell them everything is going to be good and so i think for gerard these uh these this animosity between nations between war is lingering and built up and not released even between or between wars and he gives terrorism as a clear example uh yeah so it's an example of the of the escalation to extremes which is the phrase that is used over and over and over in that book and one of the reasons why gerard believes there will be an escalation to extremes is that in the christian revelation the scapegoat mechanism was kind of revealed in its fullest form so you know the scapegoat mechanism prior to that um was effective right in the sense that it was able to sort of bring some temporary form of peace and gerard is saying that now that the scapegoat mechanism has been revealed it's continuing to be revealed you know throughout the last 2000 years the scapegoat mechanism has sort of like lost its its power to bring to bring peace so we just need more and more and more and have to consume more and more victims it seems like we find a different victim every day and we no longer have the the means of the scapegoat mechanism available to us uh the way that society's you know a few thousand years ago did and what that means is like now the escalation like what what will prevent the escalation so in wanting i talk about is there going to be like a third innovation or a third invention um whatever that means because we've we've lost the scapegoat mechanism as a means to to put an end to the violence through violence of course right this doesn't mean that it's good it means that it was like a social technology that humans use to contain violence and i think probably the best example to what luke is saying here uh the one that gerard uses in violence and the sacred is out the story of otipus odipus right um once oedipus uh sort of accepts the throne and there is a plague i believe that ravishes thebes um you know there's a prophecy that it's because there's an uh ancestral uh a guy who killed his dad uh and then he's out there trying to find who it is of course it's him and once it is expelled there is a form of peace that that actually does uh fall onto thebes and to luke's point and this is another deep point of ambivalence in some sense that's radically evil because you're blaming this probably innocent victim whose incest has nothing to do with the the sort of chaos at all but on the other there's a radical worldly form of goodness there because he just needs to sacrifice one person and the whole city comes back to life now imagine today with our coronavirus how ridiculous it would be if we said you know what the coronavirus you know how it was caused it's because uh donald trump had sex with his mom uh and so once we once we put him in guantanamo bay you know the the plague would be that the coronavis would go away i mean that was the sort of argument that that uh at least you know if sophocles is uh is to be believed would have some marriage to dive into that example how much of this is i would say people wouldn't believe that as much because of some kind of scientific way of thinking as sort of the revelation of the scapegoat mechanism but my question for both of you is if you take the premise that the more people who know about the scapegoat uh the less it then works are then both of you doing a disservice to our ability to maintain a peaceful and orderly society by making gerard's ideas clear to the world i i i wrote a book that's gonna bring about the apocalypse man that's what i was going for um what was i gonna say um the i mean the coronavirus is a great example of this right i saw somebody on twitter who's joking about you know the solution to debt is to take all student loans and depend it on one guy and just to kill him right like um you know people people see this i don't know if the guy's ever read gerard but it's funny like what what he said is basically the scapegoat one of the things that i think about a lot with the coronavirus is that you know we can't um what what will happen right like the coronavirus uh we can't like watch it die we can't there's no like catharsis from uh just gradually eliminating the the coronavirus so i wonder like is there going to be a scapegoat for this i think we've been trying to find some but this this is kind of a new a new situation that i think you know the world is in um where we don't have like if this were if this were oedipus you know we might have just like blamed it on donald trump or something like that um and that worked back then but it's not as effective today as it was then yeah and maybe directly to answer your question david uh about about bringing the apocalypse or rather the charge of bringing about um i i believe so the first thing i'll say is that in some sense in the gerardian world of you the the apocalypse is imminent not that the conditions are there already but the christian revelation and the ex the exposure that it has and the knowledge that contains is always gonna grow um in fact his his line um i think it was book one and things hidden where he says that the more it's persecuted even the more that it will grow as well because the very act of persecution would be almost a proof of its truth and so in one answer to your question is that look this thing's already out there um and furthermore uh while it might be bringing worldly evil uh you know if one is a christian which i'm not but but luke is it is spreading the word of god in some sense and so again it's that radical ambivalence um the other thing that i think is quite relevant to this although it won't be satisfying to our listeners is that gerard so gerard in battling to the end basically walked back on two of his really important statements one is that he walked back on the statement that christianity is not a sacrificial religion maybe we can talk about that but what's more relevant is that he walked back against a second statement where he said that the mere knowledge of the scapegoat is enough to sort of uh pull people out of it and i think perhaps this is out of youthful naivete that in his earlier years earlier meaning like 50 and before um i felt like and even in things hidden he felt like he was doing a great service by simply revealing this mechanism however in balance the end and again this is where his pes late pessimism comes in it was clear to him that it was going to take a lot more than just reason for people to escape this yeah and i think that's where he's very sort of different than than pinker you know he said that's in somewhere it might be battling to the end actually i'm sure it's battling to the end he said that um the world is not a rational one it's a religious one right so so just like you know the enlightenment and and knowledge of the scapegoat mechanism is not going to prevent me from turning somebody into a scapegoat or participating in that process like it can happen and there's a certain level of and one of the reasons we're doing this is we we want to you know bring in like how does buddhist thought right like help us like connect the dots and complete gerard and that's why i think jonathan's book project is really important so there seems to be a really important role for humility um sort of like knowledge without virtue or knowledge without like humility or empty emptiness is something that you talk about in your book project jonathan i'm curious as to like how what's the relationship between knowledge and rationality um and i think it can actually be very dangerous when it's not accompanied by the let's let's call it some of the the spiritual development that needs to happen for humanity so luke i think that's a really interesting question about the about what is necessary for what gerard called conversion right and i think you'd agree with me that this gerardian conversion which is fundamentally a release from uh the most perverse forms of memetic desire is not necessarily a christian conversion um even though that there might be a lot of overlap in the venn diagram so i think the the quote that i have from gerard about the interplay between uh the intellectual process and the what is needed for conversion is this he says that no purely intellectual process and no experience of a purely philosophical nature uh can help overcome uh sort of that desire and i and i believe this point was even more hammered home to him uh in battling to the end now this is where i feel like a lot of the buddhist resource resources were interesting um and so maybe first i'll give a brief gloss of superficially how they're similar you know in things hidden book three which is one of the main books about psychology gerard tries to describe conversion and it's interesting because he uses an oriental tale that i believe comes come from buddhist uh cultures and he says that this time it is not a false but a genuine conversion the hero triumphs in defeat he triumphs because he's at the end of his resources for the first time he has to look his despair and his nothingness in the face but this look which he has dreaded which is the death of pride is his salvation the conclusions of all the novels are reminiscent of an oriental tale in which the hero is clinging by his fingertips the edge of a cliff exhausted the hero finally lets himself fall into the abyss he expects to smash against the rocks below but instead he is supported by the air the law of gravity is annulled and there's another obviously very uh superficial similarity uh between buddhism and gerard and that's their problematization of desire right and not just the problematization of a specific desire but almost all desire at least prima facie right and so here's what i here's the conclusion that i came to where i felt gerardian social theory was the social ass side of buddhist phenomenology and buddhist phenomenology delved deeper into this gerardian notion of pride which he considers and like many great theologians before him like augustine he considers the root of all sin so again to put it very simply i think the connection is this buddhist phenomenology identifies the root of our suffering in terms of three clashes there is aversion uh there is a sort of graf craving and then there is misknowledge and misknowledge is the core of of the three virgins and what we are miss knowing uh if you may if we may is the nature of phenomena and again to put it very simply the buddhists think that we believe that things exist intrinsically and that they're self-standing and maybe one good example i can give you is you know these air pods we know that there's like atoms flying in and out of it every time i move it yet we can still consider this one entity that goes through time now one may wonder well why is this the root of suffering at least according to one strand of interpretation it's the root of our suffering because once we apply those same ontological status of phenomenon to ourselves i.e we want ourselves to be all lasting to be self-standing that is where we need objects to pursue to both averse and say this is not me and to crave saying this object identifies me and and suddenly i imagine you can see where how we're getting close to the gerardian triangle of a mimetic of a mimetic rivalry and in fact my claim is that this buddhist triangle of misknowledge craving and diversion is is simply the phenomenological side of the gerardian triangle which is a social triangle that has mediation that is linked to misknowledge because it's fundamentally based on pride and a desire to be metaphysically autonomous or or as you described it uh self-sufficient and then the positive phase of mediation is related to craving to finding a model and desiring what the model desires and there's also a negative phase right of of of a rivalry where i desire things exactly what the rival does not have or or is not and that relates to aversion and so maybe to sum it all up because i've been talking too long already the buddhists i think tackle the fundamental phenomenological problem that gerard does not put enough effort to resolve and they also provide meditative uh sort of practices to correct our phenomenological error now one more point here is that i don't think we necessarily need to go into uh sort of the orient to find a satisfying solution to gerard um we might also look at a thinker like hegel and the critique for gerard and this is my biggest critique of gerard is that he does not spend enough time interrogating this notion of being of which desire is aimed at and the way that he takes being is that being has to be this grandiose you know i i want to be like god is just a type of grandiosity and i think even if he looked at hegel's phenomenology for example where where being takes a journey and evolves he would find many resources to correct our desire so so in the um thank you for that jonathan so in the in the buddhist in buddhist phenomenology would a desire for being be um something to rid oneself of as part of the process of conversion yeah so the desire for the specific type of being that it described would indeed be right to think of oneself as intrinsically existent and again that ontological status has very practical aims you know if i want to think of myself as living forever uh you know maybe i i have to build empires to sort of prove that and i want if i want to think of myself as you know independent of causes maybe i want i need slaves or servants around me such that my uh uh my desires are the primary ones that thick takes the world around me so indeed that mode of phenomenology mode of being is to be rid um but but it's not to say nothing exists whatsoever just them and again this gets very complicated just the mode of the existence changes it becomes what is called emptiness or on the positive side dependent origination and basically it's to recognize the uh uh the inter-dividual as gerard says it's the pursuit of mode of being that is inherently uh connected and uh you know the classic there's a there's a buddhist uh i don't know if this metaphor is the right word here called the net of indra and it's this uh sort of metaphor that is able to describe that this aims to describe how the buddhist ontology and worldview is is based and it's this infinite series of mirrors that all reflect off of each other that's the net of indra and and i think that is also the uh ontology that we're supposed to shift to in some sense uh this sort of interconnectedness that is both called emptiness as well as dependent origination interesting so i mean i'm going to respond with i there's so many similarities between this way of thinking that i can connect to the kind of the christian vision of it what's fascinating and this i'm so excited to have this conversation you know my book and your book project have similar structures in that the first half sort of attempt to present um memetic theory and gerard's thought in our own words and faithful to the thinking itself and then in the second part we're both trying in our own ways to complete it right and to make sense like what does this mean for me what does this mean for the world i take a christian perspective and you take a buddhist one um and i think we can sort of start to bring them together that's what's really cool about this i'm i'm fast i have to ask you because i i think that we're saying a lot of the same things why did you choose to use dante as the as the main image right throughout your website uh talking about gerard and buddhism you use this sort of great christian poet because dante for me is like the symbol of this transformation of desire that that reordering of desire that has to happen so what's the connection with dante yeah well first of all i i'm not surprised at all that did you find a lot of similarities to the prescriptions that you provide uh if not because you know by hopefully pursuing this fundamental link by connecting christian pride one of my favorite passages in in in the city of god uh by augustine is this exegesis he did he does on this one line about pride but i wish i won't go into but my ambitions for this project and it's uncompleted ironically uh still it's still a manuscript in the work is to connect this christian notion of pride with this buddhist notion of intrinsic existence and because these two central concepts are the core of their respective metaphysics as well as as well as ethical theory i'm not surprised at all that that the other parts that flow out of this uh you find so much similarity with for example compassion and christian love um but to answer your question directly i i used don well the only part where i explicitly mentioned dante in the manuscript is i believe in the beginning where i described gerard as my dante you know i had this uh hopefully like or i think quite kept clever line where i said uh something like you know i began this book project when i was 20 in the midway of our journey in college for i found myself in a dark place uh in life i had lost the path that does not stray which is obviously the beginning to the inferno uh and um and so gerard really rescued me from to not connotate something more extreme than i intend like pathologies that i was extremely prideful now that i'm not now uh and extremely uh not humble and just just directed by by metaphysical and medicine desire in a very perverse way that was existentially uh insufferable to myself and so so gerard helped me avoid the most extreme manifestations of those sort of medic pathologies he also helped me purge their more subtle forms however just like uh virgil led dante and and my analysis was that sort of gerard was my virgil um he was not obviously in in the in the uh in the pa in paradise the sort of last part of dante's trilogy virgil has to leave dante right virgil is still belongs to limbo and he can't lead uh dante to a final servation and so that there's also an implicit critique there that gerard and i'm sure this is why you part of the reason why you wrote you wrote your book as well is just not satisfying in his normative prescriptions at all right and and in one interview he they asked him like what do we do and gerard is like what do you mean and you know like that's not the project i'm trying to pursue here and in fact he said that it's up to people uh uh it's up to uh sort of other people analyze this work and figure out what to do and so i'm sorry this is a long really long wounded way to answer your question but i use the imagery of of of dante specifically virgil because in some sense virgil is like my uh as gerard is like my virgil where he's able to perfectly uh uh expose the nature of evil but i i just feel like he's very lacking in helping me try to get to the final salvation yeah i felt the same way and everybody wants prescriptions but i kind of feel like gerard right like he just kind of like leaned back in his chair and took a big drag on a cigarette and he's like you know um it's up to for to you guys to figure out right to work out your own salvation kind of um yeah i mean i i actually thought about making incorporating dante into wanting and i was like this would get way too complicated um so i'm just going to leave that out of there but i love how you use the imagery right it's the images say a lot so one way that i think the this can be understood from a from a christian perspective is this kind of desire for for being works itself out in um in a relationship in a relational context right in a relationship with the one who is the fullness of being as opposed to trying to make ourselves into gods as like harare says at the end of sapiens and homo deus like humanity is trying to upgrade themselves into gods um so you know it's it's that humility right understanding that we're we're relational and that we don't possess like metaphysical autonomy and independence we subsist um in in christian theology in god and we only sort of as augustine said right our hearts are restless until they rest in you so it's that search for a relationship um not knowledge um a relationship which gives the knowledge um so those those two things are are related right like love and knowledge are highly highly related things or really can't be perfect knowledge of another without love for the other and vice versa so the reason why i think dante was such a beautiful image to use in your work and why he resonates with me is like that that embodies what i believe is kind of the the way out it's the journey that dante took at the beginning of the inferno those three beasts the she-wolf and the other two i forget what they were exactly a leopard or something those those sort of those represent disordered desires and then that then the process the journey that he went on was not one of ridding himself of desires he rid himself of the sinful desires the rivalrous desires the pride and reordered everything towards ultimately love right so where he you know you get to the end of the book it's actually the end quote and wanting is is straight from dante and it's like you know by by now you know i see the the desire and the love that has moved the sun and the stars so it's the process of reordering desires not not ridding himself of desire um and in fact you know gerard was not the the model for me either gerard got me started but he didn't sort of he doesn't serve as the kind of uh like sort of supreme ma for a christian of course christ right um but because we're humans and we rely on sort of incarnate models are always more powerful to us uh i think the saints right so like the the journey that i sort of um the way that i think that the people in the world that i think from a christian perspective that have exemplified the way out is is the journey of a saint basically saintly mod and i think you had you sort of had hinted at that near the end of your book too um you said you weren't quite satisfied with thinking of gerard as just this pacifist like you just have to disengage with the world and you said you know maybe there is like a better model for this and i think you even use the word like maybe it's some form of saintliness uh and and i i think that that's right um from what i understand gerard you know some people have even just described gerard as having a certain amount of holiness right i think he was a very virtuous person um but we with lacking those positive models um and gerard says like like positive models of positive models and shared models are becoming invisible in the modern world like it's really hard to find to them anymore and i think that that creates a situation where everybody is just an internal mediator to everybody else gerard says like the modern world is is the world of internal mediation right like like lacking a transcendent model and i sort of hint at and wanting like that's creating a relatively dangerous condition yeah so luke i i have a lot of questions to ask about uh your work and a lot of a lot of points to learn from especially on the part two the prescription side um but i'll just make one comment first about this fundamental connection that i think you drew which i think is the right one between uh the buddhism at least the one that i've presented as well as the christian thought and not just gerard although obviously derived specifically and it's it's this notion of pride right i believe in desiring to see the novel gerard identifies the fundamental reason that we have metaphysical desire for being is pride and maybe pride is is something that we've always had but it's been inflamed in modernity when quote unquote god has died and we have killed him right that we think that this is something that humans should be able to have and what always struck me and this is the piece of christian theology that uh that i've been most influenced by i think it was book 15 of of city of god in augustine which does this exegesis on this one line i think it's uh though casted them down when they raised themselves up and augustine's point here is that the sentence is structured in a very interesting way it's not that obviously though here is god it's not that god it's not that you know uh people rise themselves up it's not the greek view right where the gods pile pride upon uh the ones who they wish to see fall the gods do not actively sort of put you down because they're jealous in the christian god at least um however what's interesting is that in the christian world view so in the greek world for you it's that you get more and more prideful you get too close to zeus he zaps you with his lightning bolts right in the christian world view and this is where augustine's point is that that word when is very important is that it's simultaneous the very raising of oneself is the debasing of oneself because it closes oneself off to god now as a secular uh to interpret interpreted secularly we can say we close ourselves off to others and that's still debasement right and so so and augustine concludes that fundamentally there's something in humility that exalts and in pride that debases and that's something that that is just tremendously uh influenced me but luke i i i would love to i would love to hear you in your own words describe your recommendations in in part two um especially this reordering of desires i find it extremely fascinating and so i'm just curious you know um i showed a bit about uh my incomplete thoughts in the manuscript and what to do here um but i'm curious what what is the prescription that that you have for people from people who are trapped in this uh memetic swamp um you know i i honestly don't so i i share some things in the book that i've tried to work out in my own life and i i hesitate to call them prescriptions at all for for other people right because i there's a wide variety of people that are grappling with these things not all of them are christians um that's why i love having a conversation like this it's like what are what's the common ground so i used intentionally ambiguous language um so that people could connect it to their own lives and and and where they're at i think that gerard's like conversion is a word that we keep coming back to in this conversation and it's a really important word in gerard i mean in fact he saw in what he called the novelistic conversion um after he had finished basically writing deceit desire in the novel he he rewrote it he well definitely the last chapter is it's very different than the rest of the book um and he saw the the conversion of the novelist which one doesn't need to be religious to see that there is some type of conversion taking place and i don't know why like this should be obvious right like i don't understand why conversion only has to be spoken of in religious or christian theology like there clearly is such a thing as a as a secular conversion i'm an intellectual conversion um and most importantly like a conversion just like somebody who's prideful and just kind of a you know like a bad person to somebody who becomes you know more loving husband father and human being somebody who's empty i mean that's clearly a process of conversion um and different religious traditions just explain what's going on in different ways so clearly gerard saw what happened to the novelists and deceit and desire in the novel as um what's the word i'm looking for as as like a mirror to a to a spiritual conversion that he was undergoing himself at that very time so i think the one of the the goals i mean the problem with a prescription is this uh nobody can just read a book and have a um or or be prescribed like a like a five-step program to you know to to salvation or something like that right this is like a form of gnosticism uh which i'm totally trying to avoid it's why i can't stand like every every podcast that i go on quite frankly is like well what do we do what what are the three to five steps it's like it doesn't work like that because what this is actually about at the end of the day is about some process of conversion and often for people in their life that comes from hitting rock bottom uh it comes from just like experiencing their their own sort of um creaturelyness and sort of like weakness and and and emptiness and and realizing um the folly that you know was driving them largely due to pride and this this is exactly what gerard recognized in the great novelist like they came face to face with their own pride and in a certain sense they saw how like silly and vain and ridiculous this project that they had worked up in their minds was so you know the i think there are certain things that there are like preambles to to a type of that i think we can talk about in in somewhat of a prescriptive way um almost like like preconditions or like are an openness to change and some of the things i talk about in the book um you and i actually i think if i'm not mistaken we're both introduced to gerard in the context of a retreat so so for me this was a silent retreat in the hills of rome where the retreat director unbeknownst to me was a gerardian and he made me read the eighth chapter of john over and over and over and over again that the women caught in adultery until i finally started to see some of the memetic stuff that was happening in so that's one prescription that i give in the book is basically just like we need to in a certain sense and let's let's stop after this right could be before because we could just keep going because you talk about something very similar there does at some level have to be a disengagement uh some space created in order to re-engage and i think that's really really important in order to be able to step back and and get some perspective and be able to examine ourselves and you describe sort of at the end of your book project like hey i'm not done yet but i'm ready to sort of like i'm gonna i'm gonna go forward and there's a there's an iterative process right now we probably bring hegel into this i don't know if it's a dialectical process or not but there is this process of contemplation and action and and one sort of informs the other and that's a really really important concept to understand that's this is um this is true in buddhist thought and in christian thought the relationship between act action and contemplation you know this idea of the shortcomings of is something that i've been trying to grapple with because i think that two things are true and i'm trying to square how they can both be true at the same time and the first is that a teacher or a writer cannot just tell you how to live your life they cannot put words on a page then you take those words do exactly what they tell you to do and there will be answers but also all of us have had teachers in our lives who have pushed us in a direction that has allowed us to discover things right right here it's gerard right all three of us have read gerard been moved by his work then interpret it interpreted it in our own ways and the two of you basically said okay now we need to complete this and i think that with these really difficult deep ideas they can only be accessed through metaphor and the metaphor that i use to work through this is the map and the territory what a teacher can do is they can give you a really good map high resolution they can allow you to zoom in and out like google maps but we all have looked at a map of a city that we're going to and then actually gotten on the ground and had that map be exactly the same as what we saw but also entirely different and once we went into the map we saw the world through effort and through walking with footsteps through actually touching the contours of cobblestone we then began to see the complexity of the world and you can only discover the territory for yourself but what a good prescription does is it gives you a good map that then you can use to navigate that territory i i couldn't agree with that more and the reason i love that metaphor so much is because you're both highlighting the limitations of the map right even the best map possible is not a substitute for experience in your case the territory um but you're also highlighting the power of the mac having a there are really bad maps right like i i remember those apple maps that those japanese people followed and drove into the sea or something um but and i think this ties back to luke's point as well um where gerard even after going through his intellectual conversion right changing the the last chapter of desire to see the novel it took him being close to death uh sort of having cancer i think it was like a year or two after like immediately after for him to actually have a radical change and so david in the analogy of your metaphor the map there might have been the uh dossiers of the world and and all those authors that gerard had uh had read and however the territory was was a necessity for drought to go through and so you know the thinker i'd like to bring into uh all these things is uh is kierkegaard uh and kierkegaard obviously another christian theologian had a strong distaste for the enlightenment's hubris in what it thought reason could do uh and in kierkegaard i think it was in unscientific postscript talked about the necessity of subjective truth for example love and that there was his claim was that there were certain things that each generation must learn by themselves i.e the pain of losing in love you know the the the brilliance of love and it's its highest in its best moments and and so i think uh maybe to to put at this guardian terms that there is a form of objective knowledge that can be communicates a reason that helps us make sense of our subjective experience but at the end of the day i think both are are necessitated and required to produce this conversion which is why that i feel like gerard was so pessimistic at the end because it does require a lot of fluke as you say uh preconditions yeah it's this reminds me of um you know true truth can be objective but it's like beauty but it's experienced subjectively and there needs to be some kind of like um sort of sort of coming together or co-naturality or else things remain abstract and unreal um john henry newman used this phrase unreal words as he was describing the way that a lot of christians like throw out language like heaven and hell and that and grace and like most people have no existential contact with what these words mean um there's no co-naturality there and that's the challenge i think with gerard too like we have these discussions and um he provides like a map but you have to go there like yet you have to actually like go to the city and start walking around keeping these things in mind and that's where i think the map is really important um and then you sort of come up against things you come up against structures the way that you know one thing that i think that here's a limitation of is that i don't i think there are some prescriptions that apply to all all people just because we're human and we share a human nature um but our journeys are so so so different right depending on the culture we grew up in part of the world where so that's why people need to grapple with this stuff and and work through it and share their experiences but i think i think david's you know metaphor of the map was was spot on and um we're all kind of we're kind of constructing them gerard didn't complete the map you know and we're all trying to we're both filling in the map and going around in the city at the same time and that's a really cool thing yeah and i think again to tie back to christianity um one thing one connection that i made in in your last uh discussion luke is actually between luther and what we're talking about now where luther had the the the three onlys right uh it's it's through uh i i think it's it's through uh i think it's the grace only are we saved through faith only can it be open to grace and through reading scripture only can it be open to to faith uh or no i'm sorry i think it's face grace in scripture um and i think that's another great example of map as well right it's only by reading scripture and putting in the time can you be even open to the grace of god and open to these subjective experiences however that is a that isn't necessary but not sufficient condition one may very well read as much scripture as they want but not be blessed by the grace of one of these experiences that converts them uh in a radical way and luke maybe this is a good time for for you to share a a a few more of your uh maps if you will on the prescriptive side you talked about on anti-mimetic because luke your sub stack is called anti-medic i think that that's one that all three of us can orbit around well and the place that i want to begin here do we need to be anti-memetic in that we can only look towards god and imitate thing one thing two is do we need to be anti-memetic towards people in our lives but we can have external mediators such as social media influencers who are sort of outside our sphere or three and in my reading of gerard this is impossible but i want to pose it as a potential solution do we need to try to escape external desire and find our own desires from within i think the the i mean in gerardian terms the third is impossible right and the paradox is that you know when i use the word anti-memetic i don't mean freeing ourselves from mimesis i'm speaking of destructive mimesis so those were three different things why don't we just just tackle them so the the first one um you might have to remind me but in terms of relationships being anti-mimetic in relationships one way to be anti-mimetic is let's talk about like a loving relationship non-rivalrous love is anti-mimetic in the sense in in the best possible sense and that it's not um i mean people that are in relationships can be in memetic relationships all the time like a ghoulian talks about this uh in in some of his books right he diagnoses like couples even husband and wife that are memetic with each other so developing some anti-mimetic aspects to that relationship where you don't you're not like actually competing with each other for power and status and respect and all of those things that's one way to be anti-memetic but at the same time like for every for every anti-memetic prescription there's probably one where we need to be more memetic in in positive ways like love itself is memetic empathy can be memetic the paradox with all of this is like gerard would say like if you take this long enough like doesn't all memetic desire like turn negative eventually that's that's kind of the question that i and i'd love to know what the buddhist perspective on that is that's kind of the the paradox and the challenge here like we can be anti-mimetic in in 14 kind of destructive rivalry but it's kind of a constant it's not like it's something that we develop once and for all because all sort of desire can turn memetic given enough time that's my reading of gerard jonathan i don't know if you read them the same way um and it's only sort of in in finding a the right model which in the christian perspective is christ um is the only model that you can follow completely is the only model that's completely sort of worthy of following where that kind of imitation can never become rivalrous luke what do you think about the nature of inspiration here so say that i look at one of your books for example and i'm inspired and so there's something mimetic about inspiration but there's also something that is positive some that is inventive about inspiration where does that fit into this picture inspiration so you're talking about being inspired in a positive way by by somebody exactly right because i think that in the nature of being inspired is memetic because you're saying i want to be more like that and i feel called to model them but at least in its initial stages i think it's positive but i also love what you just said that given enough time all desire can turn memetic so here's the really important thing about that so if there is a if there's a positive model of desire somebody that inspires us we want to be more like that gerard says in several different places the the best models are the models that that sort of lower themselves and and don't sort of like ask to be um that that don't become what's the what's the how does he put it jonathan you might actually know where he says this i'm pretty sure it's in evolution and conversion i might have to look it up because it's really important there are certain kinds of kinds of models that inspire imitation um but then give space to the person imitating to sort of like become who they are without falling into without becoming an obstacle in a scandal to them does that make sense so like maria montessori is the example of this that i give in the book like the teacher can model a desire for something good and then withdraw as a mediator so that so that the teacher does not become a perpetual obstacle so the best models to imitate are the are the kinds of models that don't become rivals basically um and we live in a world where everybody's saying like imitate me but but like not not too much because if you get a little bit too close and you imitate me too closely whether you're a podcast host or an or whatever then that becomes dangerous there's very few people that have that kind of non-rivalrous disposition [Music] i would agree with what luke luke has said um and the first thing i'll say is that gerard is in a very unsatisfying way dead silent about most of these issues that you're asking us david uh gerard talks about conversion a little bit in this desire to see the novel uh in the piece that luke just mentioned but other than that it's mostly just doom and gloom for him even though when pressed in certain interviews he says that fundamentally uh memetic even the bad ones are this is where his ambivalence comes back in are good in some sense because it's about uh relating to the other and so maybe if we should take a step back here and try to understand what mimesis is trying to capture and what i always found helpful was the uh notion of the hume brought up in on human nature now obviously a very notion for hume that that uh almost increasing importance in his uh sort of predecessor uh adam smith is his notion of sympathy and hume had a really great metaphor that i think is just as relevant for mimesis and it's the co-vibration of violin strings if you have two strings together and you were to flick one the other would have a sort of co-vibration and that is what hume uh used as a metaphor for sympathy and i think that that is just as warranted a metaphor as mimesis it's a form of co-experience and once defined in that way you can see that mimesis and gerard does say it even if it's not prominent in his works is the basis for compassion right it's the ability to see someone to experience what they're feeling and then and then to to act as if it were your own it would be to having a wii inside the eye to use hegelian language and so clearly mimesis is such a fundamental capacity of humanity that there's no escape from it right in fact the the the arc of humanization the the transformation of ma animal to man for gerard is ma is marked by the ability of increased acquisitive mimesis right so gerard takes this as such a fundamental capacity that that that uh you know to be anti-memetic in the very naive way which which luke already sort of dismissed it almost impossible and even if it were certainly not desirable um my and this is where the buddhism part comes in but it should be accessible to everyone my stance on this is that because mimesis is is going to penetrate almost all of our uh desires and so all of our impetuses of action i think the the the real like if you want to clear cut between like good bad is between whether pride is motivating them i and i draw this distinction where uh this is only on one part of gerard he makes a distinction between quote-unquote physical desire and that's the desire for the object and experience and then metaphysical desire the desire to be and well i don't think and we discussed this bit already that all desire to be is perverse that there are many perverse manifestations of desire to be and so maybe to david to answer all of your questions simply i think insofar as you're truthful to yourself and you know that what you desire is not pride or or being or to about what the object says about you i think that's the simplest cut of what is safe and unsafe and maybe as an example even to luke's point it is unsafe to even desire someone who debases themselves if what you're doing it is out of a fundamental uh uh uh actually put this a fundamental um notion of who you self are if that 01:0:2,630 --> 01:0:3,920 01:0:2,640 --> 01:0:5,599 makes sense and and nietzsche's 01:0:3,910 --> 01:0:5,599 01:0:3,920 --> 01:0:5,920 criticism of resentment comes in here 01:0:5,589 --> 01:0:5,920 01:0:5,599 --> 01:0:8,079 01:0:5,910 --> 01:0:8,079 01:0:5,920 --> 01:0:9,040 and we can all think about the uh the 01:0:8,069 --> 01:0:9,040 01:0:8,079 --> 01:0:11,599 person who sort of 01:0:9,030 --> 01:0:11,599 01:0:9,040 --> 01:0:13,359 debases themself but clearly in a 01:0:11,589 --> 01:0:13,359 01:0:11,599 --> 01:0:16,640 passive aggressive way 01:0:13,349 --> 01:0:16,640 01:0:13,359 --> 01:0:17,760 and so i i think that if i were to make 01:0:16,630 --> 01:0:17,760 01:0:16,640 --> 01:0:20,640 one split 01:0:17,750 --> 01:0:20,640 01:0:17,760 --> 01:0:22,079 between what type of memetic desire is 01:0:20,630 --> 01:0:22,079 01:0:20,640 --> 01:0:23,119 safe or unsafe obviously there's a lot 01:0:22,069 --> 01:0:23,119 01:0:22,079 --> 01:0:25,040 more nuances 01:0:23,109 --> 01:0:25,040 01:0:23,119 --> 01:0:26,799 it would be whether that mimetic desired 01:0:25,030 --> 01:0:26,799 01:0:25,040 --> 01:0:29,440 is motivated by 01:0:26,789 --> 01:0:29,440 01:0:26,799 --> 01:0:31,119 what the object says about you or by 01:0:29,430 --> 01:0:31,119 01:0:29,440 --> 01:0:31,760 whether you really desire to have the 01:0:31,109 --> 01:0:31,760 01:0:31,119 --> 01:0:34,640 object and 01:0:31,750 --> 01:0:34,640 01:0:31,760 --> 01:0:36,240 david in your question if i'm inspired 01:0:34,630 --> 01:0:36,240 01:0:34,640 --> 01:0:37,760 to be like elon because i see all the 01:0:36,230 --> 01:0:37,760 01:0:36,240 --> 01:0:38,319 recognition that he's getting because i 01:0:37,750 --> 01:0:38,319 01:0:37,760 --> 01:0:40,480 think he's 01:0:38,309 --> 01:0:40,480 01:0:38,319 --> 01:0:42,000 you know greater than man so to speak 01:0:40,470 --> 01:0:42,000 01:0:40,480 --> 01:0:44,079 and i desire to be to be like 01:0:41,990 --> 01:0:44,079 01:0:42,000 --> 01:0:45,040 him then i think that will be perverse 01:0:44,069 --> 01:0:45,040 01:0:44,079 --> 01:0:46,720 and in fact 01:0:45,030 --> 01:0:46,720 01:0:45,040 --> 01:0:48,559 the in the moment experience of 01:0:46,710 --> 01:0:48,559 01:0:46,720 --> 01:0:50,559 entrepreneurship may be so 01:0:48,549 --> 01:0:50,559 01:0:48,559 --> 01:0:52,640 uninteresting to you that it becomes a 01:0:50,549 --> 01:0:52,640 01:0:50,559 --> 01:0:54,480 very hollowed life that you live 01:0:52,630 --> 01:0:54,480 01:0:52,640 --> 01:0:56,160 however if you're inspired by elon 01:0:54,470 --> 01:0:56,160 01:0:54,480 --> 01:0:56,880 because you love working on problems you 01:0:56,150 --> 01:0:56,880 01:0:56,160 --> 01:0:59,280 love the 01:0:56,870 --> 01:0:59,280 01:0:56,880 --> 01:1:0,559 experience of working with others and 01:0:59,270 --> 01:1:0,559 01:0:59,280 --> 01:1:2,319 and building these things and seeing 01:1:0,549 --> 01:1:2,319 01:1:0,559 --> 01:1:4,480 them through and working long hours 01:1:2,309 --> 01:1:4,480 01:1:2,319 --> 01:1:5,760 then i feel like that could be much more 01:1:4,470 --> 01:1:5,760 01:1:4,480 --> 01:1:7,680 kosher 01:1:5,750 --> 01:1:7,680 01:1:5,760 --> 01:1:9,119 yeah so pride and i would just put envy 01:1:7,670 --> 01:1:9,119 01:1:7,680 --> 01:1:11,040 right up there with pride 01:1:9,109 --> 01:1:11,040 01:1:9,119 --> 01:1:12,559 um slightly different things but gerard 01:1:11,030 --> 01:1:12,559 01:1:11,040 --> 01:1:14,079 says that envy might be like the most 01:1:12,549 --> 01:1:14,079 01:1:12,559 --> 01:1:16,000 predominant form 01:1:14,069 --> 01:1:16,000 01:1:14,079 --> 01:1:17,280 or manifestation of memetic desire in 01:1:15,990 --> 01:1:17,280 01:1:16,000 --> 01:1:17,920 the world but i would agree with you 01:1:17,270 --> 01:1:17,920 01:1:17,280 --> 01:1:21,040 like what 01:1:17,910 --> 01:1:21,040 01:1:17,920 --> 01:1:22,799 what is motivating the memetic desire um 01:1:21,030 --> 01:1:22,799 01:1:21,040 --> 01:1:24,319 one other really important point to make 01:1:22,789 --> 01:1:24,319 01:1:22,799 --> 01:1:25,280 i'm not sure how much pride comes into 01:1:24,309 --> 01:1:25,280 01:1:24,319 --> 01:1:29,599 01:1:25,270 --> 01:1:29,599 01:1:25,280 --> 01:1:31,680 but it's so mimesis memetic desire is 01:1:29,589 --> 01:1:31,680 01:1:29,599 --> 01:1:33,680 fundamental openness to other people 01:1:31,670 --> 01:1:33,680 01:1:31,680 --> 01:1:34,960 allows us to enter into their experience 01:1:33,670 --> 01:1:34,960 01:1:33,680 --> 01:1:37,680 kind of the ground 01:1:34,950 --> 01:1:37,680 01:1:34,960 --> 01:1:38,880 of empathy and sympathy like without 01:1:37,670 --> 01:1:38,880 01:1:37,680 --> 01:1:41,119 mimesis it wouldn't 01:1:38,870 --> 01:1:41,119 01:1:38,880 --> 01:1:42,640 wouldn't really be possible um the 01:1:41,109 --> 01:1:42,640 01:1:41,119 --> 01:1:44,799 important point is 01:1:42,630 --> 01:1:44,799 01:1:42,640 --> 01:1:45,920 um i mean i think one important way to 01:1:44,789 --> 01:1:45,920 01:1:44,799 --> 01:1:48,400 be anti-mimetic 01:1:45,910 --> 01:1:48,400 01:1:45,920 --> 01:1:49,920 and why we need more anti-mimetic people 01:1:48,390 --> 01:1:49,920 01:1:48,400 --> 01:1:53,200 in the best sense of the world 01:1:49,910 --> 01:1:53,200 01:1:49,920 --> 01:1:54,799 word uh is it prevents the kind of mob 01:1:53,190 --> 01:1:54,799 01:1:53,200 --> 01:1:56,400 formation 01:1:54,789 --> 01:1:56,400 01:1:54,799 --> 01:1:59,119 when people realize that they are 01:1:56,390 --> 01:1:59,119 01:1:56,400 --> 01:2:1,920 getting caught up in a memetic process 01:1:59,109 --> 01:2:1,920 01:1:59,119 --> 01:2:2,880 they lose self-possession they lose all 01:2:1,910 --> 01:2:2,880 01:2:1,920 --> 01:2:4,880 agency 01:2:2,870 --> 01:2:4,880 01:2:2,880 --> 01:2:6,079 and just seeing when that is starting to 01:2:4,870 --> 01:2:6,079 01:2:4,880 --> 01:2:8,400 happen to be able to like 01:2:6,069 --> 01:2:8,400 01:2:6,079 --> 01:2:9,359 enter into a conversation with somebody 01:2:8,390 --> 01:2:9,359 01:2:8,400 --> 01:2:11,280 that you totally 01:2:9,349 --> 01:2:11,280 01:2:9,359 --> 01:2:13,280 fundamentally disagree with on a 01:2:11,270 --> 01:2:13,280 01:2:11,280 --> 01:2:15,680 political point on a world view 01:2:13,270 --> 01:2:15,680 01:2:13,280 --> 01:2:17,200 to be able to enter into a conversation 01:2:15,670 --> 01:2:17,200 01:2:15,680 --> 01:2:17,920 with them and an experience with them 01:2:17,190 --> 01:2:17,920 01:2:17,200 --> 01:2:20,960 and say 01:2:17,910 --> 01:2:20,960 01:2:17,920 --> 01:2:22,480 listen it's oh it's okay for me to be 01:2:20,950 --> 01:2:22,480 01:2:20,960 --> 01:2:25,119 01:2:22,470 --> 01:2:25,119 01:2:22,480 --> 01:2:26,319 uh enter fully into your experience and 01:2:25,109 --> 01:2:26,319 01:2:25,119 --> 01:2:29,359 understand it 01:2:26,309 --> 01:2:29,359 01:2:26,319 --> 01:2:32,400 um without necessarily agreeing with it 01:2:29,349 --> 01:2:32,400 01:2:29,359 --> 01:2:34,799 um is a really important i think 01:2:32,390 --> 01:2:34,799 01:2:32,400 --> 01:2:36,559 thing for everybody to develop it's not 01:2:34,789 --> 01:2:36,559 01:2:34,799 --> 01:2:38,000 something we're necessarily born with 01:2:36,549 --> 01:2:38,000 01:2:36,559 --> 01:2:40,559 and it's the only way that's going to 01:2:37,990 --> 01:2:40,559 01:2:38,000 --> 01:2:41,520 prevent the herd mentality and and the 01:2:40,549 --> 01:2:41,520 01:2:40,559 --> 01:2:43,039 formation of 01:2:41,510 --> 01:2:43,039 01:2:41,520 --> 01:2:45,359 kind of mob mentality that leads to 01:2:43,029 --> 01:2:45,359 01:2:43,039 --> 01:2:46,799 scapegoats as if people develop the 01:2:45,349 --> 01:2:46,799 01:2:45,359 --> 01:2:50,000 ability to to be 01:2:46,789 --> 01:2:50,000 01:2:46,799 --> 01:2:53,039 anti-mimetic when they sense that 01:2:49,990 --> 01:2:53,039 01:2:50,000 --> 01:2:55,839 um they're sort of within the the pull 01:2:53,029 --> 01:2:55,839 01:2:53,039 --> 01:2:57,440 which is a very powerful pull of of the 01:2:55,829 --> 01:2:57,440 01:2:55,839 --> 01:2:59,599 destructive memetic desire 01:2:57,430 --> 01:2:59,599 01:2:57,440 --> 01:3:1,520 and that's that's not easy but i think 01:2:59,589 --> 01:3:1,520 01:2:59,599 --> 01:3:4,000 when you're aware of it you can at least 01:3:1,510 --> 01:3:4,000 01:3:1,520 --> 01:3:5,440 and i find myself you know sensing that 01:3:3,990 --> 01:3:5,440 01:3:4,000 --> 01:3:8,559 you can at least start to like 01:3:5,430 --> 01:3:8,559 01:3:5,440 --> 01:3:10,160 feel like a little pull and become aware 01:3:8,549 --> 01:3:10,160 01:3:8,559 --> 01:3:12,640 of it and then do what you need to do to 01:3:10,150 --> 01:3:12,640 01:3:10,160 --> 01:3:12,640 step back 01:3:14,470 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:3:14,480 --> 01:3:17,760 one of the things that as we begin to 01:3:16,789 --> 01:3:17,760 01:3:16,799 --> 01:3:19,039 wrap that i 01:3:17,750 --> 01:3:19,039 01:3:17,760 --> 01:3:21,920 feel like it's a theme in this 01:3:19,029 --> 01:3:21,920 01:3:19,039 --> 01:3:24,079 conversation for all three of us 01:3:21,910 --> 01:3:24,079 01:3:21,920 --> 01:3:25,760 gerard has exerted this positive 01:3:24,069 --> 01:3:25,760 01:3:24,079 --> 01:3:27,280 influence and i'm wondering if gerard 01:3:25,750 --> 01:3:27,280 01:3:25,760 --> 01:3:29,280 has such a positive influence at the 01:3:27,270 --> 01:3:29,280 01:3:27,280 --> 01:3:32,400 individual we can have some agency 01:3:29,270 --> 01:3:32,400 01:3:29,280 --> 01:3:34,000 but then because of the awareness of the 01:3:32,390 --> 01:3:34,000 01:3:32,400 --> 01:3:35,839 scapegoat 01:3:33,990 --> 01:3:35,839 01:3:34,000 --> 01:3:37,440 there's sort of this big picture 01:3:35,829 --> 01:3:37,440 01:3:35,839 --> 01:3:39,839 apocalyptic 01:3:37,430 --> 01:3:39,839 01:3:37,440 --> 01:3:42,000 second order effects that sort of the 01:3:39,829 --> 01:3:42,000 01:3:39,839 --> 01:3:44,000 exposure the transparency of the 01:3:41,990 --> 01:3:44,000 01:3:42,000 --> 01:3:45,280 scapegoat mechanism has created and i'm 01:3:43,990 --> 01:3:45,280 01:3:44,000 --> 01:3:47,280 wondering 01:3:45,270 --> 01:3:47,280 01:3:45,280 --> 01:3:49,200 maybe he is good for the individual bad 01:3:47,270 --> 01:3:49,200 01:3:47,280 --> 01:3:51,839 for society but jonathan you also 01:3:49,190 --> 01:3:51,839 01:3:49,200 --> 01:3:53,440 kind of shook your head when i said he's 01:3:51,829 --> 01:3:53,440 01:3:51,839 --> 01:3:54,720 that gerard has been good for us i don't 01:3:53,430 --> 01:3:54,720 01:3:53,440 --> 01:3:55,359 know if that's because he's driven you 01:3:54,710 --> 01:3:55,359 01:3:54,720 --> 01:3:59,599 insane 01:3:55,349 --> 01:3:59,599 01:3:55,359 --> 01:3:59,599 writing this book or because 01:4:3,190 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:4:3,200 --> 01:4:6,799 but no finish your question david sorry 01:4:5,589 --> 01:4:6,799 01:4:5,599 --> 01:4:9,200 well i mean that's 01:4:6,789 --> 01:4:9,200 01:4:6,799 --> 01:4:10,720 i'm really just making a conjecture here 01:4:9,190 --> 01:4:10,720 01:4:9,200 --> 01:4:12,160 01:4:10,710 --> 01:4:12,160 01:4:10,720 --> 01:4:14,160 yeah what if gerard is good for the 01:4:12,150 --> 01:4:14,160 01:4:12,160 --> 01:4:15,839 individual bad for the world 01:4:14,150 --> 01:4:15,839 01:4:14,160 --> 01:4:17,839 yeah well i i was actually going to 01:4:15,829 --> 01:4:17,839 01:4:15,839 --> 01:4:19,440 respond to luke's point i've been 01:4:17,829 --> 01:4:19,440 01:4:17,839 --> 01:4:20,799 talking so much that i would help 01:4:19,430 --> 01:4:20,799 01:4:19,440 --> 01:4:23,280 but since you asked the question i'll 01:4:20,789 --> 01:4:23,280 01:4:20,799 --> 01:4:27,039 i'll go there um 01:4:23,270 --> 01:4:27,039 01:4:23,280 --> 01:4:30,240 this sort of the positive side 01:4:27,029 --> 01:4:30,240 01:4:27,039 --> 01:4:33,359 of what luke is describing um 01:4:30,230 --> 01:4:33,359 01:4:30,240 --> 01:4:33,760 of this mob sort of mentality is a form 01:4:33,349 --> 01:4:33,760 01:4:33,359 --> 01:4:35,440 01:4:33,750 --> 01:4:35,440 01:4:33,760 --> 01:4:38,079 union with a larger whole right it's 01:4:35,430 --> 01:4:38,079 01:4:35,440 --> 01:4:40,480 kind of this sort of like solidarity 01:4:38,069 --> 01:4:40,480 01:4:38,079 --> 01:4:41,680 and this and in fact in violence and the 01:4:40,470 --> 01:4:41,680 01:4:40,480 --> 01:4:43,039 sacred obviously there's gonna be 01:4:41,670 --> 01:4:43,039 01:4:41,680 --> 01:4:44,799 negative connotations because it has to 01:4:43,029 --> 01:4:44,799 01:4:43,039 --> 01:4:46,880 do with pagan religions 01:4:44,789 --> 01:4:46,880 01:4:44,799 --> 01:4:48,240 gerard basically said and i'm just 01:4:46,870 --> 01:4:48,240 01:4:46,880 --> 01:4:51,039 paraphrasing here 01:4:48,230 --> 01:4:51,039 01:4:48,240 --> 01:4:52,640 that mythology or the sacred is nothing 01:4:51,029 --> 01:4:52,640 01:4:51,039 --> 01:4:55,200 but unanimity 01:4:52,630 --> 01:4:55,200 01:4:52,640 --> 01:4:55,760 and this is why uh this sort of lack of 01:4:55,190 --> 01:4:55,760 01:4:55,200 --> 01:4:57,599 reason 01:4:55,750 --> 01:4:57,599 01:4:55,760 --> 01:5:0,160 and the proliferation of the mob is 01:4:57,589 --> 01:5:0,160 01:4:57,599 --> 01:5:3,680 important for the sacrificial mechanism 01:5:0,150 --> 01:5:3,680 01:5:0,160 --> 01:5:5,200 it's the what enables everyone 01:5:3,670 --> 01:5:5,200 01:5:3,680 --> 01:5:6,400 yeah and i think that's a good question 01:5:5,190 --> 01:5:6,400 01:5:5,200 --> 01:5:7,359 also to go back into earlier 01:5:6,390 --> 01:5:7,359 01:5:6,400 --> 01:5:10,079 conversation 01:5:7,349 --> 01:5:10,079 01:5:7,359 --> 01:5:11,039 what enables everyone in thieves to 01:5:10,069 --> 01:5:11,039 01:5:10,079 --> 01:5:14,240 believe that 01:5:11,029 --> 01:5:14,240 01:5:11,039 --> 01:5:15,440 this one patricidal ancestral guy caused 01:5:14,230 --> 01:5:15,440 01:5:14,240 --> 01:5:18,240 the entire plague 01:5:15,430 --> 01:5:18,240 01:5:15,440 --> 01:5:20,160 what it what is it it's not reason it's 01:5:18,230 --> 01:5:20,160 01:5:18,240 --> 01:5:21,599 unanimity it's simply because everyone 01:5:20,150 --> 01:5:21,599 01:5:20,160 --> 01:5:22,720 else in thieves believes that it 01:5:21,589 --> 01:5:22,720 01:5:21,599 --> 01:5:25,039 happened 01:5:22,710 --> 01:5:25,039 01:5:22,720 --> 01:5:26,720 and so again that might be a negative 01:5:25,029 --> 01:5:26,720 01:5:25,039 --> 01:5:29,039 example maybe a positive example would 01:5:26,710 --> 01:5:29,039 01:5:26,720 --> 01:5:31,839 be cheering on for a sports team 01:5:29,029 --> 01:5:31,839 01:5:29,039 --> 01:5:33,520 but even in in what we just described 01:5:31,829 --> 01:5:33,520 01:5:31,839 --> 01:5:35,039 and clear there are instances where luke 01:5:33,510 --> 01:5:35,039 01:5:33,520 --> 01:5:36,319 is right that it'd be good to stand up 01:5:35,029 --> 01:5:36,319 01:5:35,039 --> 01:5:40,000 against the mob 01:5:36,309 --> 01:5:40,000 01:5:36,319 --> 01:5:41,760 but there is a form of 01:5:39,990 --> 01:5:41,760 01:5:40,000 --> 01:5:43,039 morphing with a larger group with the 01:5:41,750 --> 01:5:43,039 01:5:41,760 --> 01:5:45,839 mob that is 01:5:43,029 --> 01:5:45,839 01:5:43,039 --> 01:5:47,920 at the very least a very enjoyable human 01:5:45,829 --> 01:5:47,920 01:5:45,839 --> 01:5:49,440 experience to be a part of 01:5:47,910 --> 01:5:49,440 01:5:47,920 --> 01:5:51,440 and again this is where gerard's 01:5:49,430 --> 01:5:51,440 01:5:49,440 --> 01:5:52,640 ambivalence comes from and i i don't 01:5:51,430 --> 01:5:52,640 01:5:51,440 --> 01:5:55,599 think we can make any 01:5:52,630 --> 01:5:55,599 01:5:52,640 --> 01:5:57,280 sweeping conjectures um i think if 01:5:55,589 --> 01:5:57,280 01:5:55,599 --> 01:5:59,440 you're given a specific environment 01:5:57,270 --> 01:5:59,440 01:5:57,280 --> 01:6:1,520 maybe like the nazis or the french 01:5:59,430 --> 01:6:1,520 01:5:59,440 --> 01:6:4,079 resistance or in a sports team 01:6:1,510 --> 01:6:4,079 01:6:1,520 --> 01:6:5,039 we have more to say about what one ought 01:6:4,069 --> 01:6:5,039 01:6:4,079 --> 01:6:7,680 to do 01:6:5,029 --> 01:6:7,680 01:6:5,039 --> 01:6:9,359 but even then if you read too much 01:6:7,670 --> 01:6:9,359 01:6:7,680 --> 01:6:11,520 you're gonna 01:6:9,349 --> 01:6:11,520 01:6:9,359 --> 01:6:13,520 yeah so speak we're i'm obviously using 01:6:11,510 --> 01:6:13,520 01:6:11,520 --> 01:6:14,880 mob in the negative sense um 01:6:13,510 --> 01:6:14,880 01:6:13,520 --> 01:6:16,720 as you're saying that i'm reminded of 01:6:14,870 --> 01:6:16,720 01:6:14,880 --> 01:6:18,400 tony shea in his book delivering 01:6:16,710 --> 01:6:18,400 01:6:16,720 --> 01:6:20,400 happiness right where he 01:6:18,390 --> 01:6:20,400 01:6:18,400 --> 01:6:21,440 he looked at raves as this like 01:6:20,390 --> 01:6:21,440 01:6:20,400 --> 01:6:23,280 beautiful 01:6:21,430 --> 01:6:23,280 01:6:21,440 --> 01:6:24,480 union with other people and it is like 01:6:23,270 --> 01:6:24,480 01:6:23,280 --> 01:6:27,359 we we seek that 01:6:24,470 --> 01:6:27,359 01:6:24,480 --> 01:6:29,200 right it's a form of transcendence that 01:6:27,349 --> 01:6:29,200 01:6:27,359 --> 01:6:32,000 every human being seeks and he 01:6:29,190 --> 01:6:32,000 01:6:29,200 --> 01:6:32,559 found a transcendent experience in a 01:6:31,990 --> 01:6:32,559 01:6:32,000 --> 01:6:34,400 rave 01:6:32,549 --> 01:6:34,400 01:6:32,559 --> 01:6:35,680 there's something like we do want to be 01:6:34,390 --> 01:6:35,680 01:6:34,400 --> 01:6:38,000 in union with other people it's 01:6:35,670 --> 01:6:38,000 01:6:35,680 --> 01:6:40,319 something that every person craves 01:6:37,990 --> 01:6:40,319 01:6:38,000 --> 01:6:42,480 gerard used a very interesting term to 01:6:40,309 --> 01:6:42,480 01:6:40,319 --> 01:6:45,520 sort of describe the scapegoat mechanism 01:6:42,470 --> 01:6:45,520 01:6:42,480 --> 01:6:49,039 and he says it's deviated transcendence 01:6:45,510 --> 01:6:49,039 01:6:45,520 --> 01:6:51,280 so so when sometimes people find 01:6:49,029 --> 01:6:51,280 01:6:49,039 --> 01:6:52,880 transcendence in the wrong ways like 01:6:51,270 --> 01:6:52,880 01:6:51,280 --> 01:6:54,640 it's kind of like right desire 01:6:52,870 --> 01:6:54,640 01:6:52,880 --> 01:6:56,160 right transcendence like we all sort of 01:6:54,630 --> 01:6:56,160 01:6:54,640 --> 01:6:59,440 seek that um 01:6:56,150 --> 01:6:59,440 01:6:56,160 --> 01:7:1,440 but when it's found in the mob he calls 01:6:59,430 --> 01:7:1,440 01:6:59,440 --> 01:7:3,359 that deviated transcendence and that 01:7:1,430 --> 01:7:3,359 01:7:1,440 --> 01:7:6,400 every scapegoat mechanism 01:7:3,349 --> 01:7:6,400 01:7:3,359 --> 01:7:8,480 is are our humans like finding uh a 01:7:6,390 --> 01:7:8,480 01:7:6,400 --> 01:7:10,000 negative form of transcendence and and 01:7:8,470 --> 01:7:10,000 01:7:8,480 --> 01:7:12,400 and unifies them 01:7:9,990 --> 01:7:12,400 01:7:10,000 --> 01:7:14,559 so there is to your point there's this 01:7:12,390 --> 01:7:14,559 01:7:12,400 --> 01:7:18,480 deep ambivalence about it right 01:7:14,549 --> 01:7:18,480 01:7:14,559 --> 01:7:21,599 um so it's not that it's bad in itself 01:7:18,470 --> 01:7:21,599 01:7:18,480 --> 01:7:24,640 it's that the way that we often find it 01:7:21,589 --> 01:7:24,640 01:7:21,599 --> 01:7:26,160 uh can can result in in negative 01:7:24,630 --> 01:7:26,160 01:7:24,640 --> 01:7:26,799 consequences and violence to other 01:7:26,150 --> 01:7:26,799 01:7:26,160 --> 01:7:28,640 01:7:26,789 --> 01:7:28,640 01:7:26,799 --> 01:7:29,920 so that that term kept coming back to me 01:7:28,630 --> 01:7:29,920 01:7:28,640 --> 01:7:31,280 and this goes all the way back to the 01:7:29,910 --> 01:7:31,280 01:7:29,920 --> 01:7:33,359 beginning of our conversation 01:7:31,270 --> 01:7:33,359 01:7:31,280 --> 01:7:34,400 we were talking about you know uh 01:7:33,349 --> 01:7:34,400 01:7:33,359 --> 01:7:36,960 equality and 01:7:34,390 --> 01:7:36,960 01:7:34,400 --> 01:7:38,400 and sameness and differentiation so 01:7:36,950 --> 01:7:38,400 01:7:36,960 --> 01:7:40,559 we're kind of we're almost coming full 01:7:38,390 --> 01:7:40,559 01:7:38,400 --> 01:7:42,400 circle when we when we talk about mobs 01:7:40,549 --> 01:7:42,400 01:7:40,559 --> 01:7:45,520 and the need for for union with other 01:7:42,390 --> 01:7:45,520 01:7:42,400 --> 01:7:46,960 people it's a double-edged sword 01:7:45,510 --> 01:7:46,960 01:7:45,520 --> 01:7:48,480 that's a great place to close good 01:7:46,950 --> 01:7:48,480 01:7:46,960 --> 01:7:48,960 conversation gentlemen thank you very 01:7:48,470 --> 01:7:48,960 01:7:48,480 --> 01:7:53,599 much 01:7:48,950 --> 01:7:53,599 01:7:48,960 --> 01:7:53,599 thank you thanks so much guys
