Patrick McKenzie works at stripe I called him the Michael Jordan of online writing yesterday with no joke there whatsoever Patrick is my friend Ryan Delk called him the og a couple weeks ago and I think that that's absolutely true he works at stripe but he's known as patio 11 and we are going to be talking about all kinds of basically the intersection of building online businesses software companies and writing online but Patrick I think the first place that I wanted to start with you is you're really into this kooky idea of using world of warcraft for job interviews why don't you talk about that okay so I did not say that I would use world Warcraft for job interviews but I think that it um it does actually have interesting training for being leaders the way way back in the day I started writing for the internet and quite a bit in 2006 and it was partly because I needed a new hobby because from 2004 through 2006 theoretically speaking I had a job but my actual job was running the world Warcraft trade guild and funny enough that is the only leadership experience and my resume when I became CEO of a later startup and I literally very literally had on my resume for it I ran a rape guild that had eight direct reports and we did budget in meetings etc etc um I think that just like the internet gives people opportunities to write in ways that you don't need permission to write on the internet and just like the open source community allows you to participate in software products without needing to be selected by gatekeepers at a software company as being like legit enough to practice software professionally that this is gonna sound crazy but hear me out World of Warcraft lets you run a multinational organization with 40-plus people in it and without needing to be selected by an MBA or etc etc that would traditionally gate keep opportunities to run a an organization to do things like job interviews and hard discussions about how a person is not maybe meeting their quarterly goals if you don't believe that world work afters quarterly goals you'd haven't played World of Warcraft right and things like you know mediating conflicts between employees dealing with budgets dealing with like a very literal thing we had was a you know compensation strategy that both with eyes on like making people feel that their contributions to you know killing dragons were adequately rewarded and with regards to like you know market norms on our server and making sure that like will equip tanks didn't go over to competing clams because guilds rather because that would you know decrease our ability to productively kill dragons man I can't want to geek out more about World of Warcraft but it's been many years and I don't remember all that many specifics I just want to say like this is one of those like crazy ideas which is less crazy if you think about it more and I've thought about this particular one quite a lot well I think that this is an interesting place for us to go down and that I think that one of the interesting things about writing online both from a company perspective of companies looking at talent and also for you as somebody who maybe wants to get a job who wants to meet people is writing online takes you from somebody who's illegible to somebody who is legible and I think that what you're saying with World of Warcraft is there are places in the world where there's legibility and there are signals being given to us that we are ignoring and on both the company side the entrepreneur side and on the producer side people aren't taking advantage of this and this is low-hanging fruit I think I agree with that I also think that then there's sort of an is off distinction as like world Warcraft to the extent that is the signal is not treated as a very sorry world Warcraft to the extent that it provides legibility and to say management talent or realized ability to do well there it's not treated to signal by high status employers and whereas writing on the other hand is a nice arbitrage opportunity because writing is treated as signal fold by high status employers and so you know to the extent that you were like choosing which will I do for career advancement and kill onyxia more and it's is nowhere near the entertainment world Warcraft anymore you get the idea like kill more dragons or write more essays I would probably suggest write more essays for most people and that is sort of a thing that we come back to again and again and again in our discussions that I think that people probably spend a little too little time thinking about em you know there is great value in writing just for the love of it writing and whatever form factor works for your writing and whatever strikes your interests and yet when you are doing it for career purposes you sort of have to think of like what is the market going to look at in such a way that it will raise their estimation of my abilities to do commercial work and there are certain form factors like say fanfic which don't like cause the market to re-evaluate upwards your ability to to do meaningful work and it would for some people but they're few and far between and I think that's unfortunate and a way for those people to like get advantaged from the market that they wouldn't otherwise get and but it also matters for and we've talked about this before like if you are quote unquote a blogger and like blogging has a poor brand with in many high status employers where it's like you know writing memos does not they teach you how to write memos in MBA school they actually don't for people somehow thinks they do and so if you're if your output was characterized more as an essay or a memo or a guide or a market analysis etc etc that would be pound-for-pound more impactful for you than categorize again this blog post so one thing that I advocate that people do is to and I think of the way that their output is going to be perceived as by the user and make relatively small changes to package it in such a way that it will be perceived as high value by default and that might be things like you know you can use whatever blogging software you want but don't call it a blog and guilty for 10 plus years here don't put a date on it if it's not content that's going to decay to do a irrelevance within 48 hours after posting it and since you have a choice of what to write about largely choose not to write about things that will decay to a realm within 48 hours instead choose choose to write about things that will still be relevant 10 years from now etc etc etc so this is a question from Matt what did you expect when starting to write online that ended up surprising you something that you didn't expect where your assumptions ended up being different once you started to actually go through the craft sure so yes that's a question both about surprise and about expectations management's back in 2006 I didn't really have high expectations for writing online I had so set the stage I had just arrived in Japan actually Natura had been there for two and a half years at that point and I have been described as a good writer for a while at this point to a bye-bye teachers but you know being out of college there was no longer any impetus to to write large volumes into write well I thought well writing is a useful skill and like all skills it decays over time if you don't use it and my day job in Japan is not causing me to write a lot of English so mmm I rather enjoy writing it would be unfortunate if my ability here decayed to nothing so one of the reasons that I wrote was just sort of like the bicycle for the mind / stationary bike for the craft of writing just I will probably use this in the future I don't want to decay at it I'm a surprising thing is that go figure when you spend a lot of time doing something for a while you don't tend to plateau at that thing you tend to get better over time particularly if you keep pushing yourself some different directions and another thing that surprised me relative to expectations is that the not all writing from an effort perspective is created equal with regards to achieving those goals or for any other for that matter any other goals I a selection of topics for the first several years of writing on that and was basically I'm just going to blog there's that word again I'm just gonna blog about whatever is on top of my mind today and so in a day where I did a lot of counting I would read about accounting a day where I did a lot of you know optimization of the performance of my job of swinging up I regret about the performance of a job swinging at cetera et cetera and it was very sort of scattershot there was no rhyme or reason other than that well if you if you enjoy my story then here's the next update on it but if if you weren't like bought into the patio 11 story then there was no particular reason that come to my blog on any given day and well aside from maybe like to enjoy just the consumption of things that I've write in my voices etc and it turned out after a couple years when I was looking at back at both of my stats and what people were telling me I'm like this is clearly your best work is that FA external to the craft of writing about it I have a comparative advantage on the intersection and the Venn diagram between marketing and engineering a much better engineer than virtually all marketers and I'm a much better marketer than virtually all engineers and I wrote about that intersection very well and the more I wrote about things in that intersection the better it did and be better I wrote them sort of like long movie detail heavy posts in that intersection the better they did versus like that 200 word well I'm trying to keep up my streak so I might as well write something today to say that it wrote something on Thursday and so after I started operationalizing that and saying okay I don't have a boss per se for my blog I can still write about anything I want to write about but when I'm thinking of things to write about I should probably be company stuff that's and gonna quote my beats or adjacent to it and and I should probably be writing form factors that work for me which tend to be like 8,000 word effort posts and the people start liking the output more I started getting better at that variety of output there was a compounding goodness to it I had it more of a quote unquote brand developing for myself that is not scare quotes and that there was a virtuous cycle there of like a tighter brand for my work cost more people to like it caused them to come back more often and to recommend it to people caused them to like if it if things that Jason's that brand were disgust time and people would inject me into the conversation even without me being in that room etc etc which gave me more opportunities to write which gave me more virtuous circle all the way around so they don't specifically regret spending a couple of years just in that experimental phase of throwing stuff to the wall on the internet and seeing what sticks but if I got a do-over would probably have been actively looking for okay you know what is working what do I enjoy writing what fills in a need for contemporary we phrased it what fills the hole in the internet and there are holes in the internet but there are some that are more valuable than others at the it is extremely useful that the thing that happened to be my intersection of the Venn diagram happens to be extremely commercializable for wealthy old companies software companies and particularly aren't going to run out of money to throw out the questionnaires like engineering + marketing software anytime soon and so if I got a do-over I would be looking at like what are the opportunities that you know hit both my interests my ability to write something well and that expressed no needs of relatively well-heeled participants of the economy yep so how like in network building there's the famous chicken and egg problem like if there's a demand driven marketplace how do you actually get those first customers there and there's a similar question within writing of when you were doing your bingo card maker how did you get people to discover your blog at the beginning or maybe you can tell a story from stripe I know in the early days of stripe there was writing as part of the history how should we solve the chicken and egg problem of online writing so one meta comment before we get in into solving the chicken egg problem I think too many people are paralyzed and the ability to write or the desire to write by saying like it doesn't matter if I write if I don't have an audience to be able to shift those words - and I think that even if you have literally zero people who read what you write today it is still worth writing that thing today because you will produce an asset that you can use in the future in one-on-one conversations and this is 180 degrees from how most people think about audience building or writing online and playing for the numbers but if the only thing you got out of writing an essay about whatever the topic is for you is that the next time you're doing a job search when you are writing cold emails to hiring managers for whatever the position is that you're going after you can use that one essay that you wrote back in the as a proof-of-work and like hey I have clearly thought about this more than most people who are sending you a cold email with a link to a resume that you're gonna like skim for 30 seconds and that would already be like the highest ROI on writing a piece that most writers will get so I would not feel like don't feel like you need to solve the chicken-and-egg problem prior to prior to writing that said the chicken-and-egg like cold start problem is a real problem and the and your audience exists somewhere and it is likely a combination of bowls like you know if you're solving this need that doesn't yet exist on the Internet's it's probably a collection of people who don't yet know that they should be friends but also some folks that are already friends or already an audience elsewhere and so if you find those places where your crowd or the people who should be in your crowd naturally congregates sort of participating in those spaces and then gradually injecting your stuff into those spaces works rather well too few people remember it but there was back in the day the sad forum called the business of software that was hosted by Joel Spolsky and there were yours truly and maybe two dozen other people there that were building software companies all at the same time and then if you you know use the magic massive participation on the internet that implies there were a couple hundred people reading it and and a lot of those two dozen people went on to do great things and of the note 60 people that read my blog on the first day that it existed back in 2006 I assume virtually all of them saw it because they had seen the you know participating on that forum for six plus months and so saw it when I posted I started a blog today and I'm going to launch a piece of software in a week I here's my post about it am the explosion of social media the last couple years makes this easier because you can sort of like interact with people who have large audiences on social media and then and this is the tricky benefit gradually and in an authentic way introduce your pieces into replies about their pieces or your thoughts into replies about their thoughts and and there is some deep deep social technology and nuance about doing that in a way that is both true to your values and that annoying for the person that you are sort of climbing onto and also not annoying for their audience but I've seen many many people sort of do that and do that relatively well and there is also by the way it like people who you know affirmative Lee makes space for that sort of thing and I I feel a little weird pointing at particular examples but there are well I'll point it myself I have a sorry one moment well I made phone and if a standing invitation on my website that please send me email I like getting email at like reading things people have written etcetera etc and there are other people who have like standing policies with signal boosting people who are new to the industry etc etc if you had DM them on Twitter and so if you wrote something that was relevant to an industry and you knew that folks like that existed that might be a DM we're sending out Twitter or similarly anyone with podcast is typically looking for an interview based podcast they're looking for more folks to interview at there are both social reasons for them to want to vary the like career stage except for etc of the folks the interview subset that they will be willing to interview at least some relative unknowns and there's also in addition to social reasons like that helps them with that both and availability concerns the yeah it is a true fact that you know the same 100 people and whatever your neck of the woods is I'd get quote unquote all the requests and given that they have limited amounts of time there you can help people with filling holes in their schedule by saying hey I actually have an interesting take on this here's the proof of works that ever in that that shows you about this would you like to have me on your podcast when it comes to when it comes to this like I feel like you're hitting at something here between owned platforms and then like borrowed platforms so you spend a lot of time on Hacker News you are talking about the Joel Sapolsky platform earlier so how do you think of see like there's two ways to sort of give this brash advice for writers and I actually think that they're both wrong the first is go publish on sort of the BuzzFeed bottle we're just gonna be everywhere and we're not gonna be collecting a lot of emails and then we're just gonna depend on these platforms for our own livelihood that's the first model and I don't think that's right the second model is only right online but then you struggle to get distribution or only right on your own website but then you struggle to get distribution so how do you actually go on a hacker news how to actually go on a Joel Sapolsky and then transfer that social capital into your own walled garden so interestingly I think that people should probably have a slightly more detailed model of how their business works then it all being in a walled garden and we can talk about that in substantial amounts of detail but as I say that you probably want to have something available which is a friend catcher that is accessible by anyone and then in email gate and which doesn't require payment and then probably some paid products perhaps out of the scope of this discussion and the dude consulting for a while and consultants have this nice sort of mental model and what is the level of depth do you go to in a coffee chat versus what is the level of depth so you go to and deliverable and making sure that like you know coffee chats are free use that as a it's a cost of doing business for you just to get into conversations that could turn into a potential engagements deliverables on the other hand are very not free and they're the scope adem is committed to in advance and they have some features and then the price is the price when I'm writing on Hacker News any time a field of a comment is becoming and less of like an ad hoc just meet participating in water cooler discussion or more of like no way I actually have something that there was a core value here and people would probably be referring to this for years if it had a permanent home I make sure that the permanent home for that thing is my blog I'm actually my best blog well best according to the pageviews metric and blog post ever was originally hacker news Gottman it was John Graham Cummings wrote a blog post about his frustrations of being told his name was and and I there was a threat on Hacker News about this and I wrote a I started writing comment if all the different ways that sufferer got names wrong and after I had 25 of them like this really should not be a hacker news gamut and so soft dough braided the blog and posted falsehoods programmers belief about name names this is back in 2010 and it still gets name checked on Twitter at 10 plus times a week it has more citations in academic work then I feel is reasonably justified and it's sort of like the canonical place people point to when someone again gets this frustration about you know software has rejected my name and now I feel a little annoyed slash that which happens to me on a weekly basis because I have the last name McKenzie and I live in Japan definitely drove a bit of my heat when I was you know pounding out this ihn comet and so when I do things like you know tweet storms etc etc when I feel like okay my level of engagement in the street storm is getting over like 15 minute mark and there seems to be some I don't know I won't say there's no actual thought that goes into tweet storms and I'm like developing themes here and Inter laying them against other pieces and maybe like sighting out to to other work that it's been I've been done on this I start thinking maybe I should like promote this into a blog post and typically that I don't just like copies tweets torment to blog post and call it a day rather I use that tweet storm or the Asian comment or that sort of thing that you like you know think out loud if it were I do my best thinking my writing and then go back into the cave write up a real version and then post that tyler tringa had a good question about the benefits of long-form writing you said earlier that your sweet spot was right around 8,000 words and it does seem that you do prefer those long-form essays so when it comes to being online and and and you said this to me a couple weeks ago there are people who quite literally run the world people who are this your CEOs of Fortune 500 companies executives and they'll wake up in the morning they'll read ten thousand word essay and - right off to work so Patrick I thought that the internet was optimized for short posts attention spans are falling yada yada yada all these traditional narratives what are people missing a lot of people missing um incentive structures rule everything around me so the we could have a long long discussion about this but so much about that the received wisdom of the art of doing the internet well is downstream of the incentive structures of large b2c advertising platforms and like large producers of inventory for b2c advertising platforms and you know not to pick on BuzzFeed but since BuzzFeed is widely acknowledged to be extremely good at exploiting this dynamic and like BuzzFeed has done a lot of research and what the cost curve for production of the listicle is versus the number of eyeballs that they'll get if it has a attractive title on it versus what the the cost curve is for producing long-form reporting and how many people will stay on that long-form reporting and long enough to count as an impression for their advertisers and the there are Oh a trade-off for BuzzFeed is pretty clear they want to have almost all of their work in and easy to consume easy to share preferably easy to share without even having to read it kind of bucket and yet like most people in the world are not selling remnant inventory via and ad publisher and if your goals are not selling a remnant inventory an ad publisher don't take advice from people whose writing habits have been optimized for that incentive structure and and so like what is my incentive structure from writing is an interesting and deep question like you could probably draw up you know 100 people out of my professional network and say you know there there was like some curve of how much you know how much they like me or believe that I'm sagacious or I believe that I'm capable of doing material work and how recently has that impression been reinforced and then you know what is the lifetime value of that relationship to me and so I'm fairly certain that if I drew out that curve and then drew it out to there's like some notion of core audience for me I think I have some somewhere on the order of like 80,000 followers on Twitter and I bet of those 15 to 20,000 or more core audience so maybe like extending out to like 15 km extended out to at 80 km and maybe extend it out to some number of people who have like oh I know that Petiot 11 guy from rumors from around the internet but it wouldn't exactly call myself a family yeah I'm pretty sure that the most of the weight in that curve is in the top hundred and so that if I'm being rigorous an optimal around it and the right form factor is whatever I can produce in a and in such a fashion that the top hundred like get more weight in the group and and possibly you know possibly like how do I do that while also you know continuing to expand the number of people who are in those like closer closer circles of the orbit and increasing that aggregate value in those closer circles and but like I'm not competing with BuzzFeed not competing with the New York Times and I'm not even competing with most people who now are engineers and writes like if you write about docker bully for you the the like the person you were writing for and sort of the the time that they would allocate to read the things that you were writing don't come out of the same it's not the same person it's not same bucket that my writing comes out and so you know we are we're disjoint in the same way that a game of Thrones and I are disjoint and and that's not a value judgment by the way and it's not even a value judgment on BuzzFeed although I have some value chefs from inside BuzzFeed that I could share but neither here nor there I it you know you just have to understand who the audience is what your goals are what the incentive structure is for meeting those goals well let's just go there how would you think about actually making those illegible structures legible so that you have something that you're at least oriented towards um I think that Google Analytics is the best where software that ever existed because of exactly that reason and the what's the old saw that as soon as the measure becomes the target it yada-yada-yada and somebody's lost the good hearts law good hearts law thank you as soon as people put things on a dashboard it starts to recompile their decision-making process around it and so you have to be very careful about what you put em in dashboard in Google puts and time on site on the dashboard because it's extremely easy for them to well it is actually extremely easy for them to measure but it's measurable hits are measurable and whereas you know both for like privacy reasons and because that there just isn't good data and who something affected how deeply it affected them and whether it affected them in a positive fashion whether caused them to change a decision they were going to make and did that decision like did it swing a big door in their life not Google Analytics won't give you any of these things but these are far closer to the sorts of impact that I think most people want to have and the illegible 'ti of games mmm it comes in all over the place and I think it is one reason why people sort of systemically under undervalue writing as a discipline and one of the things people say when they are setting and you know blogging is so over there used to be all these great blogs and then nobody blogs anymore what happened to that is they're not realizing how effective blogging was for the people that were doing it and and a lot of people who were you know bloggers back in the day and like they didn't have a heart attack and keel over their key keyboard while writing a blog post there they're still around and kicking it and their careers have done things in the last couple years and often their careers have done things such that they are no longer considered like bloggers and and so you know if I ask somebody like okay if you think blog instead and was not dead in 2010 who are your five top bloggers of 2010 and usually they have an answer to that question then like great what's their job title right now like CEO and to rich to have for work again CEO senior staff engineer at Google and etc like you know the reason why they're not describing themselves a blogger anymore because it's a massive downgrade over the thing that blogging got them to and and the like similarly when people are thinking of incentive structures I think folks would probably be a lot of folks would be surprised on the like raw numbers of how many people read nice stuff like I'm you know I do not run a media property is sort of sort of numbers a I think first-run si from myself would probably get somewhere on the order of like 50,000 readers or so and then my granted the best stuff from the archives sees a couple hundred thousand readers every year for essentially forever as far as I can determine I've post from 2012 about sale during negotiation that did five hundred thousand readers last year and so you know presumably will be seen by many many millions and years to come on the school decides to take a whack at me at the you know those numbers mmm they did a they don't adequately describe like the degree to which my habit of writing helped accelerate my for software businesses that a run they don't adequately describe how it helped you know expose me to people that will both help with the stripe stage my career in future stages my career and and they I think they also don't describe like internal changes that made you know it might seem a little weird like you wouldn't say it's weird for someone to have an internal change as a result of going to a gym I think there are some people who would think that it it is weird to say that you have an internal change as a result of like doing push-ups before your brain but I think that is probably descriptively accurate so you know it is probably better for me on that that I spent 10,000 plus hours writing versus spending 10,000 plus hours playing World of Warcraft or watching TV or something yeah so would you talk about 10,000 plus hours writing what is your writing process look like because from what I've read about you you are the kind of person who sits down on a Saturday morning and the entire idea has crystallized and you just bang out an essay and you don't leave your chair until that essay is basically done which is the exact opposite of how I do it and I know Tyler Cowen is also like a write everyday guy you don't seem as much like a write everyday guy so what is your process for stringing together ideas and then I know that people are thinking this but like do you have a motivation issue or like how do you keep yourself disciplined or are those even questions that you're thinking about so I'm all over the map on this and as someone who's talked to a number of great writers and to throw some names they haven't come up yet but should Matt Lavine he writes a column every day called money stuff which is delivered over email and is sort of my North Star for when I grow up I want to be able to write more like Matt beam em at burnt Albert's etc had the everybody has their own process mine is substantially like you described with with I'll say one thing which is that prior to the Saturday where I have spent six hours shackled and chair writing like a man possessed I typically I'm chewing over an idea for on the low end a couple of days on the higher end a couple of weeks and it's yeah a bit of an obsessive and so it's a lot of like shower thoughts which go everything from like you know what are the angles that I could take any particular piece all the way to and what are some anecdotes that I could bring in maybe even like particularly good turns to the phrase yeah and then they don't sit down for writing like a man possessed until I'm pretty much decided on the angle and I have the rough structure if it in my head and then please don't feel like you need to duplicate this anybody because I know a lot of great writers don't do this but um I start at the top I run until I get to the bottom I do one reread for structure to say like you know and a paragraph by paragraph level is this narrative like structure in the right fashion or would it would it look better if I like move this third of the essay up a little bit and then do one more read on you know attempting to get less red marks from my sophomore English teacher and and then push go and that's when I can control via the writing style and the timeline for the piece you know I occasionally have been known to write for other people or write in a professional capacity and then sometimes there's other constraints like sign-off from various other stakeholders you know a deadline which is a terrifying word for me and we have a business event happening and Tuesday the 27th and then there is a you know production workflow which happens and so we will need you know the words lacked by whatever it is the fifteenth and so you know your words need to be ready by the 15th that's the thing that happens I attempt to make do with that yeah you asked about motivation they given that I am an obsession driven writer you know cultivating more intellectual obsessions costs me to write more and so to the extent that I want to write more which I certainly want to write more the thing that gets me inspired to do that is I they're having more conversations with people and much like this conversation or reading more interesting things and so more more and more varied input leads to more and more varied output at least with respect to yours truly yeah you once said that ramit sethi is like for you one of your all-time favorite marketers and one of the very best people at using the internet and what the two of you have in common is you have a big regret of not using email sooner what is it that people miss about email why is it important and how should people think about growing their lists so I will say that do what I say not what I do I don't have an active lead medalist at the moment which is a straight-up missed opportunity there's reasons for that I'm quite busy between my day job and having had two small children etc etc and when I was evaluating life back in 2016 well one thing has to get dropped probably shouldn't be either of those two things are sleep so maybe I should write a little less than I have previously outside a day job but do what I say but not what I do the why email so many thoughts here one emails something that you can own and that is very difficult to take away from you in a way that your presence on social media platforms cetera is not the people who have not just opted in opted in this so for for used in email marketing circles like folks is like really just stuck up their their hand and said yes I want exactly what it is that that you do and I would like to get that in my life on a daily or weekly or whatever basis and those folks are a less likely to burn out on your stuff than folks in you know have an interesting relationship with hacker news at D there is a better than 50/50 shot that anything that I write will hit the top of hacker news which is an interesting cheat code for a writer to have and and yet like partly as a participant in that community who doesn't want to see that community gets stressed over a thing and partly as someone who hates seeing negative stuff written about him on the internet and I'm sort of rate limited in how much I can write because at you know most people in hacker news did not come to Accra News specifically to see my stuff and so if my stuff was sitting in the top factor news unlike a weekly basis or a daily basis that would be too much whereas I feel far less or doesn't sound like if I told you hey sign up for this for this you know daily newsletter and I will give you a daily newsletter there's probably not a great framing but whatever it's easy to understand and like nobody who signs up for a daily newsletter from patio 11 is going to be annoyed when on Wednesday and back in their their inbox covering my usual beat like you know it did exactly what it says on the tin and so being able to control the the framing of what it is you offer the cadence the sort of like brand positioning of it and is much higher with regards to email than it is in participation in forums and communities on social media etcetera and you also have more control over both who gets your thing and in what way they get it theoretically speaking your email can get forwarded to anybody and that is a good thing for many people who write email because they know forwarding to your friends is one way to grow your list but there isn't really a culture of like forward and newsletter to a business associate to dunk on the newsletter in a way that there is definitely culture and Twitter of like retweet with comment to dunk to a much larger audience and so that changes the risk calculus both like the psychic risk calculus of death you know extremely real like career-oriented risk calculus of like participating and so you can I think participate a little more authentically with respect to writing email to close to audience of people who have largely they largely know you and like what you're selling quote unquote versus writing and Twitter and you kind of also always have to hit have in the back of your head you know a process run again is this going to excite one of the many opposed Internet outrage machines that are active on Twitter and it cost me to have a really bad day and that's very definitely something like I have to think about when when writing and Twitter's and it wouldn't have to think about when writing to my usual audience and I know some great authors who write less then they would and write them in a less less impactful or pointed or true mannered and they would specifically because they're worried about you know social media pylons which seems like on the one hand incentives rule everything around me I understand the thought process that just seems like a bad way to live a life and to the extent that you put you know much of your writing output to your own email list and in your own spaces you will get exposed to that downside risk less hmm you have this quote that I really like which is you radically underestimate both how much you know that other people do not and the instrumental benefits of you publishing it why don't you talk about the arbitrage of knowledge here and all the things that people have built up ideas around that they haven't shared but all so there certainly isn't like there's a hierarchy here so how can we identify which ideas are worth publishing and which ones are just noise what makes an idea worth publishing I think that it's useful to understand that there's like an instrumental / use value for an idea will someone be able to add to take this technology the idea that I've written down and like replicated in their own life and that is not the only value that a piece can have even though I think a lot of folks wake that particular value very highly and you know your particular way of explaining something and whether that lands with a particular audience is another dimension of value which is often underappreciated and even like I'll come back to that in a moment you're sort of persona or demographic information etc etc that would cause the idea to be accepted by people who might not accept it from another int alert interlocutor how do you pronounce that word only ever seen and that is also like another dimension of value and so there are widely more things that should be written down than actually our window the let's talk about that to add you know this might not be a new idea but it might be new to a particular audience I've had relatively few new ideas with regards to marketing over the course of my career and I think I've only ever had one actually just the one most of the other stuff has been things that have been well well-known in the marketing community and but the marketing community and the engineering community don't talk all that much and a polite way of phrasing it is that yeah Engineers are from Mars marketers are from Venus a less polite way of phrasing it is that most engineers think that marketing is exploitative [ __ ] and so a lot of what I have done over the course of my career is just explaining things that are well understood in marketing land like a be testing in such a way that the culture that is engineering doesn't dismiss them yeah and then you know like hey if you've learned enough about marketing to be dangerous you as an engineer without having to turn in your coding badge would have more organizational sway get your projects approved more often be paid radically more money have a better career outcome etcetera etc and that isn't quite an arbitrage but uh you know figuratively I suppose an arbitrage and it's fun that you know you think people would catch up after me doing it for 10 plus years that hey I'm doing is like taking Seth Godin things and then putting a you know like put a get analogy in there but it works really really well and I think I'm a tendency to be a little too self-critical and a little too self-deprecating that's perhaps more self-deprecating than I should be but there is a lot of repeated value in that and in hitting stuff day at the intersection of two ideas is that answer the question yeah would you talk to good marketers what do they still miss about what it takes to market well online what is something that to you feels like this obvious secret hidden in plain sight that even the best people aren't understanding there's been a meme the last couple of years like performance marketing is the future etc etc and we're going to rigorously measure the effect of our campaigns and double down on the ones that are winning bla bla bla bla I think that even given that and people's time allocation and their relative amount of brain sweat allocation is often determined more by well they're you know what seems to be high status either themselves through their organization what feels fun what feels like a good idea I mean like you know Google did an art installation what do we have planned for an art installation etc etc versus the things that are actually winning at the I think that caring about quality is surprisingly underrated and not just doing something because you know it was on our queue to plan to get a podcast up and running but like what is the best possible version of the podcast that and you know podcast needs staffing for music because podcasts needs to have intrinsic step back yeah what's the best possible version of the intro music Thunder etc like just that appreciation of craft is something that is under index Tom and one of the reasons I love work and strife is that there's a great deal of appreciation of craft talk of hearing more than that yep I really curious to hear it because like stripe does have an appreciation for craft and I notice it from the second I walk in last time I went to stripe HQ the woman at the front desk she had seen my photo she greeted me by name when I arrived and I was like wow then to like when I get lunch there it like the lunch is fantastic and then just talking to the people at stripe and looking at your documentation and your design there is like a level of craft that somehow stripe has avoided some kind of reversion to the mean that infects all these different kinds of companies and there's a lot of other companies particularly in Silicon Valley who get very influenced by what the data says and you can see the quality of the product actually degrading over time because I think that they're too focused on metrics and I wonder if crafted metrics are in some some way opposed or in some way of a different language and I'm wondering what does stripe do to maintain that love for craft and beauty and like care that goes into a product and my incident spit-take answer on this is it's ultimately a cultural question and then I'm remembering a great great line from one of the best books that were written about Japan which is that when people say something is a cultural question that means that they don't have a good structural explanation for it and so carrying those two ideas in my mind in in in synthesis at at the same time there there was one sense in the way that and and this is by the way certainly not a thing that we have achieved an asymptote at I think that if you were to ask people in stripe generally or senior decision makers who would definitely say that we're not happy with where our quality bar is either at any point in the past in the present not likely in the near future either and but be that as it may how do you create a culture of like caring more than the other guy we're carrying more than the median in your industry one needs to like explicitly say and model to people we care more and you know we are willing to spike a launch over impact being the best version of the launch that you know there there are mechanical ways to do this internally such that you know you don't incentive systems rule everything around me if you incentivize like hitting the schedule on time effort time it will cost people to hit the schedule every time if you incentivize shipping the best version of something you will tend to ship the best version of something those are you know - like caricatured answer the poll but you can sort of like choose where along the spectrum you you sit and you know we were relatively intentional on where on spectrum we are the being responsive to internal and external evaluations of whether something is good a thing that we do very frequently is to take so interestingly thing that I do not do in my writing personally is to show writing to people prior to it being done and I I'm mostly published to the Internet and everybody gets it at the same time that would be crazy talk at work we have multiple internal check points where we show either other people internally or sort of like trusted Outsiders hey here's an early version of an essay we're working on or early version of a landing page etc etc what do you think and and there's often the substantial lots of rework and response to feedback up to and including like we are institutionally ready to say eight people have worked on this new landing page for six months and five out of five of the trusted feedback people hated it all right throw it away you will start from scratch eccentric cetera and there there are pluses and minuses to that believe me like there's some very toothy internal real management consequences too and thank you for doing that work for the last eight months we're going to throw away throw it all the way because it was bad start over and we wouldn't face it as because it was bad but that is definitely what people might feel if you tell them we're sorting weight let's see your work so you know being willing to make those calls being like willing to back people when they make those calls being willing to back people up and down the organization and when they say no hey I'm not an original gangster strike I just joined two weeks ago and my role is not one that would normally have decision-making authority with respect to X I'm actually you know I do user operations which is a support oriented rolled stripe but I've got some thoughts with respect to this artifact and saying like yes we will listen to those thoughts because when we gave you an employee badge we were buying you know access to your brain cycles and we had we like that was separated cycles making sure that you you know like increasingly get signal from the people that have been good at doing that over like previous iterations of the game and formally or informally does that answer the question absolutely so what is it about stripe really talks about its writing first culture and I think that you show it sort of a lot of the things that we do for marketing is presented as for outsiders but in actuality it's also for insiders and with stripe press a lot of what stripe press is like with the art of doing science and engineering and Daddy AG Paul's new book and revolt to the public one of my favorite books of all time actually a lot of what stripe is trying to do I think is raise the bar of thinking both within stripe and then extending out to Silicon Valley and then hopefully for the world what is it about stripes commitment to writing and what do you think the genesis of that is what does writing so regularly do for a company so I'll make one observation which is that we have a lot of words that are available on the Internet via stripe breastfeeds stripe increment via the APIs guy is stripe blog etc etc and that if you were to just do just by word count and just by word count of long live documents I think that upwards of 99% of stripe word count would be internal rather than external so granted we have plus or minus three thousand people working at the company but that the company is you know total available corpus is massive what does that do for us so for obvious reasons I can't disclose things like the stripe growth rate in terms of either business or in terms of headcount just the way that typically described by the number of people we had a company but say hypothetically speaking a lot of businesses go well some businesses on the vet your trajectory go through a hyper growth phase and a company in a hyper growth phase might be growing at them they're doubling their number of employees every year and this has some implications which are not broadly appreciated one is that if you joined in 2016 a company that it's growing at 2 X per year the day you join half of your colleagues will have less than one year of tenure at the company one year later in 2017 half your colleagues will have less than one year of tenure at the company one year later in 2018 half of your colleagues will have one less than one year of tenure at the company continues for the duration that you're on that hyper dressed curve and so and given that your corporate existence is constantly largely weighted to people who do not have the context of having been there for a number of years we're still getting spun up as you know members of the company but while they are spun up or like you know you can't do work if half of your people can't do work so while you are like inviting the company culture and getting acclimated to how stuff is done you're producing that culture at the same time you need to have force multiplier on the sort of democracy of the dead that's the traditional way to describe history outside of companies hopefully most of your prior employees won't have died yet and it like reproducing the culture and amplifying the culture of people who were there before who might be you know numerically what's the word you know if you just go by the numbers the people who have four plus years of tenure that will be a very small portion of your employee basis if you're doubling every year but the impact that they can have by producing highly leveraged artifacts extends for years decades Exeter Exeter particularly 2010 and change the set point of the company culture and helps people like build off of that set point in the future so I don't remember where I was going with that answer um that cool that works well I like the democracy that that idea that that that that is what writing is doing it is saying from all these people who have been there before as the company grows you can still get their ideas actually you could almost use a Bitcoin metaphor that they are on the chain and they're they're sort of permanently over time even as you begin to add to the ledger over time I want to shift into talking about software companies I think that one of the ideas that I'm just ecstatically excited about is building an online audience writing online then through that actually validating demand and meeting people who could be future co-workers or future customers future investors for your company and through that actually launching small software businesses one of the things I want to do with my career is basically take hundreds of people through this path I have the writing online path now then end up having a place where people can 01:0:2,130 --> 01:0:3,729 01:0:2,140 --> 01:0:5,229 grow their audiences together and then 01:0:3,719 --> 01:0:5,229 01:0:3,729 --> 01:0:7,089 basically create some kind of Y 01:0:5,219 --> 01:0:7,089 01:0:5,229 --> 01:0:9,069 Combinator for bootstrap software 01:0:7,079 --> 01:0:9,069 01:0:7,089 --> 01:0:12,249 businesses that's the path that I'm on 01:0:9,059 --> 01:0:12,249 01:0:9,069 --> 01:0:15,699 and so my question to you is what have 01:0:12,239 --> 01:0:15,699 01:0:12,249 --> 01:0:18,640 you seen in terms of validating these 01:0:15,689 --> 01:0:18,640 01:0:15,699 --> 01:0:20,229 small software businesses and then go to 01:0:18,630 --> 01:0:20,229 01:0:18,640 --> 01:0:21,669 market strategy like should we go to 01:0:20,219 --> 01:0:21,669 01:0:20,229 --> 01:0:23,739 market once we have a hundred email 01:0:21,659 --> 01:0:23,739 01:0:21,669 --> 01:0:25,749 newsletters 5,000 email newsletters or 01:0:23,729 --> 01:0:25,749 01:0:23,739 --> 01:0:29,099 is that not the parameter that we should 01:0:25,739 --> 01:0:29,099 01:0:25,749 --> 01:0:29,099 be thinking about this at all 01:0:29,479 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:0:29,489 --> 01:0:39,999 interesting discussion and so scoping it 01:0:38,309 --> 01:0:39,999 01:0:38,319 --> 01:0:42,219 to b2b SS companies for the moment 01:0:39,989 --> 01:0:42,219 01:0:39,999 --> 01:0:45,099 because b2b SAS is the kind of software 01:0:42,209 --> 01:0:45,099 01:0:42,219 --> 01:0:46,900 that I know the best as time goes to 01:0:45,089 --> 01:0:46,900 01:0:45,099 --> 01:0:50,739 infinity every bead recess company will 01:0:46,890 --> 01:0:50,739 01:0:46,900 --> 01:0:53,619 say bong-sun ped we should have a 01:0:50,729 --> 01:0:53,619 01:0:50,739 --> 01:0:55,059 content marketing engine and every 01:0:53,609 --> 01:0:55,059 01:0:53,619 --> 01:0:57,119 content marketing engine will eventually 01:0:55,049 --> 01:0:57,119 01:0:55,059 --> 01:0:58,799 publish a book either like 01:0:57,109 --> 01:0:58,799 01:0:57,119 --> 01:1:0,779 an actual book book or something which 01:0:58,789 --> 01:1:0,779 01:0:58,799 --> 01:1:3,089 is morally equivalent to a book based on 01:1:0,769 --> 01:1:3,089 01:1:0,779 --> 01:1:5,940 you know word count degree of 01:1:3,079 --> 01:1:5,940 01:1:3,089 --> 01:1:7,440 intellectual depth Exeter Exeter and the 01:1:5,930 --> 01:1:7,440 01:1:5,940 --> 01:1:11,279 thing that I would suggest most people 01:1:7,430 --> 01:1:11,279 01:1:7,440 --> 01:1:16,200 do is to pull the Coptic marketing 01:1:11,269 --> 01:1:16,200 01:1:11,279 --> 01:1:17,910 forward and sort of like write the book 01:1:16,190 --> 01:1:17,910 01:1:16,200 --> 01:1:24,480 before writing the software if that 01:1:17,900 --> 01:1:24,480 01:1:17,910 --> 01:1:25,920 makes sense and why and one when you 01:1:24,470 --> 01:1:25,920 01:1:24,480 --> 01:1:28,740 think it's like the production functions 01:1:25,910 --> 01:1:28,740 01:1:25,920 --> 01:1:30,029 of books first to suffer it is and it 01:1:28,730 --> 01:1:30,029 01:1:28,740 --> 01:1:35,309 doesn't have to be a book book and be 01:1:30,019 --> 01:1:35,309 01:1:30,029 --> 01:1:40,380 yeah an e-book blog etc etc but broadly 01:1:35,299 --> 01:1:40,380 01:1:35,309 --> 01:1:44,549 and a resequenced that the usual 01:1:40,370 --> 01:1:44,549 01:1:40,380 --> 01:1:45,930 sequence of deliverables if you are 01:1:44,539 --> 01:1:45,930 01:1:44,549 --> 01:1:47,309 going to start a software company your 01:1:45,920 --> 01:1:47,309 01:1:45,930 --> 01:1:50,819 pop committed to doing it eventually 01:1:47,299 --> 01:1:50,819 01:1:47,309 --> 01:1:52,140 anyhow if you do it earlier it's quicker 01:1:50,809 --> 01:1:52,140 01:1:50,819 --> 01:1:53,549 to get up and running on the internet 01:1:52,130 --> 01:1:53,549 01:1:52,140 --> 01:1:54,869 and quicker to get something worthy of 01:1:53,539 --> 01:1:54,869 01:1:53,549 --> 01:1:56,549 the attention of others I've been 01:1:54,859 --> 01:1:56,549 01:1:54,869 --> 01:1:58,619 running on the internet so you get to 01:1:56,539 --> 01:1:58,619 01:1:56,549 --> 01:2:2,220 start the clock on things like Google 01:1:58,609 --> 01:2:2,220 01:1:58,619 --> 01:2:3,749 give me your domain some authority if 01:2:2,210 --> 01:2:3,749 01:2:2,220 --> 01:2:5,569 start to clock on things like social 01:2:3,739 --> 01:2:5,569 01:2:3,749 --> 01:2:7,499 application via social media and 01:2:5,559 --> 01:2:7,499 01:2:5,569 --> 01:2:9,749 attracting people to your banner on 01:2:7,489 --> 01:2:9,749 01:2:7,499 --> 01:2:11,940 getting newsletter subscribers cetera et 01:2:9,739 --> 01:2:11,940 01:2:9,749 --> 01:2:14,480 cetera earlier those things tend to 01:2:11,930 --> 01:2:14,480 01:2:11,940 --> 01:2:16,499 compound over time both time that 01:2:14,470 --> 01:2:16,499 01:2:14,480 --> 01:2:17,940 there's the distinction between wall 01:2:16,489 --> 01:2:17,940 01:2:16,499 --> 01:2:19,829 clock time the amount of time that you 01:2:17,930 --> 01:2:19,829 01:2:17,940 --> 01:2:21,029 were sitting at your desk periodically 01:2:19,819 --> 01:2:21,029 01:2:19,829 --> 01:2:23,819 looking at the clock and doing the work 01:2:21,019 --> 01:2:23,819 01:2:21,029 --> 01:2:25,920 and calendar time just some things like 01:2:23,809 --> 01:2:25,920 01:2:23,819 --> 01:2:28,799 Google Authority take just a while to 01:2:25,910 --> 01:2:28,799 01:2:25,920 --> 01:2:30,289 bake regardless of whether you're like 01:2:28,789 --> 01:2:30,289 01:2:28,799 --> 01:2:34,619 physically hands on keyboard during it 01:2:30,279 --> 01:2:34,619 01:2:30,289 --> 01:2:37,619 and if you sequence those activities 01:2:34,609 --> 01:2:37,619 01:2:34,619 --> 01:2:39,329 earlier you get to have more 01:2:37,609 --> 01:2:39,329 01:2:37,619 --> 01:2:41,309 opportunities to go through the learning 01:2:39,319 --> 01:2:41,309 01:2:39,329 --> 01:2:42,989 loop more opportunities for value to 01:2:41,299 --> 01:2:42,989 01:2:41,309 --> 01:2:45,989 compound over a longer period of time 01:2:42,979 --> 01:2:45,989 01:2:42,989 --> 01:2:47,630 versus sequencing them later you know if 01:2:45,979 --> 01:2:47,630 01:2:45,989 --> 01:2:49,710 you spend nine months in the code gave 01:2:47,620 --> 01:2:49,710 01:2:47,630 --> 01:2:50,970 building out version 1.0 of your 01:2:49,700 --> 01:2:50,970 01:2:49,710 --> 01:2:52,589 software and then launch to nobody 01:2:50,960 --> 01:2:52,589 01:2:50,970 --> 01:2:55,489 that's nine months where you could have 01:2:52,579 --> 01:2:55,489 01:2:52,589 --> 01:2:57,450 you know had developed a newsletter with 01:2:55,479 --> 01:2:57,450 01:2:55,489 --> 01:3:2,670 thousands of people subscribing to it 01:2:57,440 --> 01:3:2,670 01:2:57,450 --> 01:3:4,349 and then nine months after that with 01:3:2,660 --> 01:3:4,349 01:3:2,670 --> 01:3:6,299 relatively little additional work done 01:3:4,339 --> 01:3:6,299 01:3:4,349 --> 01:3:8,750 and the newsletter had like people ready 01:3:6,289 --> 01:3:8,750 01:3:6,299 --> 01:3:13,010 to buy everything on the first day 01:3:8,740 --> 01:3:13,010 01:3:8,750 --> 01:3:14,830 so that is the first thing I would 01:3:13,000 --> 01:3:14,830 01:3:13,010 --> 01:3:17,140 suggest is like 01:3:14,820 --> 01:3:17,140 01:3:14,830 --> 01:3:19,190 rethink the mindset of becoming a 01:3:17,130 --> 01:3:19,190 01:3:17,140 --> 01:3:21,350 software person who writes and think 01:3:19,180 --> 01:3:21,350 01:3:19,190 --> 01:3:24,230 more about like becoming the expert and 01:3:21,340 --> 01:3:24,230 01:3:21,350 --> 01:3:25,850 then writing the software that that sort 01:3:24,220 --> 01:3:25,850 01:3:24,230 --> 01:3:28,040 of like encodes your expertise in the 01:3:25,840 --> 01:3:28,040 01:3:25,850 --> 01:3:30,200 software product I think that really 01:3:28,030 --> 01:3:30,200 01:3:28,040 --> 01:3:32,510 writing deeply about how you understand 01:3:30,190 --> 01:3:32,510 01:3:30,200 --> 01:3:34,070 whatever your problem domain is will 01:3:32,500 --> 01:3:34,070 01:3:32,510 --> 01:3:38,360 make your software product decisions 01:3:34,060 --> 01:3:38,360 01:3:34,070 --> 01:3:41,870 letter and I think that a company that 01:3:38,350 --> 01:3:41,870 01:3:38,360 --> 01:3:44,690 brings us into sharp relief is base camp 01:3:41,860 --> 01:3:44,690 01:3:41,870 --> 01:3:48,110 and base camp to products as well but if 01:3:44,680 --> 01:3:48,110 01:3:44,690 --> 01:3:49,820 you look at their Jason Frieda recently 01:3:48,100 --> 01:3:49,820 01:3:48,110 -->

01:3:58,910 is this new upstart email client and 01:3:54,660 --> 01:3:58,910 01:3:54,670 --> 01:4:0,500 like there's there's a fascinating 01:3:58,900 --> 01:4:0,500 01:3:58,910 --> 01:4:5,570 fascinating document just done like 01:4:0,490 --> 01:4:5,570 01:4:0,500 --> 01:4:8,300 great product thinking and yeah a lot of 01:4:5,560 --> 01:4:8,300 01:4:5,570 --> 01:4:10,160 that is like great thinking of the job 01:4:8,290 --> 01:4:10,160 01:4:8,300 --> 01:4:15,040 to be done of email and how people use 01:4:10,150 --> 01:4:15,040 01:4:10,160 --> 01:4:18,830 email in terms of like workflows and 01:4:15,030 --> 01:4:18,830 01:4:15,040 --> 01:4:22,580 what the like what situations that fits 01:4:18,820 --> 01:4:22,580 01:4:18,830 --> 01:4:24,320 into in their life and a lot of people 01:4:22,570 --> 01:4:24,320 01:4:22,580 --> 01:4:26,570 if they like just start from a software 01:4:24,310 --> 01:4:26,570 01:4:24,320 --> 01:4:29,900 perspective of okay I need to write a 01:4:26,560 --> 01:4:29,900 01:4:26,570 --> 01:4:31,940 workflow engine for throwing my own 01:4:29,890 --> 01:4:31,940 01:4:29,900 --> 01:4:33,470 products under the bus and appointment 01:4:31,930 --> 01:4:33,470 01:4:31,940 --> 01:4:35,300 management for dental offices it's like 01:4:33,460 --> 01:4:35,300 01:4:33,470 --> 01:4:38,240 okay well I'm going to need to have like 01:4:35,290 --> 01:4:38,240 01:4:35,300 --> 01:4:39,890 some way to create customers for this in 01:4:38,230 --> 01:4:39,890 01:4:38,240 --> 01:4:41,420 some way to like create point miss I'll 01:4:39,880 --> 01:4:41,420 01:4:39,890 --> 01:4:45,530 need some counter greater than yada yada 01:4:41,410 --> 01:4:45,530 01:4:41,420 --> 01:4:46,880 yada if I were to receive once the order 01:4:45,520 --> 01:4:46,880 01:4:45,530 --> 01:4:49,250 of operations and that company and say 01:4:46,870 --> 01:4:49,250 01:4:46,880 --> 01:4:52,340 okay no first I'm going to thoroughly 01:4:49,240 --> 01:4:52,340 01:4:49,250 --> 01:4:53,840 dive into Li the challenges that dental 01:4:52,330 --> 01:4:53,840 01:4:52,340 --> 01:4:54,980 offices have with regards to appointment 01:4:53,830 --> 01:4:54,980 01:4:53,840 --> 01:4:58,250 management and what that does in their 01:4:54,970 --> 01:4:58,250 01:4:54,980 --> 01:5:0,140 business and that would like cost me to 01:4:58,240 --> 01:5:0,140 01:4:58,250 --> 01:5:2,810 you know think much more deeply I'm like 01:5:0,130 --> 01:5:2,810 01:5:0,140 --> 01:5:4,670 what is the Sociology around changing an 01:5:2,800 --> 01:5:4,670 01:5:2,810 --> 01:5:6,290 appointment time what are the sort of 01:5:4,660 --> 01:5:6,290 01:5:4,670 --> 01:5:8,060 events that cause customers to cancel 01:5:6,280 --> 01:5:8,060 01:5:6,290 --> 01:5:10,580 how do you get ahead of those events and 01:5:8,050 --> 01:5:10,580 01:5:8,060 --> 01:5:12,350 how do dentists get appointments in the 01:5:10,570 --> 01:5:12,350 01:5:10,580 --> 01:5:14,690 first place was something I had no 01:5:12,340 --> 01:5:14,690 01:5:12,350 --> 01:5:15,950 understanding of when the first day that 01:5:14,680 --> 01:5:15,950 01:5:14,690 --> 01:5:17,840 appointment reminder open for business 01:5:15,940 --> 01:5:17,840 01:5:15,950 --> 01:5:21,890 which would have been a useful thing to 01:5:17,830 --> 01:5:21,890 01:5:17,840 --> 01:5:23,320 know and and so like building a software 01:5:21,880 --> 01:5:23,320 01:5:21,890 --> 01:5:26,270 01:5:23,310 --> 01:5:26,270 01:5:23,320 --> 01:5:29,300 that you know you've put in your brain 01:5:26,260 --> 01:5:29,300 01:5:26,270 --> 01:5:30,980 push-ups and have a serious mind of how 01:5:29,290 --> 01:5:30,980 01:5:29,300 --> 01:5:33,200 the user will use it well time to create 01:5:30,970 --> 01:5:33,200 01:5:30,980 --> 01:5:35,300 better software and also give you more 01:5:33,190 --> 01:5:35,300 01:5:33,200 --> 01:5:37,820 of marketing assets to start marketing 01:5:35,290 --> 01:5:37,820 01:5:35,300 --> 01:5:40,490 and selling the software on day one so 01:5:37,810 --> 01:5:40,490 01:5:37,820 --> 01:5:42,710 some of the things that I was just on 01:5:40,480 --> 01:5:42,710 01:5:40,490 --> 01:5:44,180 folks that are going from the that 01:5:42,700 --> 01:5:44,180 01:5:42,710 --> 01:5:47,470 transition from writing about something 01:5:44,170 --> 01:5:47,470 01:5:44,180 --> 01:5:48,770 to building a software product 01:5:47,460 --> 01:5:48,770 01:5:47,470 --> 01:5:53,870 demonstrates it 01:5:48,760 --> 01:5:53,870 01:5:48,770 --> 01:5:55,250 I'm also say like the the level of work 01:5:53,860 --> 01:5:55,250 01:5:53,870 --> 01:5:57,140 you have to do to create the minimum 01:5:55,240 --> 01:5:57,140 01:5:55,250 --> 01:5:58,790 viable saleable software product is 01:5:57,130 --> 01:5:58,790 01:5:57,140 --> 01:6:0,380 relatively high everyone to the level of 01:5:58,780 --> 01:6:0,380 01:5:58,790 --> 01:6:2,870 work that you need to do to create the 01:6:0,370 --> 01:6:2,870 01:6:0,380 --> 01:6:7,670 minimum valuable sellable word product 01:6:2,860 --> 01:6:7,670 01:6:2,870 --> 01:6:11,660 and they you know interviews with the 01:6:7,660 --> 01:6:11,660 01:6:7,670 --> 01:6:14,600 industry experts become a totally 01:6:11,650 --> 01:6:14,600 01:6:11,660 --> 01:6:16,640 sellable ebook in under weeks of work it 01:6:14,590 --> 01:6:16,640 01:6:14,600 --> 01:6:19,640 would be extremely difficult to have a 01:6:16,630 --> 01:6:19,640 01:6:16,640 --> 01:6:21,800 modern SAS app that was baked enough for 01:6:19,630 --> 01:6:21,800 01:6:19,640 --> 01:6:24,050 production use within weeks of work and 01:6:21,790 --> 01:6:24,050 01:6:21,800 --> 01:6:26,450 yet you can get people to pay you $50 01:6:24,040 --> 01:6:26,450 01:6:24,050 --> 01:6:29,060 for interviews or for any book that 01:6:26,440 --> 01:6:29,060 01:6:26,450 --> 01:6:31,010 describes your method or any of a number 01:6:29,050 --> 01:6:31,010 01:6:29,060 --> 01:6:35,600 of other artifacts that are primarily 01:6:31,000 --> 01:6:35,600 01:6:31,010 --> 01:6:37,820 writing and that both them like money 01:6:35,590 --> 01:6:37,820 01:6:35,600 --> 01:6:39,290 money is a nice thing to have it allows 01:6:37,810 --> 01:6:39,290 01:6:37,820 --> 01:6:42,290 you to buy things that are useful in 01:6:39,280 --> 01:6:42,290 01:6:39,290 --> 01:6:46,010 accelerating your business also rent a 01:6:42,280 --> 01:6:46,010 01:6:42,290 --> 01:6:47,930 cool thing and it also trains people to 01:6:46,000 --> 01:6:47,930 01:6:46,010 --> 01:6:50,120 pay you money with regards to the 01:6:47,920 --> 01:6:50,120 01:6:47,930 --> 01:6:52,880 subject that you have so the second time 01:6:50,110 --> 01:6:52,880 01:6:50,120 --> 01:6:54,350 you ask them for much more money you're 01:6:52,870 --> 01:6:54,350 01:6:52,880 --> 01:6:56,300 not getting them over the penny gap 01:6:54,340 --> 01:6:56,300 01:6:54,350 --> 01:6:58,250 again it's like well I paid this person 01:6:56,290 --> 01:6:58,250 01:6:56,300 --> 01:7:0,350 $50 for an e-book or should I read about 01:6:58,240 --> 01:7:0,350 01:6:58,250 --> 01:7:1,610 the subject they seem to know what 01:7:0,340 --> 01:7:1,610 01:7:0,350 --> 01:7:3,650 they're talking about in that ebook now 01:7:1,600 --> 01:7:3,650 01:7:1,610 --> 01:7:5,810 I will do the additional work of no 01:7:3,640 --> 01:7:5,810 01:7:3,650 --> 01:7:7,430 pushing them through the whatever the 01:7:5,800 --> 01:7:7,430 01:7:5,810 --> 01:7:9,230 process is at my company if we're green 01:7:7,420 --> 01:7:9,230 01:7:7,430 --> 01:7:12,290 lighting a new software product first 01:7:9,220 --> 01:7:12,290 01:7:9,230 --> 01:7:14,360 it's like ah I really want to have a 01:7:12,280 --> 01:7:14,360 01:7:12,290 --> 01:7:16,820 discussion with like security team I'm 01:7:14,350 --> 01:7:16,820 01:7:14,360 --> 01:7:19,730 getting this approved is that worth my 01:7:16,810 --> 01:7:19,730 01:7:16,820 --> 01:7:21,950 time I do want to put this this software 01:7:19,720 --> 01:7:21,950 01:7:19,730 --> 01:7:23,240 trial through its paces etc etc it's 01:7:21,940 --> 01:7:23,240 01:7:21,950 --> 01:7:26,060 sort of like pre answering sales 01:7:23,230 --> 01:7:26,060 01:7:23,240 --> 01:7:27,680 objections via producing written 01:7:26,050 --> 01:7:27,680 01:7:26,060 --> 01:7:29,540 artifacts they can actually buy versus 01:7:27,670 --> 01:7:29,540 01:7:27,680 --> 01:7:32,660 going directly into you southern I'm a 01:7:29,530 --> 01:7:32,660 01:7:29,540 --> 01:7:34,400 software based artifact what is you know 01:7:32,650 --> 01:7:34,400 01:7:32,660 --> 01:7:36,280 you had a thread about zero down a 01:7:34,390 --> 01:7:36,280 01:7:34,400 --> 01:7:39,790 couple months ago what is a 01:7:36,270 --> 01:7:39,790 01:7:36,280 --> 01:7:42,250 small software business that you admire 01:7:39,780 --> 01:7:42,250 01:7:39,790 --> 01:7:45,670 and talk about how they use online 01:7:42,240 --> 01:7:45,670 01:7:42,250 --> 01:7:46,930 writing and content to actually grow and 01:7:45,660 --> 01:7:46,930 01:7:45,670 --> 01:7:49,060 validate the business and be really 01:7:46,920 --> 01:7:49,060 01:7:46,930 --> 01:7:51,040 interesting to get an example of some of 01:7:49,050 --> 01:7:51,040 01:7:49,060 --> 01:7:52,780 the things that you're saying and it'd 01:7:51,030 --> 01:7:52,780 01:7:51,040 --> 01:7:53,860 be even better if it's a company that we 01:7:52,770 --> 01:7:53,860 01:7:52,780 --> 01:7:55,600 haven't heard of because I think that 01:7:53,850 --> 01:7:55,600 01:7:53,860 --> 01:7:58,450 that proves the point well that one of 01:7:55,590 --> 01:7:58,450 01:7:55,600 --> 01:8:0,250 you like to say that the amount of money 01:7:58,440 --> 01:8:0,250 01:7:58,450 --> 01:8:3,490 that's flowing through capitalism would 01:8:0,240 --> 01:8:3,490 01:8:0,250 --> 01:8:6,850 astound you and I think that the reason 01:8:3,480 --> 01:8:6,850 01:8:3,490 --> 01:8:9,550 why I love that is it's so the inverse 01:8:6,840 --> 01:8:9,550 01:8:6,850 --> 01:8:11,620 of how a lot of us grow up oh there are 01:8:9,540 --> 01:8:11,620 01:8:9,550 --> 01:8:13,420 six main jobs that you're gonna go into 01:8:11,610 --> 01:8:13,420 01:8:11,620 --> 01:8:15,670 it could be Investment Banking 01:8:13,410 --> 01:8:15,670 01:8:13,420 --> 01:8:17,589 management consulting accounting yada 01:8:15,660 --> 01:8:17,589 01:8:15,670 --> 01:8:20,170 yada yada but I think that what I've 01:8:17,579 --> 01:8:20,170 01:8:17,589 --> 01:8:21,790 taken from you quite a bit is actually 01:8:20,160 --> 01:8:21,790 01:8:20,170 --> 01:8:24,490 the number of options available to you 01:8:21,780 --> 01:8:24,490 01:8:21,790 --> 01:8:28,750 is way bigger than you think and give us 01:8:24,480 --> 01:8:28,750 01:8:24,490 --> 01:8:31,780 an example of what you mean by that so 01:8:28,740 --> 01:8:31,780 01:8:28,750 --> 01:8:34,330 somebody who is not me coined McGann 01:8:31,770 --> 01:8:34,330 01:8:31,780 --> 01:8:36,819 again is a colleague of mine is stripe 01:8:34,320 --> 01:8:36,819 01:8:34,330 --> 01:8:40,180 but he's left to other adventures coined 01:8:36,809 --> 01:8:40,180 01:8:36,819 --> 01:8:43,720 petiole evans law and which is funny 01:8:40,170 --> 01:8:43,720 01:8:40,180 --> 01:8:45,430 like no endorsement implied but I think 01:8:43,710 --> 01:8:45,430 01:8:43,720 --> 01:8:48,160 he's probably right on this said that 01:8:45,420 --> 01:8:48,160 01:8:45,430 --> 01:8:50,500 the the number of software businesses in 01:8:48,150 --> 01:8:50,500 01:8:48,160 --> 01:8:52,270 the world is larger than you think even 01:8:50,490 --> 01:8:52,270 01:8:50,500 --> 01:8:54,339 after you've taken into effect patio 01:8:52,260 --> 01:8:54,339 01:8:52,270 --> 01:8:58,920 limbs law taken into account patio lands 01:8:54,329 --> 01:8:58,920 01:8:54,339 --> 01:9:2,260 law and so there's tens of thousands of 01:8:58,910 --> 01:9:2,260 01:8:58,920 --> 01:9:4,810 extremely healthy software / SAS 01:9:2,250 --> 01:9:4,810 01:9:2,260 --> 01:9:6,609 businesses which you've never heard of 01:9:4,800 --> 01:9:6,609 01:9:4,810 --> 01:9:9,250 in which most people will never hear of 01:9:6,599 --> 01:9:9,250 01:9:6,609 --> 01:9:11,890 and they will like the business will be 01:9:9,240 --> 01:9:11,890 01:9:9,250 --> 01:9:13,750 born it will successfully satisfy 01:9:11,880 --> 01:9:13,750 01:9:11,890 --> 01:9:16,270 customers it will grow for years it will 01:9:13,740 --> 01:9:16,270 01:9:13,750 --> 01:9:18,100 get sold and at no point will it ever be 01:9:16,260 --> 01:9:18,100 01:9:16,270 --> 01:9:22,270 legible to someone who is not a customer 01:9:18,090 --> 01:9:22,270 01:9:18,100 --> 01:9:23,740 or employee of it and you know stripe 01:9:22,260 --> 01:9:23,740 01:9:22,270 --> 01:9:25,569 that's sort of a privileged vantage 01:9:23,730 --> 01:9:25,569 01:9:23,740 --> 01:9:26,859 points on this some people who are 01:9:25,559 --> 01:9:26,859 01:9:25,569 --> 01:9:29,520 investors or business brokers have 01:9:26,849 --> 01:9:29,520 01:9:26,859 --> 01:9:32,230 privileged vantage points on this I've 01:9:29,510 --> 01:9:32,230 01:9:29,520 --> 01:9:34,839 been obsessed with this topic for many 01:9:32,220 --> 01:9:34,839 01:9:32,230 --> 01:9:37,510 many years just like take this from 01:9:34,829 --> 01:9:37,510 01:9:34,839 --> 01:9:40,060 faith that when when you think of like 01:9:37,500 --> 01:9:40,060 01:9:37,510 --> 01:9:42,010 you know Electrical examples even 01:9:40,050 --> 01:9:42,010 01:9:40,060 --> 01:9:46,420 legible examples from yours truly of 01:9:42,000 --> 01:9:46,420 01:9:42,010 --> 01:9:49,510 somebody who has you know a firm that 01:9:46,410 --> 01:9:49,510 01:9:46,420 --> 01:9:49,989 has done the writing to bootstrap a 01:9:49,500 --> 01:9:49,989 01:9:49,510 --> 01:9:54,849 business 01:9:49,979 --> 01:9:54,849 01:9:49,989 --> 01:9:56,920 and done well by doing that the best 01:9:54,839 --> 01:9:56,920 01:9:54,849 --> 01:9:58,449 informed person that that could tell you 01:9:56,910 --> 01:9:58,449 01:9:56,920 --> 01:10:0,460 about examples like that is only 01:9:58,439 --> 01:10:0,460 01:9:58,449 --> 01:10:1,539 scratching the surface of how many people who have used that tactic successfully that said Basecamp is often thrown out as a as an example here and I think far too many people say well you know Basecamp is internet famous and so that isn't a replicable strategy but Basecamp is internet famous because they like you know had no blog then they had a blog and they continued writing for that blog for a while and internet-famous is just the past tense of wrote a blog for ten years the convertkit is another example convertkit is a company by nathan berry which does email marketing for writers I think they have different definitions of writers but I would probably save writers creators etc etc and they that was an outgrowth of Nathan's own efforts doing he wrote a series of ebooks for the design community ebooks and other information oriented products for the design community and then he broke one book about the business of doing training products called Authority and said that you know the marketing and sales engine behind training products tends to be heavily email oriented and so Authority talked a lot about like its tactical use of email and then he was like uh-huh you know I should really like build the email service that would exist if somebody was making email service specifically for people that were following this playbook that I just wrote and so that eventually became convertkit and convertkit is doing fabulously well and yet like convertkit is in some quarters and in a famous there are companies that are less than err and a famous and I'll throw out an example more aware more aware rakes it makes essentially in ERP for kitchen countertop installers which is a section of the the US economy and and if you've never installed a new countertop in your kitchen you might be under estimating price points but suffice it to say that a lot of money happens in you know milk glass homes around kitchen remodeling Sunu and so there is a large heavily distributed industry of mostly mountain competences that i have some extremely like difficult planning and resource management questions around like you know if you don't buy the right amount of granite at the store and it is not cut into the right amount of shapes your going to get to the kitchen and be extremely sad because like you know physics and math will impose upon you the impossibility of delivering the kitchen table you have contracted to deliver and so shouldn't you use more software than you have previously and so more aware is that software and they do quite well for themselves and for anything that you can think of that is like I don't think that kitchen kitchen countertop installation is like the Platonic minima of the size of business that you need to be to support a software business you know and there are multiple competing viable software businesses in like cemetery management that not funeral management's that's an entirely separate industry just like laying out cemeteries and you know ensuring that you like that somebody can manage the sales process for them the maintance process for them etc etc and throw a dart board threw a dart board threw a dart at the dart board is the economy if it hits a business it has a w-2 employee in it at like that business will at scales consume billions of dollars to suffer and there are many many many like fractal ecosystems upon ecosystems of companies that are selling into these businesses and so it is a wonderful wonderful time to be alive and suffer that's a wonderful answer thank you you've lived in Japan for a long time now what is the number one thing that you would like to export from Japanese culture in terms of tacit knowledge of what we can learn from whether it's Japanese craftsmanship engineering culture elegance music what is it whoo it's a very complicated question I'll say is the person with the East Asian Studies degree I'll have to give the disclaimer that there is no one Japanese culture any more than there is one American culture and that the degree of homogeneity of Japan's culture is largely overstated that said there it's also not the case that there is no such thing as an American culture so some broad themes I think that exists in pockets in the United States and exists at more than pockets in Japan is a level of earnestness and optimism with respect to once work I think that is broadly a healthy attitude for a society to have and one that I wish we've replicated more broadly and I think Silicon Valley gets close to close to this in a lot of places although the sort of like learned cynicism of the US educated classes has started to infect Silicon Valley in some ways but I'll give you an anecdote not that the anecdote is so representative of the whole but I once met a man at a mall in ogaki I oekaki in the town that I lived in and he was there at a crafts fair in the mall and his craft was sharpening scissors not making scissors that's a different company he was just the scissor sharpening guy and he had spent 40 years of his life getting darn good at sharpening scissors and he talked to me for 45 minutes about the craft of sharpening scissors his argument for why no household should have less than 3 pairs of scissors because you can keep scissors and like different states of sharpening and it's like clearly like you would never use a fabric scissors on paper well you wouldn't want a sharp cuts I'm not using using the right words but like you would want one pair of scissors for sharp cuts on paper and one pair of scissors for more rough cuts on paper like clearly you would not use these these two things in the wrong place why would you do that and just like the level of passion he had about sharpening scissors defeats the level of passion most people have not just for most things but probably for anything and like a culture that has created a space where someone can say without a trace of irony I have devoted my career to being the best possible sharpener of scissors is doing something right and like not ironic embrace of just loving what you do is that feels like a free lunch that the US and various other places could import from Japan and there are many cultural socio-political etc cos that are reasons why when someone says I not ironically love what I do for a living why you know sophisticated people in positions of authority would say oh that's just what capitalists want you to believe but loving what you do is super power both with respect to increasing your ability to do what you do well and also them get results out of what you want to do well get better at what you want to do well and just being like happier with life such that you know all else being equal choose to loves it the thing that you do that is a choice available to you which interestingly is not the same advice as choose to do it you love I think the advice choose to do what you love is generally bad advice because that will cost more people to want to be like professional World of Warcraft players and the market demand for World of Warcraft players is like lower relative to the you know market demand for whatever that my job title is right now and so I'm all else being equal I'm happy that I sell software for living and don't play World work for a living so talk about that so within selling software for a living I don't imagine that when you were five years old and maybe you went off to your first day of kindergarten they when somebody asked what you wanted to do and all your friends said I don't be a baseball player I want to be a ballerina I want to be a firefighter I can't imagine that you said I want to tell and be the foremost world expert on how to sell nice subscription as a software service software products how does it do from from from being a kid to then now developing a love for the craft and the the dedication that you bring to your writing into your work at stripe so it would have been a singularly interestingly calibrated five-year-old to say I want to be a niche software sales expert I was an interestingly calibrated five-year-old my actual answer was I wanted to be the Commissioner of weights and measures but the yeah choosing the road less traveled since 1987 and so I sort of and not to make this set too much of the tell stories from years past our but I fell backwards since the thing that I'm doing right now and the sort of like continuing to travel up that gradient of what did we find yourself doing at find the parts of it that you'd like and double down more on those parts that you like and the parts that you know are in that fun intersection of the things that you like things you're good at things that people want from you and the things that they you know the world is willing to pay for but continue to travel up that gradient has worked reasonably well for me over the years there is as someone who is in a career situation for plus or minus six years where I was not enjoying what I was doing and I was sort of like intellectually aware on any given Monday morning I'm going to do something that I furtively disliked today and that's kind of on me because I could you know make a choice to not do this I would not have to do this for next Monday morning but I avoided making that choice for again six years of my life and life's too short you know make make obvious improvements perhaps earlier than then I did that and you know if not next Monday's new day you know if you're if you're not loving what you're doing right now either figure out the parts of what you're doing right now that you can love for I figure out ways to to alter your situation such that you can be doing things that you enjoy more or that you can make yourself enjoy more I think people underestimate the ability that they have to change and like change the way that they look about things and one of the interesting parts about stripe cultures like stripe hires for well who are ambitious and straight hires for people who are optimists and being around a lot of ambitious optimist tends to make you both more ambitious and we're optimistic and you know one would think that one's level of like resting state level of optimism resting states level of ambition is like relatively constant over the course of your life and having you know 15 plus years of experience on the Senate say actually no I think one is surprisingly able to just to become more ambitious or to just say you know starting oh I think I'm going to be more ambitious than it was previously and so the self can Bella's Valley rational set would say like self modify you know recompile your own code to be more X like recompile your own code to you know like what you do more is an option available and solution sets and like perhaps you should do that and if you find yourself doing something that it's like no I'm just fundamentally incompatible the thing that I the thing that I do for work is not something that I would love or love and like consider changing that last question you once said and I think this ties everything that we've discussed together and I've taken this to heart that VM out of luck that you have in life is how much value you create times how many people you tell about it why don't you wrap this conversation up in a bowtie by explaining what you mean by that let me give a shout out to the texting podcast which first articulated the idea to me and their idea their framing for it was the luck surface area by the way texting made their own luck by putting a name on that piece of advice and then by getting into my ears such that I just told you about the texting podcast and like 99% of you have probably not heard about it observation out of the way the it is too easy to like hide your lamp under a bushel or whatever the cliche is to think that you know I'm just going to do the best work possible and I will naturally be rewarded for that and the the world is not set up to reward people just for doing great work there's an incentive structure around you there are decision makers around that who will largely not be apprised of the value you're creating unless you make it your mission to also apprise them of the value of that at the same time you know being a professional like social-media influencer and the topic of influencing people as seems to be like a way to under create value versus actually doing something which produces value for the worlds and then promoting the fact of that value creation versus just promoting the fact of promotion yeah unless you're a PR professional and so the eight you sort of have to balance full sense of this and you also have to kind of this is another thing where you know recalibrate your own understanding and I I'm a very modest person I was raised in an environment where one is heavily discouraged from Tooting once on horn etc etc I think I've talked to a lot of people from various various personal professional backgrounds for the best case and I am I come from a community where self-promotion quote-unquote is heavily discouraged self-promotion is kind of like self cooking if you don't do it you don't pay somebody to do it and you know you aren't family with somebody who's going to do it for you then you're gonna go hungry so I understand that you probably need to consider that to be one of one of your professional skills that you probably need to get good at doing it and there's good ways to do it there's less good ways to do it but you know that's something which is ultimately going to fall on you and similarly like you're going to probably if you are employed by someone you're going to need to own your own career advancement versus expecting like management to decide based on your contributions that are out that you are ready for that next step thank hopefully they will be doing that too but have a written record available which is ready to show them the great value that you've created I'm have actually produced that great value and be advancing that favorite sorry be asking that conversation forward periodically and so yeah I probably take ownership over your own your own outcomes over the various different facets of creating this value that you'll create in the world optimized for creating more value and optimized for doing it over a very long arc of your career and things will not gonna would tend to work out for you Patrick McKenzie that was fantastic thank you
