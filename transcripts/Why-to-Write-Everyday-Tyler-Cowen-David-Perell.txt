why did you settle on an 11 30 bedtime i think on average it's more like 11 26 but that's when i'm tired maybe that's the silly answer but it's a pretty good one what time do you wake up it depends on the season uh but typically seven and then i wake up a little earlier in the summer a little later in the winter right uh but not by much and i write in the morning first thing i do is go through uh most but not all of my messages i don't respond to everyone right away that would take too much time but i see where i'm at for the day and then i start into writing pretty quickly so what does that mean where i'm at for the day that would imply that you plan your days every single day sort of new and that there's not a lot of planning going on in your life is a tricky word i would say it's in intense extreme planning uh but planning to have a lot of open space there's an earlier mark and recent essay which he's now kind of repudiated where he says well the way you should try to schedule is leave open a lot of time and then do important things at the last minute and have big blocks of time for thinking writing or for him programming perhaps in his earlier life and i've still managed to do a version of that and that works for me but if i think of writing is the most important thing i do i do that just every single morning it depends on the year maybe in a lot of years there's 15 to 20 mornings or i just can't write that morning the most common cause of that would be in the old days at 9 00 am plane flight and then i won't write that morning maybe won't write that day but otherwise every morning right total religion saturday sunday christmas day my birthday i don't care do it no exceptions if you write every day you don't even have to worry about how much you've written it's going to add up and furthermore the regularity of the habit pushes you along a learning curve so you'll get more done each day and i'm still moving along that curve so i want to dive into that but let's start by saying that in your writing one of the things that you do a lot is lay out the arguments of views that you disagree with why is that so productive you understand the views better you also start sympathizing with those people more you begin to realize they might be right and you might be wrong it makes your own arguments better and sometimes you'll change your mind so if you're only just writing out the same tired version of some point that's probably true you become stupider so the natural inclination past a certain age which is not that big a number is to become stupider de facto and you do that by saying the same thing even if it's right so i've always wanted to avoid that and i think you asked earlier like what are your kind of different special tricks and the first i said was just having been at it a long time but i would say that's another one like really being willing to entertain and indeed write out different points of view and a lot of that i do on marginal revolution but some of it is just stuff that never comes out anywhere what percentage of what you write do you publish i'm not sure uh it's become higher maybe that's worrying but uh a typical book there's half of what gets published that doesn't make it into the book on average and uh i guess i think it's worse or it may be in a few cases too speculative which is a different kind of worse but usually just like too boring or a little trivial or just like wouldn't think it had a chance of being in the top half of the book and look people have enough pages of me if that's if they want to read all of it so just giving them more pages from their point of view i don't think is a high return
