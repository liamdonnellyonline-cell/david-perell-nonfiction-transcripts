well welcome um i have been following woop for a while and now seeing your ads on television and my first question for you is what is a piece of data that you wish that you had that you're annoyed you're frustrated that you don't have it that would make tracking performance in the human body much easier and more effective well that's a good question i guess if i could uh wave a magic wand it would probably be it it would be to know everything that someone has consumed in great detail like i think that i think that nutrition is a very interesting piece of the puzzle but i think it's it's really hard to collect nutritional information one in a convenient way and two accurately and so uh i think that that as a data set also would be probably quite a differentiated data set from what we're already collecting uh at woop yeah one of the things you do is you ask deliberate questions were you on your phone before you went to sleep what time did you go to sleep what time was your last meal what do you see in terms of the efficacy of asking people for stated responses and how much that varies from what they actually do well it it does seem like the people who answer the journal that you just referred to you know so we have this this journal in the woop app that can let you track 60 to 70 different lifestyle decisions behaviors diets things of that nature the people who answer that answer it every single day so it's very binary and what what's good about that is that it gives you a you know a fairly robust data set the key in general i think with data is that you don't want there to be holes in it uh one of the reasons that woop has a uh a modular charger right you can charge whoop without ever taking it off your body was that we were obsessed with this idea that you need the data 24 7. and in fact if you had to take the loop strap off your body that would be a period of time when you weren't wearing the product and in turn we were afraid that that you might not put it back on and so that's just one of many uh reasons or one of many solutions for why continuous data is is so important and when someone's actually willing to tell you every single day how you know how much alcohol they had and at what time and the number of glasses you can actually really triangulate around uh around different people's habits and and how to optimize them one thing that's been very interesting about alcohol alcohol in general is uh not good for you most people know that but it's actually quite interesting a certain population of people on whoop if they have one drink it actually can be beneficial to them where they may see positive results in their recovery and their sleep the next day the challenge is that that that's one not it's not everyone and two a lot of people don't just have one drink it might drift into two or three and at that point it almost definitely is is having a negative impact on your body i bring that up because it just gets to the power the power of being able to change someone's behavior which at the end of the day is what woop is really trying to do we want to change behavior and improve health the power to being able to do that is to say if you are going to drink alcohol do it three hours before bed and try to have less than two drinks or so you know to be very direct and that's feedback for david and maybe for um you know rory mcilroy it's like you can't have any alcohol uh he he jokes on on our podcast that that having one glass of wine has data is completely screwed up so these things are like super personalized and i think that's why uh it's powerful to get as much data as you can to make a robust story your podcast with rory is one of the best podcasts i've listened to in my life and what i remember so vividly was the way that his composure changed after he blew it at augusta and then when he won the us open by six eight whatever he did and i played division one golf my freshman year and one of the things that i talked a lot about with my coach was an idea called 4x4 breathing we would inhale for four seconds we would exhale and then whenever i got nervous on the course i would just return to that state of 4x4 breathing and i never had data on how my breathing affected my heart rate what have you found in that world well people who meditate in general have a much better heart rate variability so we do see that people who practice some form of mindfulness some form of meditation have on average higher heart rate variabilities than other people we also see that if you're someone who doesn't meditate and then you introduce meditation uh that too will lead to a higher heart rate variability and and there's a lot of reasons for that in many ways heart rate variability is a measurement of your breathing in the moment so it's not that surprising but i think it's quite powerful that the way you might just do a breathing exercise for 10 minutes in the morning today is going to then later affect how you sleep you know some 12 hours or 18 hours later i think that's quite fascinating yeah how do you like since you've started the company have you seen meditation practices become more common i mean certainly there's been the rise of headspace and calm and all of these apps but i wonder if it's different maybe at the professional level because there's been a similar thing that's happened with sleep where i've heard you talk a lot about how 20 30 years ago people weren't working out and now you go to a hotel gym or go to a hotel of course there's a gym and i think similarly there has been an increase in meditation but i don't know how much the stated consistency is versus the actual revealed consistency is among just average people so i wonder what it's like among athletes well let's see i mean i think athletes are constantly tinkering i think they're more they're tinkering more today than they were 10 years ago i i don't know if athletes are meditating more i think that they're probably thinking about it more you know athletes have always um gravitated towards visualization some athletes will do this intuitively some will do it in a very rehearsed way well what's the difference between intuitively and rehearsed way intuitively would be tiger woods you know walking down the fairway of the 18th hole and just knowing to himself that he's going to birdie the hole and like having a very clear image in his mind of doing that a sports psychologist would train a division one golfer how to do that in a coherent way you know there would be you would close your eyes there would be a breathing technique you would you would really focus on the emotion behind that you'd you'd really focus on the imagery behind that you would decide whether you wanted to be focused on that in the first person or the third person you know first person being i can see out of my own eyes the putt going in third person being i can see the the crowd around me and i can see myself making the putt so these are the sorts of things that in general athletes get exposed to especially in route to becoming a professional athlete i think probably more so in golf even than other sports because it is such an incredibly mental game and there's a lot of time in between shots you know a basketball player a lot of what a basketball player doing is is it's an uh intuitive in the moment right um lebron james doesn't necessarily need to visualize dunking on someone he just in the moment recognizes when he should you know uh golf you've got minutes uh sometimes up to 10 minutes before a shot so you have to figure out what you're going to do at that time and so you know my hunch and i've spent a fair amount of time with professional golfers now my hunch is that mindfulness and visualization are more popular within say professional golf than they would be within professional basketball i think there's another general question as to okay well how pervasive is mindfulness today i think a lot of people are are flirting with it i don't know if people have i i would be more curious to know how many people have actually created a practice around uh i for example have been doing transcendental meditation uh once or twice a day for six years straight wow so i think of that as a as a practice whereas you know if you download headspace and you know over the course of a week you meditate three times for 10 minutes each and then you don't do it for a month and then you remember you've got it and you do it once i don't know if that's someone who meditates i think of that as someone who's trying to you know experiment hmm have you well i'll ask a slightly different question why do you think that whoop has been so popular on the pga tour i know that you have a big deal with major league baseball you have one with golf what is it about those two sports that they have in common i'm like particularly surprised because golf is so slow to change as a culture and whoop feels like a bright exception to that rule it's been a pleasant surprise for me uh because i also love golf and i'll say this i mean the thing that makes woop relevant for a professional golfer a professional football player or you or me is that it's very good at helping you figure out how all these different things in your life affect you and professional golfers i think for a long time have taken for granted just how grueling it is as a sport i mean it really is quite quite a lot of work you know when we play golf we show up to the range 20 minutes before the round and then we go play 18 holes with our friends when these guys play golf i mean it's like it's like eight hours at the range it's it's then going to the gym it's then getting on a plane and jumping over three time zones it's then having a beer in the lobby it's then getting into a hotel it's then waking up the next day and doing it all over again and then trying to compete under stressful conditions to win a tournament and maybe not playing that well right so you have a situation which is actually a fair amount of of stress and it's not a big focus on on recovery and so i think that the reason whoop took off in golf is that these guys realized how much better they were at golf when they focused on sleep and recovery and i think the other reason uh it's done so well is they all have the game i mean they all have the game the 100th best player in the in the world can shoot a 65 at the best course right and and so they recognize that there's these other things that are going on that that separate the hundredth best player from the best player uh you know i've talked to a number of these guys who have gotten to be number one in the world and almost all of them will will say that you know there's not that big of a gap between them and the hundredth person in the world and so being able to focus on these things like how well you're sleeping what you're doing before bed how your body's recovering it actually can make an enormous difference in your performance what is a really memorable conversation or moment that you've had with one of the great players like who's just the person who you see you're like i love this guy i will say like i think professional golf in general is a unique group of athletes in that they're much more collaborative and this actually also answers why it grew so fast in golf you know roger federer and rafael nadal are not like texting each other tips right in fact they really want the other person probably not to be getting better whereas it professional golfers are shockingly collaborative and like i'm on text threads with justin thomas and rory mcilroy and they'll be sending out screenshots of their sleep before um the us open you know like oh look i'm in the green oh look i'm in the green and and and in fact justin got on because rory told him to get on woop right and you know here are two of the top five golfers in the world and uh what's been cool for me uh along with getting to know those two guys and they're terrific guys is um you know i was i was inside the bubble during uh the whole pga tour return to and and so it felt a little bit like joining a country club with 150 of the best golfers in the world i mean there was no one there it was just professional golfers and their caddies and the staff and and me and you know a few people from whoop i'm helping you know helping them all get their their whoop straps and so you know you just sit in the locker room and players are coming in and out and you know like i found myself having lunch with tony fenow and john rom and justin rose one day and and you know they were showing each other their their whoop data which i thought was the coolest thing obviously where they you know john was talking about how he doesn't get enough rem sleep and tony had gotten nine hours and 48 minutes of sleep and john was completely fascinated by how tony could get that much sleep and then they were talking about their sleeping habits and it was it was cool one to get to spend time with these guys but i think it was also quite fascinating to me that that was that's the culture within the pga tour and it's a very special culture you know i haven't i haven't seen that in other sports and i think the reason for it um and i think i think justin thomas may have said this to me but i think the reason for it is they don't feel like they're competing against each other as much as they're competing against themselves and the course and and the course and so you know and and their winning percentage is obviously super low right just by nature of the sport and so that that just makes them all i think a little bit more down-to-earth with each other yeah yeah it's a good answer i mean i think that looking back on my time at golf there's also it's so social just by nature i mean you use the tennis example nadal and federer seem to get along pretty well but with golf dustin johnson justin thomas and tiger woods they'll play at the same club they're all in in in florida and they do practice rounds together they spend quite a bit of time just hanging out just casually and i think it's because it has that sort of social dynamic and i think that you know you hear bryson and chambeau talk about what it was like to win the us open and he was like i beat the course this week he didn't say things like trying to beat the field and stuff it's you against the course and i think that to me that's one of the most appealing things about golf but you mentioned rem sleep and my roommate founded a health startup it went through y combinator the startup didn't work but he said that it's notoriously difficult to get sleep data and when it comes to my ore ring and my whoop the rem versus deep sleep data it is very different what's going on there and why is it so hard to capture sleep cycle data well it's interesting first of all capturing sleep data in it in that of itself is a fascinating concept because if you go to a sleep laboratory and you get hooked up to all these different uh contraptions uh most commonly known the polysomnograph which is really the the sort of gold standard and sleep measurement what happens is they they film me sleeping they look at the polysomnograph and and then two sleep clinicians will actually grade your sleep data and people don't realize this but those two sleep clinicians will actually agree with each other 67 of the time so like that's that actually seems kind of low if you think about it right like in terms of being able to accurately grade and we've gone to great lengths to be the most accurate sleep monitor on the market and if you look at our data alongside that gold standard it's really really accurate and we look at it by variations of um you know if a polysomnograph said you were in deep sleep by uh for 48 minutes um how long did whoops say you were in deep sleep okay that's plus or minus two minutes okay that's that's pretty encouraging and what's fascinating about rem sleep and slow wave sleep in particular and why it's important to measure these two periods of sleep is that rem sleep is when your brain is repairing it's when you're you're improving cognitive performance and if you're an executive if you're trying to perform at a high level mentally you need to be getting a lot of rem sleep and slow wave sleep is when your body produces about 95 of its human growth hormone so people think you get stronger in the gym you're actually kind of like tearing your muscles down in the gym you get stronger during slow wave sleep when you're repairing them and i bring this up because someone listening to this who doesn't measure if you ask them how much sleep they get what they will invariably do is they'll say well okay in the back their mind they'll go well i go to bed at 11 and i wake up at six so i get seven hours of sleep every night and it's like okay well actually if you were to measure that that's seven hours in bed right seven hours in bed does not actually translate to seven hours maybe you spend seven hours in bed and if you're pretty efficient you're getting six hours and 15 minutes of of sleep of quality sleep now within quality of sleep there's still this notion of light sleep versus ram and slow wave and by the way there's people who get six hours and 15 minutes of sleep and five and a half hours of that is light sleep right versus you could be getting six hours and 15 minutes of sleep and half of it is ram and slow wave and so when people say you know i think i'm a pretty good sleeper i don't know that i need to measure this stuff or i know i'm a bad sleeper i don't need to measure this stuff i think it's the most short-sighted point of view because it's a third of your life and you can actually change very small things and all of a sudden you're spending the same amount of time in bed you're still the guy who goes to bed at 11 and wakes up at six but you now are going from having 10 of that time in bed being rem and slow wave which is when you get all the value to having 50 or 60 percent and that alone can so meaningfully change the quality of your life and your performance it is shocking yeah i think that one of the struggles that i would imagine professional athletes have is i've heard that your sleep is noticeably worse when you're traveling and i don't know what they do to adapt to hotel beds but i once heard you say that away players in the nba get an hour less sleep than home players and what do you do for that how how do you have these controlled experiments i mean maybe you basically say okay i have a red light that i bring around and then i have the same pillow that i use and you try to replicate the environment maybe you try to do it with your pre-sleep habits but i don't know what you do there yeah look i mean it's it's part of the game and it's hard um the study you're referencing we actually did that with major league baseball and we found on average the away team got an hour less sleep than the home team so everyone sort of assumes that the home team wins because of the crowd and familiar stadium and and you know sort of these like known quantity things what if it's just that they get more sleep at home and and that that i think is quite quite an interesting concept now the other challenge that athletes have is they play late late games right and if you play a late game and a lot of athletes are taking some kind of a stimulant for that game some kind of a shake or some kind of caffeinated thing so you're having a caffeinated thing at like 7 p.m i mean you really don't want to have caffeine in your system after 2 pm so that just in itself is a huge challenge the other thing is you're playing under bright lights in front of screaming fans right so then you've got you got blue light that's stimulating your eyes and you got fans and adrenaline that's stimulating your body so you know your cortisol levels are elevated so it's it's kind of a perfect storm for someone not to be able to fall asleep and that's just independent from all the travel and and whatnot plus after they end the game they need to get some food in their system to recover so then you're ending a game at say 10 p.m you're getting food in your system 10 30 you actually don't necessarily want to fall asleep right after eating because the food that you eat will affect your digestion and excuse me your your sleep it will be affected if you eat close to the bed your your your body isn't as good at digesting food when you're sleeping and it also screws up your sleep quality so anyway that's a perfect storm for why it's hard but it's also it to me it underscores why it's so important to i mean i i really believe we will look back on professional athletes not measuring sleep and recovery as like the most insane thing ever it'll it'll be it'll be like uh baseball players smoking cigarettes in the dugout it'll it'll just seem that insane or people smoking on airplanes i always think about how how is possible you get on an airplane and people just start torching it up at 40 000 feet what are some of the constraints on getting inside the body in terms of like i was with a friend this morning we we went swimming at like seven in the morning in the in the river and he took off his levels his levels glucose tracker and then it basically by changing it up became waterproof but that is like a a needle i think in his arm but then it can measure a lot of glucose spiking what do you think that you'd be able to achieve if you did that and were is that even possible like are the constraints just too bad the data privacy is just too much of a risk how do you think about that well it's funny the things that humans are good at dreaming up tend to end up being reality and everyone seems convinced that at some point you're going to have sensors inside your body so it's almost more fun to just assume it's going to happen i i do feel like it would be worth doing to the extent that you're getting a data set that you can't otherwise get right but it does introduce new challenges as well like i've looked at implantables a little bit they have a one massive challenge is just battery life like how are you going to keep this thing powered that is inside your body and so then you ask yourself well could it be powered by your body or blood flow or could it be powered by movement you know similar to how certain watches work where they they're powered by mechanical movement uh the the reality is that just independent from this question of can you measure more by being inside the body the the um the mechanical engineering and the the battery questions of that are actually uh are actually bigger bigger problems you know for example so much of what woop does better than other products is data collection and data granularity but it would be impossible to collect that level of data if the if the sensor was trying to power itself you know because again we wanted to have the product be something that you never had to take off well wouldn't it be so clever if if it was charging itself through movement um it's just the battery the battery requirements are in a different stratosphere from what a you know little mechanical watch requires one of the things that frustrates me quite a bit about the wearables industry i mean i'm not like i have three wearables on right now and i'm trying to figure out what i like about it what i don't like about it and one of the things is that i feel like none of the individual platforms are actually working together and i think that this is how a lot of markets actually develop where there's a lot of markets that sort of come up and they all have these very specialized tasks and they all optimize on these very narrow domains and whoop is very clearly optimized for like heart tracking and raw performance data the apple watch is a more casual fitness aura for for sleep um and so it's a bit frustrating that there's no sort of easy way to link all the apis and have a centralized database and also there is the challenge in the space that you have the big tech companies who want to be on your body amazon has you know come in and they want to compete with you guys and then there's obviously apple which is just sort of like not quite the default option but it seems like those two big companies um like i remember pebble came out a couple years ago and i think that one of the big lessons that a lot of people took from pebble was don't compete against apple they're gonna beat you so what is your take on the industry given that it doesn't seem like there's good centralization and what it's like playing against these big tech companies well there's a lot of ways to answer that but i i think the first thing that comes to mind is what is your core purpose what is your why does your product exist and for woop the reason we've built a vertically integrated system is that we believe it's the very best way to drive behavior change and improve health so that's how we define success that's how we define our value proposition and if you look at people who've been on whoop for a year they have dramatically declining resting heart rates they have increasing heart rate variabilities they're sleeping longer and they're sleeping more consistently and those are actually dramatic improvements in health so there's there's a lot of signs that what we're doing is working as we think about adding layers to that story it's bringing in more data sources that could help us again unpack what you need to do to be a better version of yourself what can we tell you to do um i think a lot of behavior change comes from some you know some intervention of sorts it's not just enough to say you didn't sleep well last night it's it's you want to show you tell someone what can you do to sleep better it's not enough to say that maybe uh you know a low-carb diet is good for you or paleo is good for you or keto is good for you it's you have to explain that it's working you have to show that it's working or show that it's not working so this this sort of coaching layer uh to me is where is where whoop wants to live and to the extent that we can get other data sources to improve that we are going to and there's a lot of different ways to think about what those data sources will be and some of this i have to keep a little confidential but we want to build a platform where you are going to be able to improve your health and i appreciate some of your you know critiques on you know why why are you wearing three different products i i think there's a fair amount of overlap between aura and woop so in that case it's less obvious why to wear both of them i think in the case of uh woop and the apple watch they are actually serving different functions and i think the lesson from pebble was not necessarily don't compete with apple i think the lesson from pebble was don't do too many things in an average way and and you know they built a smart watch that didn't do anything really well it did a lot of things in a pretty and they also chose to build wearable technology wearable technology is one of the single hardest things to build because you have to be good at like at least five things i mean you have to be good at hardware you do good at software you have to put it in analytics you have to be good at design and you probably need some aspect of branding or community maybe both so that just makes the space insanely hard i mean nike failed in the space indeed has failed in the space under armour failed in the space microsoft failed in the space google's had a lot of start stops but they failed in the space intel failed in the space base has went out of business java went out of business there's there's a graveyard of stuff that failed in this space and it's in part because it's really hard but i think it's also in part because it's a lack of focus you have to be in my opinion very very succinct about why you're going to exist and for whoop there's a million reasons why we don't have a watch face there's a million reasons why we don't let you do push notifications and why the thing doesn't uh vibrate when your your phone just got a text message we want to live on two paradigms we want whoop to either be cool or we want it to be invisible and nothing in between and that's a pretty strong point of view i think if you look at a lot of wearable technology it was lost in the middle and you know the design of this stuff is pretty important how many things do you wear 24 7. not a lot i think whoop is my only one because i well i mean actually it is the only one because it's the only one that stays on my body i charge my apple watch and my aura ring every day i can't work out with my oar ring because i can't lift weights with it so whoop is actually the only thing which is kind of crazy right so so that's fairly intentional and it's again i think quite hard and given just how few things you wear 24 7 it emphasizes the difficulty of it talk about cool and invisible so cool is creating something that aesthetically you're willing to wear and i think that anything you wear 24 7 says something about you i mean what have been other fads that people have worn in a somewhat continuous way the livestrong bracelet you know i know lance armstrong armstrong's very out of style these days but there was a time when wearing a said a lot about you right you could kind of prototype someone once you saw that thing on their wrist and in many ways we're seeing the same thing develop with whoop where if you meet someone who wears whoop all of a sudden you start to paint a picture of someone who's aspirational maybe athletic but definitely aspirational and in my opinion that's a good thing i think you want to have a strong brand association especially if you're developing a wearable technology ask yourself what it would mean to you to see someone wearing an amazon wearable or a walmart wearable i don't want to say anything critical but all of a sudden it just creates a different framework in your mind of what does this person stand for what is this person's priorities because this isn't again just a utilitarian piece of technology it's something you're choosing to wear on your person to wear on your body and and for those reasons i think the the brand association and the design of the product are even more important than than is immediately obvious everyone says oh industrial design is important but it's actually in this specific case with wearable technology even more important and and so we spent a long time figuring out how would this thing be completely customizable and it's not an accident that like you can very quickly just take this sensor apart right and and swap in and out all sorts of different bands and have this be completely you know uh logoed uh to the moon and back so we want this to feel like a great representation of who you are and invisible is the other paradigm and that's one that i'm quite excited about and we're doing a lot of work on that which is really all i can say nice uh yeah i think technology becomes technology when it's invisible when we don't think about it and you know this is something that i'd like to do some philosophy about actually like i would at some point in life like to spend a couple years exploring the how invisible technologies impact us and i mean that in a actually a very different way than but i think there's another kind of invisible i think the invisible you're talking about is like electricity you sort of assume it's there you don't really think about it you turn on the lights without even thinking about it and it just sort of operates in this ambient fashion um there's another kind of invisible that i'm very interested in which is like clocks and mirrors these technologies that we no longer think about and i have a thesis that clocks created a culture of anxiety mirrors created a culture of narcissism and i would love to go study a lot of those ideas but i'm reminded of another famous saying that if you are serious about software you want to go build your own hardware talk about some of the challenges of building each of those and then we'll work through some of those five things that you mentioned before it's funny so you know i started when i was a senior at harvard uh and that was uh 2012. i mean technically the company was founded in 2011 and for nine years an enormous number of people told me not to build hardware i mean an overwhelming number of people told me to share with hardware and the the slick investor point of view on this was oh you should just leverage existing hardware and build the algorithms on top of it and and it's fascinating to me how many thought that was like like a novel point of view like a smart point of view like they had invented that point of view in the moment and they were so proud of it like almost like we couldn't have thought of that ourselves you know and and like and so i understand that it's it's sort of this this thing that that people believe which is that if you can create the the simplest path to victory um maybe that's going to be the quickest return and the best best bet but in fact if you are actually trying to build something that is that is uh i think truly new is truly trying to disrupt us a space or a market to be able to control every piece of the puzzle to have it be vertically integrated is such an enormous advantage and the other advantage to it is it's so ambitious and i didn't necessarily realize quite how ambitious it was at the time when i was sort of like realizing what i wanted to do but it's so ambitious that it actually attracts really really great talent and really really great because they're like this is this is kind of badass we're going to build every layer of this thing from scratch and we're going to control every bell and whistle and and now when we want to innovate there's like there's all these different axes that we can play on you know we can we can be innovating within the way we're collecting the data within the rate at which we're collecting the data within the sensing that we're doing within like the the rate at which we're transferring it it's it it's there's just an enormous power that comes to being able to own the entire stack and um what's an example of that from like a product that you've already launched like help me understand like what is something that you have done that you wouldn't have been able to do had you not owned the stack well i mean most of what you see on just the whoop overview screen we wouldn't be able to do without owning the stack in part because our hardware is differentiated uh but like okay let's let's take for example the fact that in 2000 and 15 fitbit came out with a uh their first wearable that could do heart rate and so you know again fill in the blank clever investor oh great this is an opportunity for you guys to sort of shelf the hardware developments you can just take heart rate from fitbit and put your algorithms on top of it and let's just assume for a second that people are willing to wear a fitbit forever which we've now seen is not the case people aren't willing to wear a fitbit forever but let's pretend they were the heart rate granularity with which they were collecting the data was inaccurate under different forms of motion so if you're trying to serve an audience that is initially athletic and doing a lot of different sports you actually can't control the accuracy of that heart rate data and you can't validate that the heart rate that you're putting into a score is actually weighted properly so if you want to give someone a strain analysis for a run or for weightlifting or for basketball and you can't trust the data that's going into it or you can't wait the probability of any given moment how accurate it is then you can't in turn give someone a score that's actionable or real and then it's just sort of like and out and i mean for a long time i wore a chest strap 24 7 a heart rate monitor chest strap uh because that actually gave me fairly accurate heart rate data which i could in turn create an accurate strain score with because the chest strap you know for all the issues with it was an accurate heart rate monitor now that's like a very simple point of view like that's a very simple analysis it gets so much more complicated like the reason that whoop is able to give you a recovery score that is pretty that that is that is accurate to your your state of being and accurate to how restored you are is sort of a few layers of things one it's it's the fact that we measure heart rate variability but so you might immediately say oh well but but uh this other product measures heart rate variability you could use that other product to give you a recovery score well wait we measure heart rate variability continuously but we only take the heart rate variability reading for recovery during the last five minutes of your slow wave sleep and the reason that's important is that heart rate variability is a very noisy statistic my heart rate variability right now in this moment may say nothing at all about my ability to perform in a somewhat athletic context later but it in fact was a very good predictor if you looked at it while i was sleeping last night and not just sleeping but during slow wave sleep so we take it every uh in the last five minutes of slow whip sleep because slowly sleep is when your body's literally repairing and as we talked about before it's when you're producing human growth hormone and by doing that and doing that night over for night overnight overnight we're able to build a control and that control then can you know be weighted against itself and that in turn can lead to a recovery score and so if we had just grabbed what a random piece or random hardware had said was your heart rate variability we wouldn't know at what point in the day it was captured we wouldn't know how accurately it was captured and for those reasons alone it would just be a completely worthless worthless so the idea that we could then build a score on top of it that could then have a coach to tell you what to do off of it you know oh you're green you should exercise this hard or you're red you should you should rest i mean again it wouldn't it wouldn't have worked it would have it would have all fallen over there would have been no efficacy we were talking earlier about let me just sort of summarize it at the risk of being too terse about other people telling you to be a capital light business you going vertically integrated and dealing with hardware which means that you're running now more capital intensive business the same thing could be said looking forward you're talking about coaching do you think that you would hire personalized coaches so like i would work with a coach and then i my subscription instead of 30 a month be 100 a month or do you think that there then there's like an opportunity at the software only layer to basically automate a lot of the coaching experience and basically have a handful of critical data points that say hey your strain score has been too low for the last eight days your hrv keeps going down we think that with how much you're training you are now at nine out of ten risk for injury is that how you see this going or what are you thinking about with the coaching well we're exploring a lot of different avenues of coaching i mean the first layer which is getting much more robust is just that we have a membership services team that in very short order you as a whoop member will just be able to text directly in the app and that team you could ask anything from why isn't my bluetooth pairing to hey i got an unusually low heart rate variability today what does that mean so that in itself is going to be an interesting human layer of coaching and we're going to build on top of that and so i'm excited to see where that takes it broadly speaking i think the most accurate coach for looking at your whoop will ultimately be the whoop ai that sits on top of all this information because that's the that's the the god view algorithm that can understand not just all these different things that are affecting me but the other 10 000 people on whoop who look identical to me right and and the learnings from that data set too and so yeah i'm i'm quite uh i'm quite encouraged that we're going to be able to build a and a a coach that is going to actually be able to tell you exactly what you need to do to improve and that is going to be a an ai it's not going to be a human cool switching gears here whoop is its own kind of media company i see the content trap a book behind you and you now have a podcast how have you thought about building a media company within work what has been your thinking behind doing that you know we we wanted from early like from a very early on we wanted woop to be a brand and that's a that's sort of a risky thing to say at an early stage of a business especially like before you have meaningful revenue and whatnot but it does create an orientation and and for us it was very important that when when whoop grew up and and we're now pretty close to being a you know a mature company that people would associate whoop with human performance and if they were going to ask themselves a question about human performance regardless of whether they were customer of whoop they would want to come to woop to answer that question so how do i sleep better that's a question that if someone asks we want them to come to whoop regardless of whether or not they wear whoop and that's in part what it means to be a brand is to have uh credibility around you know your universe and and you know so so some of these different categories that we've invested in like uh we have the locker which is a blog where we write about a lot of this stuff we have a podcast where we interview thought leaders athletes executives on what they're doing we've really detailed analysis on different types of scores and different types of physiological measurements all of that is to build a content engine that people can use to better understand their bodies regardless of whether they wear whoop or not and what of course has happened is that now society has also caught up you know eight years ago i was talking about heart rate variability no one cared what the hell heart rate variability was five years ago we were still talking about higher variability but if you searched for it whoop was on the 25th page today if you search for heart rate variability whoop is one of the answers for what is heart rate variability right and so you know that's seo and and whatever but it's it's building real estate that you believe is going to be valuable and then it's realizing that not only is that real estate a thousand acres rather than one acre from when you started a lot of people want to come to your real estate and so that's what it's been for us uh around content and that's how we've thought about it so what's it like to play augusta national i played augusta national in uh may of 2012 and uh a friend of mine uh at harvard's father was a member and we went down there and it was i mean it was surreal you know they they comb the squirrels it's uh it's just it's it's a special place it is a beautiful place it does feel like the home of golf it's worth the hype and you can't really help like walking around that golf course but like feeling a little bit of magic in the air the the hole that i thought was insanely that again it seemed actually less hard on television was uh 16 the par 3. wow so the whole the hole that tiger put it to like three feet when he won last year um that that whole thing was i mean that whole green is is really hard and i actually dropped a ball from where tiger made so the day we played it just to back up for a second was where they put the pin on um was where it was just by chance but it was where they put the pin on uh sunday of of of the masters you know it's that pin that's like kind of tucked uh towards the water and so i dropped the ball just for fun from where tiger had made that crazy chip you know um yeah and that ship is so hard it's like i i smile thinking about it like i think i chipped it to like 35 feet and i mean i'm you know i'm not a terrible golfer i'm like a three or four handicap and i think i chipped it to it was definitely i was definitely outside of 20 feet uh and i just it was just so cool that he he chipped that in and under the situation that he did so yeah look it was amazing to get to play that golf course incredibly grateful that's probably the top thing on my entire bucket list playing augusta you know one of the things i've been thinking a lot about and i think that bryson de chambeau has been sort of at the frontier of this i know i've been talking to the cincinnati reds pitching staff because i wrote an article about bryson and it went sort of viral and a lot of people in major league baseball in particular started reaching out and a lot of what we've been talking about is how being more analytical can make your intuition better and let me give an example here so there's been an interesting thing that's happened in the world of chess where a lot of the top players have been watching chess ais play and what's happened is it has re-oriented people's intuition for those who watch a lot of computer chess and there's a lot of moves that look ugly to the human eye but that are actually very effective moves and so my theory is that what you want to do is you want to practice analytically and then you want to improve your intuition but then when you perform you want to be intuitive so you're talking about lebron james earlier the way he's intuitive on the course same thing with bryson he wants to be more of an artist on the course even though he's very scientist very very science-minded off of it how would you think about some of those trade-offs i mean maybe we could even talk about your time playing playing squash like how much did you think about being analytical versus intuitive yeah i mean i i agree with you that i think in general you want practice to be analytical and you want performance to be intuitive which i think is what you're getting at you know i i think it's very hard to execute when you're being when you're too conscious of what you're of what you're doing you know the the holy grail which athletes get to every once in a blue moon is this concept of a flow state and the flow state is the very definition of it being completely intuitive i mean everything you're doing just comes completely naturally and you're you're almost like watching yourself in the act and i remember having one squash match like that where i beat i won my match against trinity and trinity at the time had won third they hadn't lost a match for 12 straight seasons it's the longest dynasty in in all of college sports they won some like insane number of matches straight and i i won my individual match we still lost as a team but i remember uh truly appreciating what this idea of a flu state was and and it's a fleeting thing i mean you you almost just feel like you're watching yourself do the thing and you're you're like amazed by how easy it feels and it's a hard thing to get back to josh whiteskin writes really well about this whole concept so i think yeah i think you have it right i think you know the the question becomes what are flow states outside of sports right you know how can you be analytical about your performance as an executive but then all of a sudden embody someone who's doing it intuitively or executing intuitively i think in general my process for running group is very intuitive i don't think i'm consciously but but then again you have these moments where you're consciously looking at your calendar and you're thinking okay well i say that recruiting is very important right now but how many hours a week am i actually spending recruiting and you sort of like okay well that's that's sort of where the analysis needs to come in because you need to sort of recalibrate um yeah well i think there's another cut on this that whoop shows that there's times where your feelings about can i play today can just be wrong and you can look at hrv and what people are saying and what they actually think is just wrong and so there's times whoop has proven that our intuition leads us astray a hundred percent and and look i mean one of the core reasons that whoop exists today was this belief that feelings are overrated you know feelings are overrated and and if you're a hard driving person it's particularly true because your feelings can betray you because your mind can betray you i mean this is why you see talented entrepreneurs burn out it's why you see great athletes over trained and get injured it's because their minds are able to push themselves to a place that actually isn't all that productive i started woo because i over trained as a college athlete and i wanted to know what day should i train hard or what day should i not train at all and and i think this this point about feelings being overrated is being actually really amplified during covet 19. you know covid i think has changed consumer psychology in a big way in this regard where you can be carrying a virus that you can't feel you're asymptomatic and you can give it to your grandmother and it can kill her and unfortunately this is happening every day in the world that as a psych like that as a as a shift in psychology is quite powerful and the reality is that you can measure things about your body to understand whether there's a meaningful shift occurring in your body and so it's why i'm so bullish on the whole the whole space and the whole concept of health monitoring is that i think you know i think it's inevitable that health monitoring can make people so much more aware so much healthier it can improve health care costs it can make you know can shift a lot of things to being preventative versus curative which is where you save a lot of money i i think it can be good in every way yeah i'm going to give you a thought experiment that i call the paradox of battery and it's probably my single biggest complaint about whoop i think that the battery lasts too long and let me tell you why this this this sounds ridiculous but battery life is more effective if it if you have to charge it every day because it becomes a habit and the reason why i don't have great data on my whoop the reason why i lose my charger all the time is well partially because it's mobile but i really just forget to charge it because i don't charge it every day and so i think that there's something very weird going on there with consumer behavior that analytically wouldn't make sense you would think that the longer the battery the better the product might not be the case well it depends what you're solving for but i'll give you the empirical answers to that paradox great the empirical answers to that paradox are that in fact having a five-day battery life versus a day and a half which is what we used to have our generation two was about a day and a half two days so it was one of those things where you had to charge it every night like you had to build that behavior um today with a five day battery life versus then with the sort of day and a half more people are are able to consistently upload data to the server so what that means is that having a longer battery life has improved efficacy of data collection despite what your point of view on on building a habit what we've also seen though is that more people are buying battery packs so our battery pack sales on a per person basis have also increased and i think what that signals is what you just described is that the the behavior of of not having this sort of habit every day of charging means that you'll put your charger somewhere and then four days later you'll forget where it is and you'll have lost your charger and and so that in turn is why people are also now buying more battery packs and and yeah i i think that in general we're going to keep trying to extend the battery life and i think we're probably okay with people buying battery packs too although i'd like them to get cheaper you know it might also flip at some margin right so let's just i'm not saying it's true but let's say that my thought experiment is true it might be the case that at 17 days now it becomes easier like certainly if you had an unlimited battery then you'd never run out of battery or if you only had to charge once a year and you had it the same place like that would probably be better so i don't know it'll be really interesting to look at a habit curve of that as we begin to close i think that one of the things is like there's a very david and goliath element of whoop which which i think that you're into and i think that it shows that you have been first to market with a lot of innovations and you've beaten a lot of companies that have a lot more money theoretically that shouldn't be possible what are you doing 01:0:0,630 --> 01:0:2,160 01:0:0,640 --> 01:0:3,440 differently in terms of the structure of 01:0:2,150 --> 01:0:3,440 01:0:2,160 --> 01:0:5,200 the business we talked about 01:0:3,430 --> 01:0:5,200 01:0:3,440 --> 01:0:6,799 control and pace earlier we talked about 01:0:5,190 --> 01:0:6,799 01:0:5,200 --> 01:0:7,599 delegating down we talked about your 01:0:6,789 --> 01:0:7,599 01:0:6,799 --> 01:0:10,640 obsession 01:0:7,589 --> 01:0:10,640 01:0:7,599 --> 01:0:10,640 what else comes out there 01:0:12,710 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:0:12,720 --> 01:0:16,799 well we have had a strong point of view 01:0:14,789 --> 01:0:16,799 01:0:14,799 --> 01:0:18,400 on the space and we've been 01:0:16,789 --> 01:0:18,400 01:0:16,799 --> 01:0:19,920 uh and for a while that point of view 01:0:18,390 --> 01:0:19,920 01:0:18,400 --> 01:0:23,040 was quite contrarian 01:0:19,910 --> 01:0:23,040 01:0:19,920 --> 01:0:24,880 i mean eight years ago when i spoke to 01:0:23,030 --> 01:0:24,880 01:0:23,040 --> 01:0:25,839 coaches and athletes just to start with 01:0:24,870 --> 01:0:25,839 01:0:24,880 --> 01:0:28,559 that market 01:0:25,829 --> 01:0:28,559 01:0:25,839 --> 01:0:29,680 about what they wanted they kept talking 01:0:28,549 --> 01:0:29,680 01:0:28,559 --> 01:0:31,520 about exercise 01:0:29,670 --> 01:0:31,520 01:0:29,680 --> 01:0:33,359 i mean oh could you give me more 01:0:31,510 --> 01:0:33,359 01:0:31,520 --> 01:0:35,040 information on gps could you give me 01:0:33,349 --> 01:0:35,040 01:0:33,359 --> 01:0:37,200 more information on sweat could you give 01:0:35,030 --> 01:0:37,200 01:0:35,040 --> 01:0:41,520 me more information 01:0:37,190 --> 01:0:41,520 01:0:37,200 --> 01:0:43,760 um you know on on video analysis 01:0:41,510 --> 01:0:43,760 01:0:41,520 --> 01:0:45,280 and and when i asked them well what are 01:0:43,750 --> 01:0:45,280 01:0:43,760 --> 01:0:47,920 your problems 01:0:45,270 --> 01:0:47,920 01:0:45,280 --> 01:0:49,839 it always came back to training 01:0:47,910 --> 01:0:49,839 01:0:47,920 --> 01:0:53,119 optimally and injuries 01:0:49,829 --> 01:0:53,119 01:0:49,839 --> 01:0:54,640 like player availability and and there's 01:0:53,109 --> 01:0:54,640 01:0:53,119 --> 01:0:56,720 a learning in this by the way which 01:0:54,630 --> 01:0:56,720 01:0:54,640 --> 01:0:57,520 which you learn as an entrepreneur over 01:0:56,710 --> 01:0:57,520 01:0:56,720 --> 01:0:59,280 01:0:57,510 --> 01:0:59,280 01:0:57,520 --> 01:1:0,960 you always want to ask customers for 01:0:59,270 --> 01:1:0,960 01:0:59,280 --> 01:1:2,480 their for what their problems are you 01:1:0,950 --> 01:1:2,480 01:1:0,960 --> 01:1:3,359 don't want to ask customers what their 01:1:2,470 --> 01:1:3,359 01:1:2,480 --> 01:1:5,440 solutions are 01:1:3,349 --> 01:1:5,440 01:1:3,359 --> 01:1:6,960 i love it customers are very good at 01:1:5,430 --> 01:1:6,960 01:1:5,440 --> 01:1:9,920 describing their problems 01:1:6,950 --> 01:1:9,920 01:1:6,960 --> 01:1:11,359 they often can can maybe mislead you 01:1:9,910 --> 01:1:11,359 01:1:9,920 --> 01:1:12,480 sometimes when they try to build that 01:1:11,349 --> 01:1:12,480 01:1:11,359 --> 01:1:14,079 solution 01:1:12,470 --> 01:1:14,079 01:1:12,480 --> 01:1:15,440 and it's really the role of a great 01:1:14,069 --> 01:1:15,440 01:1:14,079 --> 01:1:16,480 product team is to come up with the 01:1:15,430 --> 01:1:16,480 01:1:15,440 --> 01:1:19,839 01:1:16,470 --> 01:1:19,839 01:1:16,480 --> 01:1:22,160 so you know 01:1:19,829 --> 01:1:22,160 01:1:19,839 --> 01:1:23,839 i believe that the solution for those 01:1:22,150 --> 01:1:23,839 01:1:22,160 --> 01:1:25,760 problems was actually understanding the 01:1:23,829 --> 01:1:25,760 01:1:23,839 --> 01:1:27,520 other 20 hours of the day 01:1:25,750 --> 01:1:27,520 01:1:25,760 --> 01:1:29,200 i think you have a lot of information 01:1:27,510 --> 01:1:29,200 01:1:27,520 --> 01:1:30,559 already on exercise but i don't think 01:1:29,190 --> 01:1:30,559 01:1:29,200 --> 01:1:31,920 you know anything about how people are 01:1:30,549 --> 01:1:31,920 01:1:30,559 --> 01:1:33,440 sleeping and recovering 01:1:31,910 --> 01:1:33,440 01:1:31,920 --> 01:1:35,839 and i think if that got a hell of a lot 01:1:33,430 --> 01:1:35,839 01:1:33,440 --> 01:1:38,880 better maybe you could even exercise 01:1:35,829 --> 01:1:38,880 01:1:35,839 --> 01:1:41,040 more so so 01:1:38,870 --> 01:1:41,040 01:1:38,880 --> 01:1:42,880 that was the contrarian point of view 01:1:41,030 --> 01:1:42,880 01:1:41,040 --> 01:1:44,160 that sleep and recovery were more 01:1:42,870 --> 01:1:44,160 01:1:42,880 --> 01:1:46,559 important to performance than 01:1:44,150 --> 01:1:46,559 01:1:44,160 --> 01:1:50,480 performance itself or exercise 01:1:46,549 --> 01:1:50,480 01:1:46,559 --> 01:1:52,480 and the other contrarian point of view 01:1:50,470 --> 01:1:52,480 01:1:50,480 --> 01:1:54,799 was that the data needed to be really 01:1:52,470 --> 01:1:54,799 01:1:52,480 --> 01:1:57,839 accurate 01:1:54,789 --> 01:1:57,839 01:1:54,799 --> 01:1:59,039 uh there were so many opportunities to 01:1:57,829 --> 01:1:59,039 01:1:57,839 --> 01:2:2,400 make a quick buck 01:1:59,029 --> 01:2:2,400 01:1:59,039 --> 01:2:4,839 i mean we saw this with the companies 01:2:2,390 --> 01:2:4,839 01:2:2,400 --> 01:2:7,599 that just came quick to market with step 01:2:4,829 --> 01:2:7,599 01:2:4,839 --> 01:2:9,440 counters and 01:2:7,589 --> 01:2:9,440 01:2:7,599 --> 01:2:10,960 we were we were so stubborn about it 01:2:9,430 --> 01:2:10,960 01:2:9,440 --> 01:2:12,640 we're still stubborn about it today like 01:2:10,950 --> 01:2:12,640 01:2:10,960 --> 01:2:14,480 we don't think steps is relevant 01:2:12,630 --> 01:2:14,480 01:2:12,640 --> 01:2:16,480 it's a completely irrelevant metric in 01:2:14,470 --> 01:2:16,480 01:2:14,480 --> 01:2:18,000 my opinion in part because it's not even 01:2:16,470 --> 01:2:18,000 01:2:16,480 --> 01:2:19,520 measuring steps it's measuring how much 01:2:17,990 --> 01:2:19,520 01:2:18,000 --> 01:2:24,319 your arm moves 01:2:19,510 --> 01:2:24,319 01:2:19,520 --> 01:2:26,799 and and like you know so 01:2:24,309 --> 01:2:26,799 01:2:24,319 --> 01:2:28,400 so and again you look at all the 01:2:26,789 --> 01:2:28,400 01:2:26,799 --> 01:2:29,839 products even the apple watch it's 01:2:28,390 --> 01:2:29,839 01:2:28,400 --> 01:2:30,880 measuring steps which i think is the 01:2:29,829 --> 01:2:30,880 01:2:29,839 --> 01:2:34,000 silliest thing 01:2:30,870 --> 01:2:34,000 01:2:30,880 --> 01:2:36,079 so you know you one one 01:2:33,990 --> 01:2:36,079 01:2:34,000 --> 01:2:37,520 key to being different is truly being 01:2:36,069 --> 01:2:37,520 01:2:36,079 --> 01:2:38,960 different i mean you have you have 01:2:37,510 --> 01:2:38,960 01:2:37,520 --> 01:2:40,640 different points of view we've had 01:2:38,950 --> 01:2:40,640 01:2:38,960 --> 01:2:43,280 different points of view 01:2:40,630 --> 01:2:43,280 01:2:40,640 --> 01:2:45,520 uh we invented a recovery score when no 01:2:43,270 --> 01:2:45,520 01:2:43,280 --> 01:2:48,240 one was talking about recovery 01:2:45,510 --> 01:2:48,240 01:2:45,520 --> 01:2:48,640 and um you know and i think the other 01:2:48,230 --> 01:2:48,640 01:2:48,240 --> 01:2:52,400 bit 01:2:48,630 --> 01:2:52,400 01:2:48,640 --> 01:2:55,119 is we wanted to anchor whoop around 01:2:52,390 --> 01:2:55,119 01:2:52,400 --> 01:2:57,599 performance and athletics i believe that 01:2:55,109 --> 01:2:57,599 01:2:55,119 --> 01:2:59,440 one secret to owning health monitoring 01:2:57,589 --> 01:2:59,440 01:2:57,599 --> 01:3:1,440 was to not look like a tech company but 01:2:59,430 --> 01:3:1,440 01:2:59,440 --> 01:3:3,200 to look like a sports apparel brand 01:3:1,430 --> 01:3:3,200 01:3:1,440 --> 01:3:4,480 when whoop grows up we want to look like 01:3:3,190 --> 01:3:4,480 01:3:3,200 --> 01:3:5,839 nike we don't want to look like 01:3:4,470 --> 01:3:5,839 01:3:4,480 --> 01:3:8,640 microsoft 01:3:5,829 --> 01:3:8,640 01:3:5,839 --> 01:3:9,839 and and by the way that was another 01:3:8,630 --> 01:3:9,839 01:3:8,640 --> 01:3:11,440 decision that was 01:3:9,829 --> 01:3:11,440 01:3:9,839 --> 01:3:13,839 you know it was like more expensive and 01:3:11,430 --> 01:3:13,839 01:3:11,440 --> 01:3:14,640 hard which has sort of been a recurring 01:3:13,829 --> 01:3:14,640 01:3:13,839 --> 01:3:16,079 theme and like 01:3:14,630 --> 01:3:16,079 01:3:14,640 --> 01:3:18,480 you know if whoop had failed a couple 01:3:16,069 --> 01:3:18,480 01:3:16,079 --> 01:3:19,119 years ago the critique would have been 01:3:18,470 --> 01:3:19,119 01:3:18,480 --> 01:3:21,200 what you were 01:3:19,109 --> 01:3:21,200 01:3:19,119 --> 01:3:22,240 what you tried to do was two was too 01:3:21,190 --> 01:3:22,240 01:3:21,200 --> 01:3:24,400 01:3:22,230 --> 01:3:24,400 01:3:22,240 --> 01:3:26,559 and and we almost did fail you know it's 01:3:24,390 --> 01:3:26,559 01:3:24,400 --> 01:3:28,640 uh it's it's taken a lot of resilience 01:3:26,549 --> 01:3:28,640 01:3:26,559 --> 01:3:30,480 to get where we are today 01:3:28,630 --> 01:3:30,480 01:3:28,640 --> 01:3:32,079 but but that turned out to be a you know 01:3:30,470 --> 01:3:32,079 01:3:30,480 --> 01:3:33,359 an incredible anchoring 01:3:32,069 --> 01:3:33,359 01:3:32,079 --> 01:3:35,839 you know the fact that these 01:3:33,349 --> 01:3:35,839 01:3:33,359 --> 01:3:38,240 professional athletes organically wear 01:3:35,829 --> 01:3:38,240 01:3:35,839 --> 01:3:39,599 and buy whoop is so incredibly 01:3:38,230 --> 01:3:39,599 01:3:38,240 --> 01:3:43,119 validating 01:3:39,589 --> 01:3:43,119 01:3:39,599 --> 01:3:44,799 and we believe for the longest time that 01:3:43,109 --> 01:3:44,799 01:3:43,119 --> 01:3:46,880 you know there was no amount of money we 01:3:44,789 --> 01:3:46,880 01:3:44,799 --> 01:3:48,480 could pay an athlete to wear whoop 01:3:46,870 --> 01:3:48,480 01:3:46,880 --> 01:3:50,240 if they didn't get value out of it and 01:3:48,470 --> 01:3:50,240 01:3:48,480 --> 01:3:52,079 on the flip side 01:3:50,230 --> 01:3:52,079 01:3:50,240 --> 01:3:53,760 we believed if we truly could tell them 01:3:52,069 --> 01:3:53,760 01:3:52,079 --> 01:3:55,200 like exercise hard today or don't 01:3:53,750 --> 01:3:55,200 01:3:53,760 --> 01:3:56,720 exercise at all or go to bed at this 01:3:55,190 --> 01:3:56,720 01:3:55,200 --> 01:3:58,319 time or wake up at that time or 01:3:56,710 --> 01:3:58,319 01:3:56,720 --> 01:3:59,920 or this supplement's good for you this 01:3:58,309 --> 01:3:59,920 01:3:58,319 --> 01:4:2,079 supplement is bad for you if we could 01:3:59,910 --> 01:4:2,079 01:3:59,920 --> 01:4:5,520 truly deliver on that value 01:4:2,069 --> 01:4:5,520 01:4:2,079 --> 01:4:8,720 then they would pay us for the product 01:4:5,510 --> 01:4:8,720 01:4:5,520 --> 01:4:10,640 and so those were some of the 01:4:8,710 --> 01:4:10,640 01:4:8,720 --> 01:4:12,880 points of view we had that i would say 01:4:10,630 --> 01:4:12,880 01:4:10,640 --> 01:4:15,280 were hard driving points of view 01:4:12,870 --> 01:4:15,280 01:4:12,880 --> 01:4:16,559 that were very like you know look we 01:4:15,270 --> 01:4:16,559 01:4:15,280 --> 01:4:17,920 were just looking at all the same 01:4:16,549 --> 01:4:17,920 01:4:16,559 --> 01:4:19,200 information but we were looking at it 01:4:17,910 --> 01:4:19,200 01:4:17,920 --> 01:4:22,480 very differently 01:4:19,190 --> 01:4:22,480 01:4:19,200 --> 01:4:23,920 than other companies and uh and it's 01:4:22,470 --> 01:4:23,920 01:4:22,480 --> 01:4:25,280 you know it served us well and now i 01:4:23,910 --> 01:4:25,280 01:4:23,920 --> 01:4:27,760 think we have a pretty passionate 01:4:25,270 --> 01:4:27,760 01:4:25,280 --> 01:4:30,000 community that's building on itself 01:4:27,750 --> 01:4:30,000 01:4:27,760 --> 01:4:32,400 and it's a community that likes the 01:4:29,990 --> 01:4:32,400 01:4:30,000 --> 01:4:36,720 affiliation with woop which is a 01:4:32,390 --> 01:4:36,720 01:4:32,400 --> 01:4:39,119 in turn a sort of self fulfilling cycle 01:4:36,710 --> 01:4:39,119 01:4:36,720 --> 01:4:40,960 where you've got something where people 01:4:39,109 --> 01:4:40,960 01:4:39,119 --> 01:4:42,640 like the feeling of the brand 01:4:40,950 --> 01:4:42,640 01:4:40,960 --> 01:4:44,559 they like what it says about themselves 01:4:42,630 --> 01:4:44,559 01:4:42,640 --> 01:4:45,920 wearing it so then in turn they wear it 01:4:44,549 --> 01:4:45,920 01:4:44,559 --> 01:4:47,280 more so then they get more of their 01:4:45,910 --> 01:4:47,280 01:4:45,920 --> 01:4:48,400 friends to wear it and then you 01:4:47,270 --> 01:4:48,400 01:4:47,280 --> 01:4:51,760 all of a sudden you've created a 01:4:48,390 --> 01:4:51,760 01:4:48,400 --> 01:4:54,000 flywheel last question go back to you 01:4:51,750 --> 01:4:54,000 01:4:51,760 --> 01:4:56,000 to you when you're senior at harvard 01:4:53,990 --> 01:4:56,000 01:4:54,000 --> 01:4:58,079 2012 what do you 01:4:55,990 --> 01:4:58,079 01:4:56,000 --> 01:4:59,440 think you would say to yourself if you 01:4:58,069 --> 01:4:59,440 01:4:58,079 --> 01:5:0,960 could tell yourself one thing that 01:4:59,430 --> 01:5:0,960 01:4:59,440 --> 01:5:3,039 you've learned whether it's about health 01:5:0,950 --> 01:5:3,039 01:5:0,960 --> 01:5:4,480 exercise science how to live how to run 01:5:3,029 --> 01:5:4,480 01:5:3,039 --> 01:5:6,880 a business what is it 01:5:4,470 --> 01:5:6,880 01:5:4,480 --> 01:5:8,079 that you think is the the kernel of 01:5:6,870 --> 01:5:8,079 01:5:6,880 --> 01:5:12,400 wisdom that you've learned 01:5:8,069 --> 01:5:12,400 01:5:8,079 --> 01:5:12,400 since actually founding this company 01:5:13,510 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:5:13,520 --> 01:5:16,799 don't give up i mean keep going i i 01:5:16,390 --> 01:5:16,799 01:5:16,400 --> 01:5:20,400 think 01:5:16,789 --> 01:5:20,400 01:5:16,799 --> 01:5:22,400 truly you know that that was really my 01:5:20,390 --> 01:5:22,400 01:5:20,400 --> 01:5:24,960 attitude for the last 10 years 01:5:22,390 --> 01:5:24,960 01:5:22,400 --> 01:5:26,799 but it is hard man i mean it's very hard 01:5:24,950 --> 01:5:26,799 01:5:24,960 --> 01:5:28,240 and you know this you spend time with 01:5:26,789 --> 01:5:28,240 01:5:26,799 --> 01:5:31,920 other founders and 01:5:28,230 --> 01:5:31,920 01:5:28,240 --> 01:5:33,680 and you're entrepreneurial yourself like 01:5:31,910 --> 01:5:33,680 01:5:31,920 --> 01:5:34,960 it's hard it's lonely there's times 01:5:33,670 --> 01:5:34,960 01:5:33,680 --> 01:5:38,240 where you really feel like 01:5:34,950 --> 01:5:38,240 01:5:34,960 --> 01:5:40,240 you can't do anything right an enormous 01:5:38,230 --> 01:5:40,240 01:5:38,240 --> 01:5:42,160 the other thing about building something 01:5:40,230 --> 01:5:42,160 01:5:40,240 --> 01:5:43,280 that's ambitious that i didn't fully 01:5:42,150 --> 01:5:43,280 01:5:42,160 --> 01:5:45,440 realize 01:5:43,270 --> 01:5:45,440 01:5:43,280 --> 01:5:46,480 is the number of people that will tell 01:5:45,430 --> 01:5:46,480 01:5:45,440 --> 01:5:48,400 01:5:46,470 --> 01:5:48,400 01:5:46,480 --> 01:5:49,920 you can't do it the number of people 01:5:48,390 --> 01:5:49,920 01:5:48,400 --> 01:5:52,240 that will tell you that you're going to 01:5:49,910 --> 01:5:52,240 01:5:49,920 --> 01:5:52,240 fail 01:5:52,630 --> 00:aN:NaN,NaN 01:5:52,640 --> 01:5:59,359 there's something about crazy ideas 01:5:56,630 --> 01:5:59,359 01:5:56,640 --> 01:6:1,039 being a good thing right like it's a 01:5:59,349 --> 01:6:1,039 01:5:59,359 --> 01:6:3,760 crazy idea that you would want to 01:6:1,029 --> 01:6:3,760 01:6:1,039 --> 01:6:5,680 rent your bedroom out to a stranger but 01:6:3,750 --> 01:6:5,680 01:6:3,760 --> 01:6:6,799 that's airbnb right that was a crazy 01:6:5,670 --> 01:6:6,799 01:6:5,680 --> 01:6:10,160 idea 01:6:6,789 --> 01:6:10,160 01:6:6,799 --> 01:6:12,880 um but like 01:6:10,150 --> 01:6:12,880 01:6:10,160 --> 01:6:15,280 if you have these sort of wild ambitious 01:6:12,870 --> 01:6:15,280 01:6:12,880 --> 01:6:16,880 points of view on the world 01:6:15,270 --> 01:6:16,880 01:6:15,280 --> 01:6:19,359 in part they don't exist because a lot 01:6:16,870 --> 01:6:19,359 01:6:16,880 --> 01:6:21,200 of people don't think they can exist 01:6:19,349 --> 01:6:21,200 01:6:19,359 --> 01:6:23,599 and what that in turn does is it makes 01:6:21,190 --> 01:6:23,599 01:6:21,200 --> 01:6:27,039 you a magnet for criticism 01:6:23,589 --> 01:6:27,039 01:6:23,599 --> 01:6:28,880 and and negative feedback 01:6:27,029 --> 01:6:28,880 01:6:27,039 --> 01:6:30,079 and and that was hard for me i think 01:6:28,870 --> 01:6:30,079 01:6:28,880 --> 01:6:31,760 over the years it was 01:6:30,069 --> 01:6:31,760 01:6:30,079 --> 01:6:34,400 it's also hard if you're a very young 01:6:31,750 --> 01:6:34,400 01:6:31,760 --> 01:6:35,680 person because so much of your identity 01:6:34,390 --> 01:6:35,680 01:6:34,400 --> 01:6:37,839 as a 01:6:35,670 --> 01:6:37,839 01:6:35,680 --> 01:6:38,960 as a business person is also tied up in 01:6:37,829 --> 01:6:38,960 01:6:37,839 --> 01:6:40,880 the company 01:6:38,950 --> 01:6:40,880 01:6:38,960 --> 01:6:43,440 it's why i think you can sort of develop 01:6:40,870 --> 01:6:43,440 01:6:40,880 --> 01:6:44,880 an unhealthy relationship with your work 01:6:43,430 --> 01:6:44,880 01:6:43,440 --> 01:6:47,119 in turn 01:6:44,870 --> 01:6:47,119 01:6:44,880 --> 01:6:49,039 because you know so much of your 01:6:47,109 --> 01:6:49,039 01:6:47,119 --> 01:6:50,079 identity again is tied up in the success 01:6:49,029 --> 01:6:50,079 01:6:49,039 --> 01:6:52,160 of the thing that you've 01:6:50,069 --> 01:6:52,160 01:6:50,079 --> 01:6:53,760 spent so much time building so there's a 01:6:52,150 --> 01:6:53,760 01:6:52,160 --> 01:6:54,880 real vulnerability i think that i'm 01:6:53,750 --> 01:6:54,880 01:6:53,760 --> 01:6:58,079 getting at 01:6:54,870 --> 01:6:58,079 01:6:54,880
